Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not friendly .
they both wanted to implement the implementation of international agreement and Teheran to speak dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
however , in the meeting there should also be a conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing municipal building of Israel and raises Netanyahu &apos;s lack at the peace process .
the deal continued by Obama wor@@ shi@@ ped the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continued to deterior@@ ate .
in March , Netanyahu was held at the invitation of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress that partially exploited as an affair against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , his friend shot dead
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon lamb re@@ told with a certain poor voice of the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house .
it was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house , the officials found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note , which was pressed on a white block , I loved it , I loved it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that lamb , who had travelled into two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , who had already travelled for 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was killed and killed by the police for a popular business professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police officer Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford told that all @-@ quality employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that lamb made the f@@ ate@@ ful emergency call sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day , there was a further death : lamb took life , when police en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated him .
one day after shooting in the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to pro@@ cure itself a picture of what was motivated .
the details published by the agents at the both ends of the state are details , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped them to draw a picture of a talented , but potentially difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , he did not have history of violence or criminal history .
Schmidt himself mentioned it in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; where he divided his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations related to problem@@ atic behavior .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a , who praised the Lamb , said that he was too excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to health care for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year , he only taught two online courses .
the latest changes in employment policy of the university means that the promotion , for which the Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not give him any warranty for an automatic way to be Assistant Assistant Professor .
President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knows nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course , there was something in Mr Lam@@ p Ide@@ a . &quot;
these are questions , the Lamb can &apos;t answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs , when he returned to Mississippi out of Arkan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran in the entry .
it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants , teaching ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he earned his doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the many years @-@ long girl@@ friends described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and fun .
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
they and their friends were high school and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar play .
back then he was the s@@ warm of women .
the girl melted away when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 , and in the Jackson &apos;s city of Bran@@ don .
lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no evidence from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house , ad@@ mi@@ red to a Ba@@ you at G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were left over 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues .
lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up three years ago for three years .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes , sings their own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse , who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a fe@@ eb@@ le at G@@ auti@@ er , said that he was Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ iss Night on the night 5 September for the last time after it ended his guitar and harmon@@ ic qu@@ ad finished before a fantastic audience .
there was no evidence that anything was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the ti@@ dying and j@@ est@@ ing together .
I mean they both had a good sense for jo@@ king .
Schmidt , the t@@ ote Professor , led the first semester program and specialised in American natives and colonial history , &quot; Don Allan Mitchell said , is a English teacher at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday night , about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cleveland , including teachers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commemorative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the memorial watch while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the class@@ room is resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had shot the emergency after he had killed Schmidt and that he described the lamb as his wife , but there is no indication of that the two have been married .

Michael J. Fox j@@ umped over his &quot; Date &quot; Princess Diana
back to the Future , &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre at the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in mind that I am a sim@@ ulated guest , and a cross@@ line length of it , with the prin@@ cess of Wales on a date .

UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
ban Ki @-@ moon tells his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN Group once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to finding a political solution .
ban on Wednesday said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Minister of the five permanent member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the minist@@ erial Meeting of the General Assembly , to discuss the situation in Syria .
he regre@@ ts that insur@@ rection in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers can make this situation dis@@ soluble . &quot;
ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria with the crisis that they have demonstrated along with Iran &apos;s nuclear de@@ vot@@ ion .
8 Com@@ preh@@ ensive values show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have attempted to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to move Donald Tr@@ ump from the above p@@ olls at the bottom , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump into two @-@ digit range , and some comm@@ itting to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republican nom@@ ination .
experts have been showing that Rick Per@@ r@@ ys gave lead to the rising Herman Cain &apos;s leadership in 2011 , of which no one won only one state in the nomin@@ ating process .
and there are many reasons why he would have had to fight in a general election .
but outdoor groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now detect tr@@ um@@ ps stamina and start to flow their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some recent surveys , which indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary stage :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity example have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
some three out of ten say they have negative opinion .
and these figures remain in the early states .
the Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa saw last week that 60 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters are happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CNN pol@@ l / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
just two of 10 say they would be &quot; angry , &quot; if the candidate were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent , they would be thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 per cent who say the same over Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; angry , &quot; if Je@@ w@@ Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely used for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive testim@@ onies , 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul says that ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first state state of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute effectively his position , and almost six out of 10 independent say that his temper@@ ament not to the White House , thus ABC / post .
republi@@ can voters are getting used to the idea .
when they open their sin@@ cer@@ ity , republi@@ can voters keep the dump in real .
if you are asked who the GO@@ P nom@@ ination is the most likely who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say a survey from CNN / OR@@ C last week four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time , when four of July their money put their money to Je@@ w@@ Bush .
full publication : GO@@ P voters had not the clear crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans expected that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P voters will be plau@@ sible campaign than plau@@ sible campaign .
even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump beats , even almost everyone .
some experts suggest that the breaking field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps lead , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump will reap the majority .
he left Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points ahead of Walker 15 points , in front of Je@@ w@@ Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would cr@@ ush the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on head .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans tells us that they have formed their mind .
a new survey from C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters , the dump support , say that they have fixed its voices .
of course , much will happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 per cent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ der , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind , are twice as frequently for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump has been taking part in his election campaign two months ago by immigrants from Mexico . &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; was immigration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course for 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expres@@ sive Hisp@@ ano Americans will be remote @-@ kept by the Republican Party and will damage the territorial effort .
but after the new ABC / post survey conducted by Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans agree that they agree with tr@@ ump regarding issues of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the lim@@ el@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump would seem to do well , too .
the fru@@ stration about the government clim@@ bs to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , more than half of the support of republi@@ can voters now affects approximately half of the support of Republican voters .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Io@@ wa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four Io@@ wa rep@@ ublic@@ ans have fru@@ str@@ ated at Congress , 54 percent , &quot; un@@ happy , &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg place there is the most expensive residential community - overlooking the North Sea .
the street will cost a square meter space of an average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euros .
&quot; in Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is natural , &quot; it says in the study - thus the high price .
a new study shows what particular locations will cost a square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student booking in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top residential areas , one of the price comes as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate Services Engel &amp; Eth@@ ers published a leaderboard for the most exclusive German motor@@ homes - with square met@@ er@@ ors in dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros not - per square meter .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here just not on top .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double @-@ time keeper in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a convincing pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions @-@ League @-@ season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze had a dream start at the &quot; mission Milan &quot; in the hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pir@@ ating a dream start to the &quot; mission Milan . &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympic champion in hot atmosphere thanks to land@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ ed hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth Hour success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28th , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller was awarded the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ Gui@@ ded Mi@@ th@@ wart @-@ Tor@@ s@@ Roberto , who had a place for a fl@@ ank of the World Champion , held on 28 February in the Champions League for Bavaria .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate that , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised a career in front of the game in the Car@@ ls@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich @-@ speaking voices .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated not@@ ion , not to shine .
Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the Royal class , among them against famous clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
but Bavaria , in seven Europe @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next sacrifice .
they went to brave , in their revealed efforts , but often to be inv@@ inci@@ ble .
attacks were diver@@ ted along on the left side of the left side of the left , Douglas , on the left side of the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more fortunate enough than his fl@@ ank lost in the right hemisphere at the left upper to@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champ@@ ions the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first of all , when Olympic @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown found the head of the poles on the line ( 26th ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the Tor@@ were asked Roberto with his knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bayern celebrated her domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ raeus could set up the con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous spot .
but then , let &apos;s leave the door of the door .
for instance , when he le@@ aked a shot of ideas on the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola put a four @-@ chain four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ vern , sat initially outside .
the F@@ WC hero had given the green light only after finishing the final training , &quot; said Sports Officer Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to do something else that is quite v@@ icious . &quot;
also at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought the King@@ sley Com@@ an for his frag@@ ile Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear after 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still has one better .
before the game , it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ al .
after a smaller group of sometimes reported Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator , the followers of hosts Pi@@ raeus had apparently prov@@ oked in words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with r@@ attle against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was taken from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
the one who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also counting the counting of a Potsdam &apos;s long term study .
the good news : in deci@@ du@@ ism the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smoking have a considerably increased risk of losing her teeth early .
this is out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to smoking , smokers lay at the risk of losing their teeth mat@@ urely in order to lose the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ che .
the scientists had more than 23@@ 300 participants .
main causes of teeth are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ izes DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth@@ loss are therefore back on frequent dent@@ ures in smokers .
this is not clari@@ fied in how much smoking is also increased the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking at smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the threat comes back on the level of qu@@ itting smoking , first @-@ aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one needs to convince humans , non @-@ smoking , stated study of H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shortened the life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and recept@@ acles and leads to our knowledge of good health to the high age .
in Germany , over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 must be affected by per@@ il@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E distributed .
earlier studies have already noted that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists at Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ nants of the late anti@@ quity

in the proximity of the construction site for the new Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ischer Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans have been looking for soil thinking .
at all construction projects in Cologne city district , the museum will always be moved as a department for arch@@ eological soil .
in the third section of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , the archae@@ ologists have now found a look .
from text documents , it was already known that a fortress and in the 8th century have had a church standing , explained Trier .
in addition to the rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church , a cemetery with some 350 graves have been discovered , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
the European Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system , which is planned over the planned trans@@ atl@@ antic trade agreement TT@@ IP .
the controversial private sha@@ des for disp@@ utes between concert and states are to be replaced by a transparent system , which is considerably more traditional dishes in its functionality .
&quot; we want to set up a system that trust the citizens , &quot; stated the EU @-@ Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström .
the Swe@@ de presented the proposal to launch a European negoti@@ ating position in the EU negoti@@ ating talks with the United States .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedures will be con@@ sign@@ alled that the EU states and the US chose an independent judge for a new investment farm .
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the United States , and third @-@ party states .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to elev@@ ate objec@@ tion to jud@@ gements .
so far the operations agreed to refer@@ ee , an in@@ quired date against their judgments .
in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in matters of fair@@ ness and justice , commented at Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , they want to move to an International Investment Regional Court .
there , for example , disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied here .
most of the major corporations required by major companies ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe to TT@@ IP .
the traditional lit@@ igation are critic@@ ised by contra@@ ctors as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , over the company claims for compensation of tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws , or to reduce consumer and environmental standards .
in the first opinion , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as camp@@ act submitted the proposals of the EU Commission as in@@ sufficient .
it was especially critic@@ ised that they are not supposed to apply free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
however , the German economic secretary of Matthias Mach@@ ines ( SPD ) described the plans as a great progress .
the Commission , considering the reform of significant points , have developed the Federal Minister for Finance Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade minist@@ ries .
the old system of private bit@@ es was the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned that there would be many new rules in favour of the economy .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises may be dis@@ advant@@ aged , and named it .
when the talks about the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ l@@ antic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded well on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
the topic of investor protection has not been discussed so far with the USA .
originally , an agreement for the agreement was originally expected to stand at the end of this year .
this date is no longer att@@ itu@@ de@@ able .

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ h made his debut at the opening of the Prime Minister with tension .
the new Labour president Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will be on the prime minister of the Prime Minister for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to the first of its six given questions , shortly after lunch , with the media probably checked by the media and the Labour MPs out of the vicinity .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n leadership , as it comes to the appointment of the shadow of donation and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour Group &apos;s decision to remain in silence during a mem@@ oration ceremony to commemor@@ ate the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cr@@ iti@@ que of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the centre of several cover @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ no &apos;s decision not to sing the National@@ hy@@ mn , has drawn attention to itself
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had stood &quot; in respec@@ tful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , talked on the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he told the Labour President to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ns , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve with Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called for differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Euro @-@ Parliamentary Party supported him as leader .
the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be st@@ acked within Labour &quot; by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n utter@@ ances to the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , the TU@@ C Conference , said Labour changes to remove all the idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pensions , said that the party &quot; is &quot; very clear , &quot; that it is only against the government plans to lower the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the fifth Labour Chair , David Cameron , since he is chief of T@@ ory leader , over the final decade on the Disp@@ atch Box in Parliament over the past decade .
the Labour Group , promised to another political approach , says that he gave &quot; Crow@@ d &quot; sour@@ ced &quot; Ide@@ as for questions on Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ative and that he will under@@ go both &quot; impact resistance &quot; and spreading mil@@ king with obstacles and instead demonstrated to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minist@@ ries , is represented , if he does not take part - for example when Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into being speaking , that other colleagues occasionally seize the Word and that he asked John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem .
in 2005 , when he became the leader , Mr Cameron announced that he would remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ The@@ aters &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister of the Prime Minister . however , a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on TV in 1990 , the dis@@ sent@@ ery with the Prime Minister became the most important bar@@ omet@@ re of a leader and his position under his par@@ liament@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that she had become a caric@@ ature and require further reforms .

met@@ eor poster gives Lebanese on the potato @-@ bass @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it &apos;s both - and indeed in the potato d@@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ al @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the saying &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the p@@ ic movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a s@@ ke@@ wer .
the idea brought him to the idea of a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen acci@@ dental on TV .
since then , in its shop there is a barbecue s@@ ke@@ w , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has become in the patent attor@@ neys in Munich meanwhile .
according to the agency , it has been protected as utility models since recently .
how much flesh and how much potatoes of the s@@ ke@@ wer contains , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds .
also with its customers the culinary international understanding will come well .
Met@@ cash kicks off Land Dis@@ miss@@ al Camp@@ a@@ ign for Com@@ b@@ ating Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fest@@ ation
met@@ cash is trying to protect IG@@ A branches in front of a Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a ground@@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A reta@@ iler in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets are prepared with local food vendors and build the IG@@ A brand with the instream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough that distri@@ butes samples and shops in IG@@ A stores and shop@@ keeper who sell used tickets for the South Australian football League to loyal customers .
it is expected to be published further details of its Defence Strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers of whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers , alcohol and devices will carry out its annual investors strategy .
it is much at stake , because South Australia and Western Australia generate nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A cat@@ stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously Provin@@ cial and IG@@ A reta@@ iler have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - over 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts as Morgan Stanley said that Al@@ di takes about five percent of the food market in these two states after opening his first markets and take away all existing actors , but primarily independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley said IG@@ A reta@@ iler 360 million revenues per year and cash will lose 250 million $ by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di is opening 25 locations in SA and 30 in WA , and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and grocery , and with the amounts on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high facing charges could cost $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stanley assumes that met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in food and grocery around 3.8 percent in 2016 , to 4.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and to reduce its market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , who founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business meeting in Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to be eliminated during a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ A market share has been reduced from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has around 1,200 IG@@ A reta@@ iler since 2012 , is reflected in the operating debt reduction in terms of sales and mar@@ gins .
the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers we@@ ars up and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ to attack selling prices with Col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week to improve their stores of faster fresh food and provide a better choice of private @-@ label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main Managing Director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the wholesale prices and store rehabilitation programs are to be gay and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of Australian tennis and Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral injuries &quot; in the shortest storm surrounding his friend Nick C@@ us@@ gios and deserves to view the President of the Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly seems to be a cr@@ iti@@ que for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is called the &quot; Special KS &quot; by the in@@ famous con@@ frontation with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA for the Montreal Masters in the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent had to be separated with the refer@@ ees , where Harrison cried : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to suggest : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would suggest that I should punch the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp sp@@ orted a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I am reas@@ onably priced , is the fact that after my opinion Than@@ asi was pulled down a little in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken up a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a t@@ amp@@ er in the US Open , but he is not the first player to make a bat of Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of them .
but , really , he really beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ved much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around itself , and I think he was a little too tight .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he never fits a problem with the other players he is practic@@ ing hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own services .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into account the C@@ yr@@ gios in the important decision which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everybody , but he sec@@ ures the man out of Can@@ ber@@ ra when a long lasting element to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ versy around &#91; C@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think Nick has managed to get the ascension which people like Feder@@ er and Murray does . he asc@@ ends to the eyes of the public and he deserves to support him , but we try to think him , and it &apos;s best for reas@@ onably priced , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explained Not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary explained the emergency and un@@ lock the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim to stop the flow of migrants .
chaos re@@ acted on the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and the officials responded to indig@@ nation .
the people who had fled from violence , were met for an unknown period in a land strip on the road between the two controls of the countries , and built tents , and settled there .
but fru@@ strations rose to .
when a police helicopter moved on them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and they cried out ins@@ ults towards the Hungarian Stand@@ by police .
some was back from protest food and water .
Serbian Foreign Minister stated that there was &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece will arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ ally damage .
&quot; I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic said in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serb border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nation block at a str@@ atum meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the floo@@ ding Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement was achieved that the EU states would take another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union to discuss the crisis in the continent .
Hungary however did not win its hopes for an early action of Brussels or his neighbors .
the emergency not@@ with@@ held on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to protect the crisis , so they could accelerate the streets of qu@@ int@@ ru@@ al and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along his border to Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants across the country - after having stopped a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisoners are deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the past months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point into the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees in search of a better life , and non @-@ war @-@ refugees that are entitled to protection - a view that strongly in contradiction to other EU states , among them Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight , crossing the border or the dam@@ aging the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) tall z@@ ic to make the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also constitute higher pen@@ alties for condemned human traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; as a result of the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian Government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said Government Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the deployment of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters of Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs daily .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security adviser to Or@@ ban , said the government 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already entering into the country .
they come over by forcing the fence , they are now in custody , and are accused of off@@ ences of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are fast to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossing on Tuesday , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hung@@ arians joined a small office in a metal container , to process the data of people and squee@@ zed a crowd in order to im@@ pose yourself there .
about 20 managed to come up , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants had the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would stay food and water until they may arrive to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in the National Survey
the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gain to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic elec@@ torate in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 per cent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced he is elected president of the presidential Office for 15 percent of the Democratic elec@@ torate of the presidential elec@@ torate .
more than five months before the preliminary elections , most democratic elec@@ tors say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed to which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ t Supp@@ orters are more resistant than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton lost some of demo@@ graphic groups in a series of demo@@ graphic groups .
Clinton is holding a big advantage in women and women , but these jumps have decreased .
your support for men has fallen significantly , and S@@ anders are just with@@ drawing with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage of democratic elec@@ tors under 50 years has reli@@ ed , and they are now at the same height now .
however , Clinton had a big advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton had a second @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic elec@@ torate in the general election would say that they would support the Clinton &apos;s enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them by some , and another 15 per cent would only support them because it is the can@@ did@@ acy .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising , that Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters are particularly excited about her .
the views are strongly mixed at those who don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter it would will@@ ingly support them .
while 48 percent of democratic elec@@ tors say in the elections that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ t &apos;s supporters is asked in an open question , why they want the candidates that she is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman &apos;s president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned by Clin@@ t &apos;s Bill Clinton .
consent to dealing with problems and the voters are also cited .
since the vice president is considering a potential for the Presi@@ dential Office in the Wa@@ ag@@ shell , 57 percent of the Democratic voters will see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it .
if the elections of the pre@@ elections are asked who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is on top .
by Clin@@ t &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders &apos; second choice .
opt for Bi@@ den not to can@@ di@@ fy the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s margin increased from 20 points in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic elec@@ tors see Clinton as a can@@ did@@ acy with the best chances to win the choice ; however , this figure has fallen by 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ fis@@ hness &quot; has risen .
however , in the question of what is more important at a candidate , the voters call questions about voters .
similarly as last month , none of the only democr@@ at@@ onic candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate is un@@ acceptable to this elec@@ torate .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates take good results with some important features in elec@@ tors in the elections of their party .
maj@@ orities present Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that more than S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion about him .
Democratic voters of the preliminary elections are generally able to see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continued during the ten@@ ure as Secretary of State , most of the Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions did not affect them .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are not satisfied with their explanation , whereas only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the E @-@ mail contro@@ versy did not have any effect on their general opinions of Clinton , while 36 percent said that their opinion is wor@@ sen@@ ed from her .
they are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views were worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ing bur@@ dened
almost two years after a student died during a cha@@ ik@@ ous rit@@ ual , as a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ ja is filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood captured Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction rit@@ ual when in September 2013 was brutal and delayed its transport to the hospital , which led to his death , distributed the police .
civil servants said he had been bur@@ dened with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound pack full of sand , and repe@@ ats , while he tried to pursue a frozen field on a goal .
finally Mr. Den@@ g mour@@ ned over heada@@ ches , and then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta P@@ si bro@@ therhood call not the call number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing to contact his symptoms of goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , the Brotherhood President of the Brotherhood , to bring advice , and said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood began to hide and put the well the bro@@ therhood of the Brotherhood about the &quot; Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said the Poli@@ mark Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning by his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt strength to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Muslim Brotherhood . at least one student died every year in the Sch@@ ik@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members need to be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for murder of the third order for the first five members .
thirty @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with anti @-@ inflammatory attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to make individuals responsible , but if there is an organization that has - officially or un@@ official - this has to draw these things , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College was banned the Brotherhood , and the Brotherhood &apos;s national Brotherhood has resi@@ sted its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an interest rate hike will come , and the house will reach the wan@@ ing , R@@ end@@ ites for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know how long will it take and how long it will hold .
in particular , the history for the economy has only a small guide to the exp@@ ir@@ ation .
a recession came in within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in which the economy and financial investments react .
hence , representatives of the US central bank have strongly emphas@@ ized that investors have not concentr@@ ating on it when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period , which is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a part .
at the end , market participants may determine that the whole excitement was exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is in@@ so@@ ared by some as a signal to the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still on a low level to deal with the seis@@ mic shock that seem to seem to fear many .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based look on how some areas of business could react :
as the market has seen last month , interest rate hike can be vol@@ ati@@ l for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency to rise for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which is perhaps again reflected in the monetary policy of monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study what is happening after interest rates of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , fairly flat in the 250 days after a current analysis , which published Bob D@@ oll , boss station strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s asset management .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to be compared later on the enh@@ ancing cycle and the return on sales begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate hits them often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed confron@@ ts some conditions that could not exist before and that could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is in the vicinity of its lowest point in an interest rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 rate of interest rate since 1950 was only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , these are just few that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter following the sales of Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest rates in such frag@@ ile economic conditions could be ris@@ ky and dis@@ card the question , &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have taken the whole year on an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were judged to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could cause an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all of the enh@@ ancing cycles of 1950 to date in a super cycle with increasing vibrations in GDP had taken place and before rec@@ ited protection very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shadow , &quot; says the report .
by contrast , this is a very slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is so far 74 months .
fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , as the market increase an interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect is bonds faster than in shares when they change its strategic course .
when bonds , R@@ end@@ ites seem to change direction once the first increase / reduction in the cycle .
at the end of the enh@@ ancing cycle , the investors fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist by Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in the interest rates will lead to result in ranks between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a de@@ fl@@ ing of the curve .
highly @-@ interest bonds often produce better income in such climate although &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come @-@ An@@ al@@ yst@@ in at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
interest@@ ingly , Jones said that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adjusted to the view of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest have increased , the cost curves have increased , and the vol@@ atility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that ab@@ duct the greater part of their business activity in the US will benefit if interest rates are rising and more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts are worse , as an increase of dollars will make their products on the global market more expensive and the financing of their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares incl@@ ined to respond exceedingly positive three months after an initial interest rate hike , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs analysts at a report for the customers .
companies with strong balance sheet of companies increased by 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital pensions and low vol@@ atility at their shares also over@@ met their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt become a major problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest are losing interest , Gold@@ man said .
outside of the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from increasing the dollar .
as@@ par@@ ables can see profits through higher yields , even if experts are in different opinion , how fast this will happen .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
the con@@ serv@@ atives critic@@ ised the caster critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster for his &quot; negle@@ ct &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not being used increasingly from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
S @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins The programme uses The Voice to and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 , &quot; turns into Classic FM , claims a leading par@@ liament@@ arian board and increases new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does not do something that will not do the television .
the con@@ serv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the publicly @-@ legal radio station , &quot; ev@@ um@@ ing &quot; and increasingly do not be able to distinguish it from its commercial competitors .
radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dam@@ s &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seems to be only under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spont@@ aneously the examples in which you actually want to quote what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far off his commercial compet@@ itor when it comes to the public at live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really is uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and put new works on behalf , I really hold for importance , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder it to be worked to engage the audience , as it did in the past because the British are less about classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport , came under fire , the commercial rival to reti@@ re .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins The Voice to - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , got the musical talent show at the BBC , who was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Richter - was produced in a special BBC mode .
he added , he wishes to find the company &quot; a hit from our house stable , &quot; when it starts the next time a entertainment series .
but , however , he refused to exclu@@ de further orders from The Voice to the future , or give money to the fans for other entertainment formats .
net sales rose in August at slow@@ est and black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to the shopping
experts believe that Black Friday lost their editions in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has bo@@ arded , and many of the UK &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into spirit cities .
yet experts say that there are now signs that the online sales have stag@@ n@@ ating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
for August , total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there are evidence that online sales have stag@@ n@@ ating after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he declared that the online sales began three years ago , when purch@@ aser began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , such as at home on the sofa .
but now we comm@@ utes that , and we may probably experience that growth is decreased .
the Black Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the after@@ math turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites have been stor@@ med .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers had stri@@ pped for bar@@ gains , buyers can stop them .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 is spent a little more than 1 £ online .
with some products such as TV and laundry , more than one @-@ third of the purchases must now be performed via web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people &apos;s clothing and shoes buy online rather than in the fashion chains .

Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already promised to continue the p@@ add@@ in to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to be transferred to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group would not have been standing the arm of the crane , when he was not used .

B &amp; Q Boss says that time of cheap East European cra@@ ft@@ men is over
British workers increasingly employ craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe declined an increase
this brings together 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at art@@ is@@ ans
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q will take sales nationwide
Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Br@@ its have set their h@@ ammers and brush in favor of the use of qualified @-@ European tra@@ des@@ people who carry out work in their home
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful to deal with a hammer or a brush to the pin of walls , these days apparently belong to a minority .
because British do increasingly employ people to perform DIY jobs in their homes , as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree @-@ gra@@ ined chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , which offer services for low prices , is now out@@ dated .
thus , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open a 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix shop , which set up a work@@ man and 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight of ten buy @-@ decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment they weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to set up the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single @-@ households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this faster to a balance .
basically , half of our customers consists of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in decision making .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of the leading companies only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also changed their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company which has occupied just 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - great diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and par@@ agra@@ phs after the group &apos;s costs for the closing of the stores .
due to the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open up to 200 new branches .
I / DO@@ B function@@ aries for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two officials from Austria &apos;s volleyball tournament will have to be responsible for un@@ faith@@ fully and public pro@@ curement .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with counter@@ parts .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , had cryst@@ all@@ ised in the preliminary investigation , that the accused were allowed to disp@@ ose of club meetings in the years 2006 to 2011 , about which they were allowed to don@@ ate for private purposes .
he claimed the damage with about 400,000 euros .
sporting activities are also charged with financial aid .
the fact that the Chairman of the Council of the Council , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , retired from this fact .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represents that the association had not been a possession of the property .
the sports officials had only been b@@ illed and the sports club , for which it worked from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money , made from the debt - the liabilities amounted to some 600,000 pounds ( roughly 4@@ 4,000 euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; back then we were in front of the situation : do we keep the club further or lock we ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ professi@@ ons of the financial sector .
he then decided to take this task in his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shed money , laid out our life insurance as security at the Bank , &quot; he said in attendance .
be agreed with the association : you can manage the money in free , no debt must be made .
moreover , as far as possible financial - the payout to the allowance demand had been adopted retro@@ spec@@ tively by 1991 .
therefore , a part of the allowance is only years later , that from 2003 , when an increase has been on the account .
as a result , l@@ ump and non @-@ detail reviews seemed to explain the former ob@@ sol@@ es .
the accounts and savings transferred the two def@@ endants in common , the second def@@ endant said .
why the payments had not been revealed in detail , the judge asked .
the association is not interested in detail for financial markets , is important to only pay the freedom of debt , such as the answer .
in 2011 , when a function@@ ary investigations had started against a function@@ ary investigation , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was referred to the association onto the association .
those were back , the def@@ endants appeared .
this securities account expired , in the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
the in@@ quired long did not know an answer .
then he thought it was saying that this was the best for the club .
if something happens , no one would have known anything from this money , the public prosecutor in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed of the function@@ ary .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; damages . &quot;
why dam@@ aging services ? , judges and prosec@@ uting attor@@ ney know .
the first def@@ endant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , since the club has never been a harm .
but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; You are all of the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; am I a representative ? &quot; he asked .
moreover , he said the function@@ ary , he never related a p@@ enny of salary , he counts only kilometres money and di@@ ets .
in Di@@ ets he charged € 1,000 a month in charge , but the real effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the def@@ endants .
these have been evaluated according to an operational examination , in which everything was judged correctly , no longer declared they declared .
o@@ eing bills also included the second def@@ endant .
all charges are in cash , and he must drive from his place for international law to the Bank in Abi@@ burg , he stated in his statement .
the trial began on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for US banknotes
the world observed , if the US @-@ bank bank is coming to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision , for the first time since almost a decade the interest will be raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reuters , found out that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this now and interest rates will remain at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may assume the zero @-@ area and a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Executive Emplo@@ ye@@ es at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is based on a relatively good power level , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less@@ er perspective on global conditions .
she warned the markets , changing to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds are good against such a step .
the decision was to be announced at 20.00 o CET on Thursday
kill of Death at the Delta State University
after the shooting and killing of his girl@@ friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague , Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; I &apos;m sorry about the first murder and wanted it , &quot; he could not do it , &quot; gave the authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social scientific education at Delta State University , proclaimed the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , he shot at someone , and killed anyone .
in addition , the staff said to the staff , the police had to send police officers to his home .
he said , &quot; I shot my wife last night , &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; would be in the house but won &apos;t be excited , &quot; but probably excited .
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he was not giving him .
lamb was no explanation for his kis@@ ses .
when police operated the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note of Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to do it .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , some 300 miles to Delta State University where he led E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing some of his own life on Monday night when police cont@@ ended him .
President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knows nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course , there was something in Mr Lam@@ p Ide@@ a . &quot;
in spite of the reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , &quot; There is no information , no evidence &quot; for an &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was written by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were eliminated 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the floor . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had his daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ un@@ ition , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les
the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lamb executed his car on side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a Ph.@@ D. in Spring 2015 from the Delta State University as his office is available at the University &apos;s website .

Luke Shaw by Manchester United can &apos;t play for months of double Fra@@ ktur
after the Champions @-@ League defeat in Manchester , Luke Shaw suffered a double repet@@ cture of his right bass at the PS@@ V Eindhoven .
while having taken the left eye defense to the crying , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Shaw can play again in this season for at least six months of play .
the injury caused by a decl@@ aring attack of H@@ é@@ v Mor@@ eno , in the 15th minute , after the 20 year @-@ old Shaw was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg area and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he then moved to the morning or maybe one day later , then in Manchester operates .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy that comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard to play , and then is happening .
in the cabin he had an oxygen screen .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double bond , then takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the hanging of a penalty .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al believed that Italian arbit@@ rators had v@@ ast@@ er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty and a red card had arrived .
it was a very bad attack against both legs .
a prayer to Sha@@ ws account had : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken i am , my way to recovery now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
News Rel@@ ated : Manchester United has the loss of Luke Shaw with the defeat at the PS@@ V
the England defence team has an additional inc@@ entive for the European Championship in France to recover up to the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves out this way of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to harm an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; Coc@@ u said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was going on in another direction , so it looked like if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad . I feel so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also brought to the hospital - after a oul@@ ash by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost .
unless you &apos;re David Cameron .
when he was asked about a provider of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book was asked , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , who appeared in 1971 with Dr. Se@@ uss published in 1971 .
it was a difficult election , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , for it seems to have a picture or a message that we have missed . &quot;
all nice and well , except that the next paragraph appeared in Cameron speaking the action of the book , instead , a summary of the movie version of 2012 , added to the new characters and details added to enlarge the quite short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , to see the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , ful@@ fil@@ s her desire to see a real tree . &quot; a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage had died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it would not be susp@@ icious enough : the text of Cameron referred to as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of the internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he wants to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the local environment through the dg@@ ings , trees fal@@ sely , Th@@ urg@@ atory Once @-@ ler , despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a flowing , car@@ ing @-@ bear@@ ded nature , &quot; which is named in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a helper that the Lor@@ ax did not read 20 times succ@@ essively a child .
a Do@@ wning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text should probably come from Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s electoral system .
super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons was delivered , but there was no other direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was very threatened by the expul@@ sion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult .
it is a difficult task on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you selected the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclu@@ de a victory victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but the joint spirit is strong ; they will bear no sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a young @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on the test level , it is an option for the attack .
here @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th emerg@@ es from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his principal trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that thr@@ ott@@ et@@ eer are aimed at results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , since - and I said this - players their own best choices .
long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
when he hits New York &apos;s Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not give up so good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is especially a team man .
the question how much time a test @-@ stroke rate gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - how Sam Rob@@ son got before him - while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine got .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to do home@@ use and backward .
the only accus@@ ation that could rise was that England first put down Jonathan Tr@@ oon in the C@@ ari@@ bean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he is a b@@ ats@@ man that I do highly .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer - what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he hit us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those who get before him , but it depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to propose Mo@@ een beside Cook , which would bring a Extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and received four qu@@ icks , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a bu@@ zz can not strike there , and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ l of Cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een might have not been his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is not a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before he re@@ joined as Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns straight away and was not looking back .
Z@@ afar W@@ ari enters in the ca@@ des as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling , he was very impressed with him as a young man .
people may see its statistics on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup don@@ ors who collect their hands and the train@@ ers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a couple of smart supplements for coaching .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , which will bring an abundance of experience since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can fresh air in the changing @-@ cabin , even when the messages are in line with the previously said .
coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was given a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team companies do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not taken in a slight heart .
the Bre@@ xit in Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = Great Britain out of the EU ) could be ad@@ missible when the economy is entering a raft unit up to 2017 .
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ released new negoti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU by day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy &quot; is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ently disin@@ t@@ egr@@ ate in Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ms .
a European diplom@@ at trusted that some member states , so deep stri@@ pped into various crises such as the EU now is and not always from their own guilt , Britain himself created the agenda with mir@@ ro@@ wed conc@@ essions and trou@@ bles@@ ome contract changes , which they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it doesn &apos;t like it , if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance : climb to the summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wants to be outside the United Kingdom inside the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes - &quot; L@@ ass does not leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and that the more and more short @-@ term ministers and officials have come to the point where no matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it did in the exagger@@ ated long out@@ breaks like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look at his re @-@ election or replacement for 2017 .
it is also an ob@@ bl@@ ending force .
Poland may soon become a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a le@@ ft@@ ist .
it is hard to imagine that they will be able to pl@@ uck up a leg in order to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , to prevent the withdrawal from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most of them have separ@@ at@@ ist ten@@ dencies .
hence , some such ministers also plan un@@ intenti@@ onally disappointed notes , all in the SN@@ P style , while British referendum in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ dge &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how rac@@ et@@ ish the Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense and which EU scep@@ tics may not be the Oli@@ gar@@ chie of the press bar@@ ons , as it did not were during the time Tony Ben@@ n inspired by our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you may remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro Opp@@ ort@@ uni@@ sten , who made themselves a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his displacement , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
for this purpose , the Med@@ ley was of tax @-@ for@@ ce@@ able jack@@ ets , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ in@@ foreigners that possess most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about it , but thought that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas to wi@@ pe him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself , when he turned out a referendum on the non @-@ approved Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch elec@@ tors in 2005 , which opened to him a door door opened .
press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly little can@@ ola on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer need time for me - seems to repeat , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yc@@ ott Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , a mistake at that time and today .
it may last but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe is - I &apos;ll put it kind of time - in the development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ale trend and the wild fil@@ ets of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ English can probably tell everyone to say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said , when the sc@@ out of the prov@@ oking of John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow anz@@ ler was a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father vent@@ ured on television to be opposed to his Labour Cab@@ inet Director that will lose too far and lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys Battle was even more attractive .
but to fight , to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell told , nor what J@@ C told his comra@@ des and members after all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n will communicate - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the Stru@@ del of the Social Media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right , Cameron doesn &apos;t give a ticket to Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the presentation campaign as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell told it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental recent am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to the EU membership - in line with her Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ts Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past , is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sidents , for which the nar@@ c@@ ism of the small difference is a central base of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to Nato &apos;s Tom Wat@@ son , J@@ C does not launch a campaign to the outlet , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense of superior home .
why should Paris or Berlin reject political capital - they have also susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ?
the U.S. is quite disappointed in the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government on the power of which I was remin@@ ded by a bit remin@@ ded by the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK Report about E @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined the Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ise the methods used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month , describing him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have put the loading capacity of the data and indicates the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily base basis &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the alleg@@ ations made &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Relations Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of its effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful as smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement consists of a single meeting of 12 people who were called to create a model for an additional criteria ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine products ; the results of the meeting were conden@@ sed into a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose manager had previously received from British American Tob@@ acco ( B@@ AT ) for an independent trial .
he also wrote testim@@ oni@@ als from B@@ AT to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated on the meetings will receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes supplier , but not the financing , which he should have received after reports of the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee will not be delivered , but there are several known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide an industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco line from P@@ he also participated in the meeting .
the research work of the group &quot; stands in indic@@ ative that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for most of the products &quot; on most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , there will be no such connections or limitations in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the alleg@@ ations of P@@ he said &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking &quot; were past .
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that on the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J had already responded before .
he said , &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison must be low , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique duty to information about the public about what evidence shows and what not , especially if there are much public confusion about relative risks in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system € two billion a year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking caused by smoking we meet our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , former chief of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ l@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio amount should only be used to do the type of programs that are not broadcast through other UK broad@@ caster .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they may be seen public @-@ legal programmes that could probably be seen by a smaller audience , in hard disputed tim@@ eline for the most popular shows of their Riv@@ age and sen@@ ders as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success with the BBC in contact with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs can be commissioned or send them clearly by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his research on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the radio fee , what I want to do middle or long term for a good idea , one should make his production at least on programs that do not make or commission .
they send The Voice to a top @-@ class schedule because they want to achieve a wide support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show it is a joke , it is ridic@@ ulous , it is naturally non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a rainy tax was financed , which may also be financed without subsidi@@ zation .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ l@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
I stri@@ ve to see how this will be public @-@ speaking television .
I don &apos;t think that this would make the BBC anyway .
Johnson , a business@@ man for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence is on the hunt for reviews , &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart &apos;s lecture at Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC was to sell as East@@ l@@ ders .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal agen@@ ic programs can go to BB@@ C4 where you cannot measure their duties , but they may carry out their tasks , and they may argue that they have created all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programs , &quot; Well , of course , we have seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window , in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
for the broadcast charge , Johnson said the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather rainy system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value .
of course , you think we all think you get a great value for £ 150 each year , but for those who for the 150 £ a lot of money is , ask me whether that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday said that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educ@@ ate and chat . &quot;
he said , only little of the BBC production now would have been officially classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take such an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , clari@@ fy and chat . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC , should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful in television are shown , and with the commercial Sen@@ ales Alli@@ ances go online to make everything online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etic &quot; can control brain cells by sound waves
video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des will change direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound imp@@ ul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified systems systems that can be controlled by ou@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the right , in which they have to be heard with sound imp@@ ul@@ ses , which are to be heard for the human hearing .
the imp@@ ul@@ ses are due to the inser@@ tion of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells which are genetically modified to react to the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asound waves .
further on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said , the worms revealed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ ogen@@ us , in which ultr@@ asound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ ing@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the trial of one day could replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , an invas@@ ive procedure which gives an electric imp@@ ul@@ ses in the brain of treating Parkinson &apos;s disease .
F@@ aden@@ worms react usually not on ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani pointed out that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , rein@@ force ultr@@ asound waves , which are then penet@@ rating the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asound le@@ fts work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the sausages .
the sound waves are pushing the opening of these icons , and activate the cells that are associated with , such a journal Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled I@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ ions are TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
if it conver@@ ts ultr@@ asound to changing creatures , the sound waves are intensi@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transfer into worms , where they switch the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has a number of simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to input and expand neur@@ ons with imp@@ ul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ us could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic waves may occur , and can be sent into the brain from top on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily control the targeted human neur@@ ons in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in halls
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence , but still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the ten@@ der@@ ful smile of those who I stum@@ bled - and to the numerous , long @-@ vo@@ iced complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the move in student dormitories ranging from light to light @-@ descri@@ b@@ able up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to che@@ ating people : tell you where you come from whether and where you have had the Sabbath year , where you don &apos;t love anything else to Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you have &quot; hon@@ estly don &apos;t love anything , &quot; because seriously , guys , it &apos;s just one yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it l@@ ends the interview and helps you to find out the people who like to do in contrast to those who would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes were caught fire and fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people leave .
people of people often turn into beverages , film overnight venues and public squares , but they are also the places where people are attra@@ cting and decor@@ ate their under@@ wear .
referring to : do not remember to start with a relationship with a relationship
intro@@ vert a rough handling department .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship going on , but you have to go away to get the energy back , which I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow fellow is exhausted from soci@@ ability - and send SMS with it instead .
speaking of ank@@ lo@@ ps : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw a few things .
friendship conclu@@ ding with B@@ aking .
since you start the university at the height of Back Man@@ ia , the clo@@ ke is to present themselves with a plate full of bro@@ w@@ ni@@ es , less strange as the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have a bit un@@ pack . so , and now please smile , if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats are a good way to close friends .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates are obliged to enter@@ tain himself , and will be associate with a delicious surprise at the end of the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are an independent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed lot of g@@ um@@ ps from flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping , if you want to anchor .
to steal food is an eph@@ emer@@ al crime in student residence .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is an theft , but is it taking a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea too ?
check it out with the milk owner .
the odds are good , they say to themselves , even if they cook in the inside .
when someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to kill as well as my fellow li@@ fel@@ i@@ fier that added a washing up to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
it is now in prison .
you shouldn &apos;t make any noise , people from sleep or working .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent man , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ ge to humans that sit in the glass .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours , whether it makes them something special , Drum &amp; bass turn somewhat qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more loud music .
when they finally ceased at 5 o &apos;clock , her neighbours had to sleep two hours before leaving their own music , shut down their door and went on to her three hour test .
would it not be romantic , if your future wife would come into being at random in the same student residence ?
the conver@@ sely , it would not be un@@ earth@@ en@@ sely , if you meet a co @-@ hab@@ itation for your future wife partners , to separate themselves and to see them every day , and perhaps will participate , as they have taken away all common friends ?
of course , the heart is taking its own ways - but if a hot fellow country@@ woman is definitely not your future wife partners , try at least to reason your sub@@ sid@@ y a little reason .
at the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has its key in its not closed rooms , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and M@@ ob@@ bing f@@ one as it seems .
a good ride is fun , but it takes only moments when it is a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson over security - but have never lost someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
shut down your door , and put their keys into a glass of water which you will then put in the freezer - but t@@ ack@@ ers her owners at the ceiling no more than twice .
ter@@ raced houses for refugees , all @-@ gath@@ erers , Ger@@ ing@@ ants
the real estate agency Markus Gil@@ dner re@@ builds for people who have not much money in the medi@@ fr@@ en@@ ish Eck@@ ental H@@ ousing Complex .
so for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need living space but as well as the only accommod@@ ating mother and the device operators . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build good and well @-@ build today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview .
thousands of refugees are pushing back to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes in how quickly cheaper living space can be created : it builds on a project ter@@ raced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing back to the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the number of accommodation in containers or gym has no sustainability .
for people stay in a great part here .
in view of the refugee camp , we also need enough living space in the coming decades .
a very basic , three @-@ storey town@@ house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a ter@@ raced house needs a fe@@ west place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
that is different , when people under@@ scores human beings .
each of the six properties built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say , it is peace again , I go back .
then , the houses can be converted easily according to respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
construction took six months .
this is reasonable .
did the construction regulations make your plans difficult ?
Gil@@ dner : I did my project right through my project .
it is always difficult to make the dro@@ p@@ end ladies value special construction and the slot order .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
the apartment is still under way , in which there are three apartments in a ter@@ raced house , needs at least three places .
only in cities there is no space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how have the inhabitants responded to their ter@@ raced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me to create luxury houses for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not correct .
but do not spar@@ se the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have been built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only accommod@@ ating mother or the g@@ ing@@ ants .
I show how to build today &apos;s well @-@ priced and well @-@ built .
this is why it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the New iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be called by clicking on the installation app , click &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; software update . &quot;
when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then to install .
some are encountered after installation , since they receive an error message inform@@ ing that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to get the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush will return or try to update using iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by the closure of the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you submit a special tool to install apps and re @-@ install it once the process is finished .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during updating or , in the proximity of a loading device , so that battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t allow the update being continued , as the phone may switch over half @-@ way and this could lead to a crash of updates .

&quot; clos@@ eness and constant contact to the patient are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss .
and so you agree , the garbage bags bought the house with practice .
they will continue to stay in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there is also two @-@ time family @-@ father Frank Müller too , who followed his medical studies in Hannover at several consultations and in the hospitals in Sul@@ z@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
currently he is working as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ z@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as Senior Physi@@ cian in the Die@@ ph@@ ol@@ z district and is engaged in volunte@@ ering at DR@@ K @-@ willingness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ resi@@ ausen as a dent@@ ist , his wife speci@@ alizes in the gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the garbage cans , both intern@@ als , want to settle down as a house@@ keeper .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after conversion , the rooms look modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ asound tests as well as long @-@ term and durability @-@ EK@@ EN and need a talk room anymore .
moreover , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 euros received the garbage dump in a con@@ veying program of the county ( 25@@ 000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; that shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice continues , &quot; emphas@@ izes Sam@@ man &apos;s mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann .
some 2,000 patients come from Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ or@@ l in every quarter to the practice of Fel@@ resi@@ sting , in the nor@@ theastern Germany there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another house practice .
a positive side effect of the practice of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in the case of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ resi@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor has found , it would have gone .
who visits the litter &apos;s consultation hours , especially in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and det@@ erg@@ ing the cleaning power from the Fel@@ resi@@ sts .
with their farewell in As@@ endorf , there is a era , after all , the medical profession has practic@@ ed 30 years there .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ resi@@ sters ch@@ uck@@ led .
a little mo@@ dest@@ y for@@ gives it after the long time .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and often see many patients often seen , &quot; says the intern .
your husband compl@@ aining : &quot; we have a 6000 square metre plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pressed myself with hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural work , now that could be different . &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees suffer by &quot;
&quot; the border checks are also high on our southern border , &quot; said Minister @-@ Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel .
however , it is clear that anyone who wants an asylum application wants to be &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; of course .
the care and safety of the people stand in the fore@@ ground .
it is clear , however , that it needs significant signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people have to know that we do not accept unlimited mig@@ r@@ ations , not beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs an controlled approach .
Croatia is denied &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would continue to travel in the direction of Austria and Germany , and also er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees under any circumstances .
throughout the way , the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ i@@ bach did not see .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; in Slovenia , much rather the monitoring of the border - particularly to Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
the border with Croatia is as the outer edge of the Schengen area , however , is already controlled .
as the Minister emphas@@ ized , Slovenia has to continue its borders for refugees but not factories .
&quot; each EU member must fill out its obligations ; otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
as the Croatian government reported that the first refugees had already tried in the night hours of Tuesday to arrive at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police arrested them in the near maize fields .
since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , has been constantly meeting with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it was mainly used by Syrians , Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
in the coming days , his country with about 4,000 refugees , Minister of Interior , said Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would participate in the Maced@@ onian Serbian border , which had previously carried out migrants towards the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Belgrade government , however , denied that it is , people who want to take certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; he named it .
according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the city of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were all around the night of the Maced@@ onian border through Serbia around 500 km away .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police said that we should leave here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this might actually be the un@@ fore@@ seen shift in the Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a bit further west of the distance .
Croatia : &quot; extensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatian minister in O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously pointed out that his country for the fall of a strong condition of refugees have prepared the plans for possible exceptional situations .
details he did not see , but he pointed out that Croatia became a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border check@@ ups . &quot;
they lead strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners introduce a good report on the country since then , affecting the standard of border controls .
according to the Hungarian border fence , approximately 300 refugees still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the degree of media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities the two border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to remain completely closed .
if the remaining refugees want to continue travelling to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of Interior Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic had tried every Wednesday early at a local eye note in Hor@@ g@@ os : he stops the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for illegal .
it would currently not take a great number of refugees .
they could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
assist@@ ants coun@@ selling migrants - dangerous - Alternative ro@@ oves
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute the refugees in the refugees , on which alternative routes through Croatia are dra@@ fted .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area there are even 20 years after the conflict there still no more spacious min@@ ef@@ ields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ef@@ ields was sent to the border region .

most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ian Hosp@@ it@@ enti@@ er Feder@@ ated with this action att@@ enti@@ vely attracted to its 20th anniversary and is definitely confron@@ ted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we are with the action in the middle of the city and under the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer .
head of ec@@ umen@@ ical hospitality is available as well as questions and discussions how the volunteers are volunteers .
while managing a password spont@@ aneously to the chal@@ k and to do the sentence by &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop by the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , others continue to read phr@@ ases like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
again on the br@@ ink of small discussions on the action , over life , dealing with dying .
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this represents an effective action of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone wants to put on the tablets a public , but is comprehen@@ sible , finally , it was a very personal cause .
the subject of death and death may be considered before with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the Hosp@@ it@@ ching Movement has contributed much in recent years that people can open .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ earnings Recovery , Financial Outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer giant accounted for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his boat transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers on holiday .
at this time in the past year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 per cent in the pre @-@ market trading and 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year that ends in May , 20 cent less than with the previous forecast .
analysts are expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which will amount to 4.9 percent , and will be effective January 4 , despite the higher volumes for boat transport of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said it nevertheless expect that the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and due to growth in the online trade will increase .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company would consider &quot; solid income if you consider the weaker economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade , into consideration . &quot;
the plans for the holidays employment have been announced a day later than the rival UPS that plans , 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional employees , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just ahead of the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks investment research analysts predic@@ t analysts predicted .
sales rose by 5 percent to EUR 12.@@ 3 billion .
six out of Z@@ acks demanded an expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has achieved a decline in international priority ship@@ ments during the last years , which had stag@@ n@@ ated sales in his unit express mail .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the final quarter sales increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically shallow due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit reported higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher working costs in freight operations .
at the pre@@ market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stocks around 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 per cent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they made 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th .
on the most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist spending two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table seated to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade the console .
threatened by them at an end of the emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story seating sa@@ ils , there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is remin@@ ded that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from the Congress : maxim@@ ise the US @-@ Employment and Prices are stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders recognized that there is a non @-@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision to predic@@ t them to predic@@ t it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the close @-@ term interest rate by the near zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the latest turbul@@ ence might make the most spar@@ c@@ auti@@ ous F@@ ed Representative to join the global financial markets , this vol@@ atility may increase by the interest rate of interest for federal government - and it is also only one quarter point .
&quot; obviously , the labor market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think when searching for a pre@@ text , the interest rate would not increase , increased un@@ certainty around the global market is enough to maintain , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed will do , which deals with itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently surveyed from Bloomberg , have predicted an interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets have a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which indicates a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a decrease in the share market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists lose the blow by making them promise that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average score by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy raised the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would take the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets , so that they are not in panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a interest rate hike would calm the financial markets , because it would work un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed will act .
even before one month the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points to this month , the first small step in a slow pollution of monetary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer that in this year despite the complaints of Liber@@ als , more economic progress would be required to increase the movement .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improvement was solid on the labour market this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full @-@ time activity .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed Representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them because of tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ pru@@ dent .
but the financial markets came together all over the world at the end of the month , after China used its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average Value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down on the Chinese economy would po@@ ste global growth .
the market has recovered something this month , the Dow has now reached nearly 10 % below the High Court .
for the F@@ ed @-@ representatives the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation , when you should increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred in this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US grade point .
now he predic@@ t that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; there are a lot of un@@ certainty in what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; O@@ liner said .
the health of the global economy is none of the main signs of the F@@ ed , therefore they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the former Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could move its mon@@ etric expansion , &quot; dissolved the confusion around the globe .
in a world where economies and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed @-@ Representative can also monitor that they will not only monitor the developments in other locations , but also communicate with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding of global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of over@@ impact on financial market movements , with apparently not associated with economic Fund@@ ament@@ als . &quot;
l@@ acker , voted member of the Federal Open Market Committee , set up for an interest rate hike , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their conduc@@ tion by 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited exposure to growth in the US &quot; said L@@ acker .
one year later the ed @-@ representatives formed this cuts .
the F@@ ed should only set aspects of financial stability during a difficult crisis as the market entry in 2008 , Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee on Bank laying down the Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ence do not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not refer to the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small residents for refugees
more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
preparing them a warm welcome , not without the engagement with a volunteer volunteer .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a number of people who support un@@ profitable asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .

Brazil &apos;s p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric company Rio Grande is promoting food for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy in sho@@ cking ways of women , how important good nutrition is during the breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who are painted on breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give birth to all nutrients which they need to set up a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers will catch their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should be carried out .
a recent study under the management of Robert Water@@ land , professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , un@@ healthy eating of the child may neg@@ atively impact the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof is allowed to fl@@ atter for solar system .
the planning for the long a@@ waited gym@@ nasium at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ campus step forward by step ahead : in the most recent municipal session , the elabor@@ ated construction application has been dis@@ soci@@ ably blessed without a large discussions .
before , the panel , inter alia , had decided to apply for a structural legal &quot; exception &quot; respec@@ tive &quot; liberation &quot; from the valid development plan .
with the exception &quot; exception &quot; it went for a special form to the roof construction .
accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof &quot; should be built with non @-@ quality first and ro@@ ofing . &quot;
background of the planning is the scheduled use of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; as a result , we get a wonder@@ fully large South @-@ roof together , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the &quot; Liberation , &quot; there was again the roof ten@@ ants which should be mandatory for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan - to be below ten degrees .
this will significantly reduce the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof ten@@ sion@@ ing has no &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der municipal at rule seems to be more restri@@ ctive by the case of deliver@@ ances .
but this is no recur@@ ring project in the gym : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the sports centre at the sports centre is a communal project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs amounted to approximately 2.3 million euros .
grants are expected from school and por@@ ridge .
in the next process , the building contract for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre hall is now being submitted to the re@@ mission .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of staff pull from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district court in front of , the Land@@ r@@ ator of Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White confirmed .
a decision about the Supervisory Board , however , announced his decision on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should be moved with fishermen and the continuing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who can not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au may be a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change of the resignation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic only since the beginning of the beginning and now changes to a private practice in close proximity of the hospital .
with the question who should succeed him , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into the game which he declared to take over management and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of 1 October .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , in any case , this is &quot; appreciation &quot; and a distribution of the range of internal medicine , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the interior of gastro@@ enter@@ ology disorders .
over the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board shall agree to both houses , and then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app , which has more than 35 beds , will definitely be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
the administrative district had so far been scheduled to start in 2018 , when the current re@@ development was completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , also Chairman of the Executive Board , has also met rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Federal Court of Germany , is to be used as an accommodation for asylum @-@ moving .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several consider@@ ations .
there are currently a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and an Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry there .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come again , &quot; so Fischer about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , which had been received positively and very understand@@ ably . &quot;
a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has worked as head physician for over 30 years , has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer mates to adopt the post of medical directors .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was always under threat from closure , departments became closed , for example the surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics .
the manual of the Rhein @-@ Neckar Lion are called tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischer HC .
in Wuppertal the table leader of the Bundesliga is available in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for over@@ rides .

Jag@@ ap@@ se with two Ver@@ sions at Pr@@ at@@ au
two Tra@@ ctor ships were severely injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during Aber@@ deen on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( County Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , like the police ha@@ sted .
after a donation , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were put into hospitals .
as precisely it could happen to the accident , first of all was un@@ clear .
the crimin@@ als were identified .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violence crimes
a susp@@ icious has led the police on the dead body of the Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the inter@@ viewer , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was killed , the young people killed and their dead bodies have thrown into a canal in rock @-@ breaks .
since Saturday , 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate have been missing for a violent crime .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , including public prosecutor and police on Wednesday afternoon .
as a result , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old man was suspected of having said the fact that the investigation into the discovery of the ly@@ che led to the discovery of the body .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning after having previously agreed to come home on the eve after a visit of a festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for young women , investig@@ ators were initially looking forward to personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
when question@@ ings in the friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the crimin@@ als resulted in a susp@@ icious against the 20 @-@ year @-@ olds .
the suspected perpet@@ rators brought the police to a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the arrest , the authorities arrested and killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old police and put the bodies in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be pre@@ ten@@ dered to be at@@ on@@ at@@ ched on Wednesday , investig@@ ators put him to death .
in fact , the further investigation is to bring further investigation .
refugees Need : study warns of new homes
the situation on the German residential market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees seek a paid stay .
pressure on the housing market grows .
the social housing building is a challenge .
the distribution events on the German residential market have long started .
with the upcoming refugees and job seeking out of the EU , more people are pushing onto a market that is now over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with platinum @-@ income citizens around the last paid apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 .
the result is a study on behalf of the &quot; social housing construction &quot; on behalf of the consortium . &quot;
in comparison , 260@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
this way 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated after the first three months of their stay , as asylum seek@@ ers live in an initial exceptional accommodation .
many will stum@@ ble on the housing market and lined up in the long qu@@ eu@@ es before the rental apartments .
according to Stati@@ st@@ isches Bundes@@ amt , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only rising to the rising number of refugees .
the study also accounts significant changes in residential buildings from the last years .
Germany sh@@ it a residential area , which is greater by year to year .
at present , Matthias Günther , author of the study , is currently missing in the metro@@ politan areas .
many professional people lived in major cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly longer in &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; for the flute market .
in the major cities the number of square metres per capita has fallen back in the last years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing construction &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to boost social housing again .
thus , the property tax will be wa@@ ive , and the property tax for funded apartments may be suspended .
according to the Alliance , additional control options are required according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for refugee camps of the State Bank Kf@@ W already exists well in cities and communities .
a good week after the start was Monday evening , with 184 million euros , more than half of which have been available for around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free to@@ wing : Croatia and Slovenia their corridor
after Hungary , practically no transition occurs , there are always more refugees in the way over Croatia .
Zagreb announces the way through Slovenia to the North , without the obstacles to the north .
nevertheless the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ e Internal Minister and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ Land Croatia is still no Schengen area .
after the de@@ priv@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people have come over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RTL .
Hungary had sealed its limit for Refu@@ ge@@ es on the day .
new laws , which came into effect on the same day , is practically unnecessary to do this ri@@ p@@ tive asylum procedure in Hungary .
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic explained : &quot; you can travel through , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
people , however , are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police seized the first refugees in the Serbian border of Serbia in the morning .
most of them are reported to report media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as taxis to the Serbian Border Area S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they tried to walk on the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serb border the refugees aren &apos;t f@@ ences at mar@@ g@@ inal f@@ ences .
the border deals with other dangers : there are sharp mines in the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ef@@ ields should now quickly create a secure passage .
however , after closing the border , no more refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police had 3@@ 66 orders .
just before the door on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws , the over@@ coming and damage of the Grenz@@ en@@ a@@ uns as perpet@@ rators .
35 prisoners were thus initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years as well as deportation to five years and the deportation of the country .
according to information from immigration authorities , a total of 94 applications were accepted in the newly developed &quot; tran@@ se@@ ons &quot; of 94 applications , including nearly all - 93 - the most important part of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two older people were born .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees had left there .
but virtually no one has a view to granted asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
just a few hundred refugees were gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s &quot; tran@@ se@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers started to get back .
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish one of left the tens of thousands of people in the streets last weeks .
blocking lat@@ ti@@ ces have been cut down and one of the shooting camp located in the border area was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself to the goal of this expansion .
Austria , after closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only few refugees .
the country has intensi@@ fied its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants were still present in the country .
in Salzburg , some 1,@@ 400 people wait for the drive to Germany .
there was stopped by train from Germany to the German authorities on the morning .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
Mayor stepped &quot; Gest@@ ure &quot; on the fron@@ tier
&quot; we were busy after the bridge firm on Sunday with the living rooms , when suddenly ten people stood with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; so W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins was the mayor of Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had surprisingly decided on Sunday because of the refugee traffic with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein finished , &quot; so Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and the cars crossed the border to the Na@@ he Pass@@ au .
previously we have to sell the un@@ wanted guests at once , with a snack and drink .
we said the same , we bring them to Pass@@ au with the car .
&quot; this was self @-@ evident &quot; as Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N talk .
they were very grateful .
a man did not take it to hand a generous donation - € 100 for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this is very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the stran@@ ded train passengers increased on Sunday night in W@@ els from a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to follow the fact that the railway traffic was adjusted to Germany , but still attempt to try over the border .
but the regional train was removed before the border of W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge firm with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday was festive , day before a two mosquito trap - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
so , that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án are now sending thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of apparent policy :
instead of help in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp , human@@ ity ensure that human@@ ity has officially ensured that human@@ ity has un@@ official and openly translated the attitude of the Hungarian Government in the Dun@@ es of National Soci@@ alism .
suffering from this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confron@@ ted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
they also have to discover that the &quot; yel@@ low@@ ly country , &quot; that they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp .
it will be a great challenge , in view of the persistent flows and the coming Win@@ ters , to establish a decent condition for protective seek@@ ers .
and there will be another larger , peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35,000 winter@@ ly Qu@@ arti@@ facts
Konrad has filled all hands to the refugee , with the refugees .
Christian Konrad is it acc@@ ust@@ omed to have his word weight .
the Government used the earlier power Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set quot@@ ations for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the start @-@ up centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Konrad has already received the grip .
&quot; we have no homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported his first success .
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday had come to Austria , said Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; master performance . &quot;
according to the Ministry of the Interior , &quot; von &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a need of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ arti@@ facts in the he@@ ur@@ igen year .
in order to meet the number in the coming weeks , 35,000 apartments have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should prepare the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without the ground , &quot; Konrad .
he has already held talks with the regional headquarters .
these had added to him , even to create quot@@ ations for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it goes well , &quot; Ferry Ma@@ ier said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ate is supported by Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Be@@ born , there will be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations are the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator to the ORF @-@ Action &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot;
on the platform private individuals can offer simple accommodations .
in addition , one hopes to stay empty in the winter .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier yesterday released the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emer@@ gen@@ cies , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must have a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the finishing .
for a temporary period of time , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would apply .
Konrad with his experience , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , Konrad was justified with his experience .
I am an elderly man , who is not yet telling the un@@ tru@@ ths .
the persu@@ as@@ ion force is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier cause the republic to cause no cost as they themselves declared .
their employees want to increase them to four to four .
the own qu@@ art search has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz requires a better distribution
no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary for those affected by those affected by these measures , says mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , further sites are due to be checked on their de@@ w@@ th@@ fulness .
critic@@ isms of the city leaders in the distribution of refugees within the country .
other districts have also to contribute their contribution .
hofer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a long phone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday passes further proposals in the refugee question .
See@@ hofer gave me as@@ sures that the German borders are not sealed .
the continued journey of refugees in the FR@@ G would continue to be possible .
however , there is now the corresponding limit controls .
special trains with refugees after Germany will not give it any more .
the protection seek@@ ers would however be brought with regular trains to Germany .
for the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ ehr@@ inger requested more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question .
however , that Austria once again leads to controls over its borders , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger is a logical consequence &quot; from the action of Germans .
the next Run@@ ta@@ stic is a matter of time
the general restoration of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industry bar is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the stock company S &amp; T is drawn , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) should be rented out to young , innovative companies from the technology range .
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try they are working for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the New ship@@ yard , and later also to acc@@ ede .
starting from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - what is the fact that Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promises : &quot; the next Run@@ ta@@ stic is just a matter of time . &quot;
at 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ center , which belongs to a third of the City of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is at Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
about 30 percent of the 2700 square metres of resi@@ dual surface in the building are already rented , for an additional 40 per cent there will be qu@@ eries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the arcade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are central .
in reality , Jut@@ ta Bre@@ it wanted to state a dog .
this project had to push the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni at the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , it has now gained some growth in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business , in which it sells bags , suitcase , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything is now about ladies &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are down from 75 euros .
large bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop is open since yesterday .
he was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; but I have taken a long time , whether I should open a shop , &quot; says Bre@@ it .
the decision was decisive for the decision , among other things , also the Fur@@ la producers , which are at home in Bologna , had been sold from the idea of a personal site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the large area of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters that even made Italian roots .
her fashion interest has made Bre@@ it of her mother into the cra@@ dle .
I stum@@ bled at most , when something develops and I can show new trends in high @-@ performance prices .
why some woman gaz@@ ing at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can also answer the woman &apos;s conc@@ ub@@ ine .
maybe it &apos;s the reason that a beautiful bag is utilized every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher in K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump arrived from a place called its inhabitants .
this property links some of the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for a f@@ uss .
whether he di@@ lig@@ ently expresses foreign host@@ ile , journalist or knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential campaign was for@@ ging the campaign .
and cuts up well .
it is also registered in the pf@@ enn@@ ese town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate genes come from .
the New Yor@@ kers with the F@@ ish@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a not@@ ch in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the Wine Road .
maneu@@ ver in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to -@@ zig corners with him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think you &apos;ll find that somehow exciting , but in their K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter kind could not be so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native of K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed a am@@ using documentary on the place and its famous spr@@ inkl@@ ers , among which tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ a .
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the hearts .
indeed , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ds to believe that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit of la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ y@@ stadt within a circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - leads to a flood : the investors , she says .
the Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of An@@ ders .
the Com@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the last grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers .
the corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate company was first in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents were not free of tragedy : your wish to return to the homeland , failed on the Bavarian state to which the Palat@@ inate was then belonged .
he did not receive the ump , because he once had been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute of She@@ et &apos;s History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , had declared a film release .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
that is in contrast to the mit@@ ochondri@@ al statements of the follow @-@ up .
he had repeatedly spoken over Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to ref@@ resh illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ arity , this is not so pleasant , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote @-@ born tr@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born . &quot; ) .
the win@@ eg@@ ro@@ wer in retired sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so big . &quot;
do he believe Tr@@ ump comes from ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never looked after K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension administrator in Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm menti@@ ons as many K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter stated that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz came to a visit to the church organ which was generally well approached .
&quot; that can &apos;t I imagine the Donald &apos;s , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
you find it better if he didn &apos;t know the election , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
if those who had the age at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like he would have never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting threads than him , &quot; says Win@@ shred@@ ders Sarah Bü@@ hler .
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
Wend@@ ell &apos;s film , inter@@ viewed for the Com@@ ump @-@ long , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ nis@@ ed , even in the US awak@@ ens the interest .
the Upper Bavaria municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hand of Vice President during the German Alps club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park was awarded the award for gentle tourism .
there are already 20 &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ d@@ ör@@ fer in Austria . &quot;
in neighbouring country , the local alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; must have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be exp@@ elled as a protective zone .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to adopt the loss of leadership in the Today Show .
Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson face to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but it has no major shifts in Today &apos;s reviews .
the breakfast show from Nine was aired by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the host David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ ths , stuck in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this dis@@ advantage of the resistance seemed to play any role for Australian TV viewers as Sun@@ rise aver@@ aged 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities compared to Today 33@@ ,000 .
today , Today launched a slight increase in the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number stayed behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3.000 ) .
today in recent months , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August , Today finally reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 went .
up to date , Sun@@ rise has reached an average of 34@@ 9,000 spectators at Today &apos;s 3@@ 14@@ ,000 spectators Today .
that is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of the mur@@ al affect this morning more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Vol@@ to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thomson .
the new drama on a recently wi@@ ou@@ wed father , who decided to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics had asked whether Thomson could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answers this with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; .
the X @-@ Factor from Seven stayed strongly with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and beat slightly The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 ) is the new qui@@ z @-@ show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe , on average , 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour was achieved by The Chase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .

the last three voices are : Bachelor of Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets unveiled ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may seem un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly obvious who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , who has finally landed at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was in largest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give , whether they are the one who received the last rose .
but when we go with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows in the day before going into three two , you possibly acci@@ dentally granted a note on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood sealed his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have left ly@@ rical ways , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense for hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as a reason why they like to be his partner .
however , when the question is asked , &quot; If you don &apos;t know who was to receive the last Rose &apos;s last Rose ? &quot; you could kill their answers to the game &apos;s heart .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them both fast - except itself - Mack@@ ay as best partner in Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship between the first day of the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I thought that in the whole course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
Sarah is standing with both feet on the ground , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that they and Sam wood would be well suited as a pair .
from their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that during the last week you made clear that Wood &quot; to be one . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I posted on him now , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked to choose who Wood should choose , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love those remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is held on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed a great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent out en@@ quiries about their stunning event at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some co@@ als would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a rum@@ ble as it was the Aussie Rug@@ by league conver@@ sions on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t @-@ return and even in the running game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the dressing cabin after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies to grin@@ d the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula reinforced Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ sman Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ hey , who advised him to forget his pat@@ rolled catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is playing at a Pun@@ t that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vik@@ ings .
certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian dealer for his N@@ FL debut had been hoping for .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble curse the playing field and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could imagine no worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; this was a thing that comes now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .
Hay@@ ne made his debut with his original debut at the time in 2007 when a passport led to a T@@ ry for Queensland , in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

4 people killed after police officers shoot at protest@@ ers in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal , after the police fired Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de as a result of the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Bis@@ hn@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Executive officials , said that more than 1,000 protest@@ ers gathered outside a police station , some of whom threw stones and fire@@ bomb .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and shot up into the air before returning to Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de .
20 police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not clear why the rub@@ ber@@ nac@@ ul@@ ls are used , of which it is known that they can kill , but traditionally used as less le@@ thal alternative , obviously produced a high mortality rate .
the debate was the last in weeks non@@ violent protest in Nepal as southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ri@@ i say that new provinces are made in the framework of the proposed new constitution , would decrease their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that wants to have one &apos;s own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were killed in violent conflicts since the 10th century .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement signed the country in provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that was governed by centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature broke out this week via certain cl@@ auses in the Constitu@@ ent design in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes due to weight loss surgery live longer than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery which has a leading article to the new study of J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss of loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to minim@@ ize the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and lim@@ iting the body &apos;s own ability to record food .
about the years Adi@@ pos@@ itas operations were proved in@@ efficiently for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who have been ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of over 30 are regarded as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compar@@ ing two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach acid formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes for people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI among those who underwent this operation fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
the BMI of those who were non @-@ surgical treatments were approximately equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ go surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was completely dissolved and at 28 % in part .
in contrast to the medic@@ ally @-@ treated group , diabetes dissolved just one percent in comparison with the type of diabetes and at least two percent .
in addition , results of blood pressure , tri@@ glyceri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also over@@ saw the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers are writing .
after the operation the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - does not slow the mortality in five years , as the principal researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger returns in BMI ( 7.4 versus 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ wave of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years , there is evidence of a study of severe people in Sweden , that surgery will lead to a longer lifetime , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was subjected to obesity affected by overweight people who underwent a reduction of obesity - about 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that sought conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soo@@ thing to sleep with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the proceedings .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without the increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously when the patient is at their BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we &apos;re waiting for too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have associated with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not take all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Ne@@ ar East fall .
the Tibetan Buddhist guide demanded that violence to stop violence in the native countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the last refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be submitted to the interests of individual nations or continents .
he also stressed that the response of West European countries was ad@@ mi@@ red by the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts were engaged in the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we need to think about how the killing is decreased in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these issues , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and , according to George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , revealed that the US violent response was a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he replaced violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .

many of the attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ ked .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with strawberry , grapes and orange fruits , which are very appealing for children .
hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
few sp@@ atter can cause a few sp@@ atter for alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical Director of the poison not@@ icing centre in Kansas City University , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let whis@@ ky whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children come to it then it is a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from the earthquake of strawberry @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants in the school , was brought to treatment in an emergency .
her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally a drunk in adults , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor that treated them at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah wa@@ iled her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors later over@@ saw them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , because the girls had fallen by the alcohol and pushed the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ Netanyahu &apos;s mother , CNN .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected to death cases .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario for the ra@@ vel of Handel Group , which contains a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
staff of health authorities believe that the product me@@ thanol contained , a fatal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York had planned to forget her &quot; common &quot; teacher , trained by anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; according to a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against Handel @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants and served them from their room .
the police looked at the refer@@ enced plan as &quot; squ@@ at@@ ät@@ z , &quot; and inter@@ disciplinary measures to the school authority .
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ m in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen to a cris@@ p victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Cel@@ tic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talking about dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors of dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y near Cel@@ tic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under elevated control as they prepare for the con@@ frontation with the Dutch tabernacle leaders .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football bo@@ red Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
former rank @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the rank .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they do not show highlights of the Cel@@ tic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the rank &apos;s rank are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the rank .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams , and that is what they are interested .
there are a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only those in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swear D@@ eila .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eila was accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the Norwegian Chef swore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent ex@@ crete from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now stands at the top of the table with five points .
D@@ eila said : &quot; Cel@@ tic had already bad times before and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly like that - but we must pass .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic , because that the player makes better .
now to be gathered is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton c@@ auti@@ ously with January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago that he suggested that he embar@@ ked on some January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is c@@ auti@@ ously with the signing of new arrivals and insi@@ sted that he doesn &apos;t want to inter@@ fere with the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad &apos;s unit .
the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players who come in the summer have this pre@@ season @-@ time to integrate with what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Cel@@ tic @-@ Ziel@@ ona Mich@@ u with withdrawal
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Cel@@ tic during the transfer period in conversation , has noted that he could withdraw , when his contract runs out of the Sw@@ ans .

the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ ne@@ on in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , and added : &quot; it is certainly to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ ne@@ castle if it does not play for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot;

Mc@@ Inn@@ es happy to win against Hamilton &quot; too beautiful . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es grants me that his crew had to fight out against Hamilton action to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half of the year .
Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; there is no team who won everything , play in poker , or li@@ ars who won &apos;t have won the games of this kind . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it rises in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4.000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom had increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the UK@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as the figures for the National Statistics ( dating only ) were shown .
in the meantime , employment fell to Scotland by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the quarter , and a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
commenting on the recent figures , the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market , increasing employment and a decline in unemployment .
drunk disturbed the process
as the security personnel could not satisfy the situation , the employees called the police .
only with the use of pep@@ per@@ spray , the officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody .
a non @-@ alcoholic test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .

why I would be a witness to the execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a bit later , except during a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it is not happen I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day draws near@@ er , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications available to be available , a powerful lot@@ tery take place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is chosen , who will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit alongside Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship during the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness , and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter , my im@@ part@@ ability .
this is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it and you will have access .
I agree with you .
she spati@@ ally admitted she could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orters to be present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work is aid against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the show of Podcasts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I cannot say safety that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would prove him to be a f@@ au@@ ter de@@ ed .
but I believe there is a strong li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there is not enough evidence to justify the death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will die for him .
I can &apos;t claim , really objec@@ tively to be objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters , to which you can turn aside .
what you will get from me is what it means , a man to die unnecessary death .
man after a hum@@ id police pursu@@ er hunting , coming from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale police was dry when he talked about the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man of Perth , to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sum@@ p@@ tuous water , a few metres from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday at a house peace crash incident at Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , this one was trying to escape the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &quot; I am not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned on a reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; a good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do fun things to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Master soccer player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , Cou@@ sins donated his car to the dit@@ ch to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ sins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to al@@ ign him and threat@@ ens to end the racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables in the next year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he aimed at ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity Division of Racing Victoria and claims that they had a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race @-@ day treatment , the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy , Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what is best suited for the racing and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it went about the positive Kob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ our rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is he could not explain .
he had with@@ drew for 18 months for sp@@ ying complaints and did not want it to &quot; look &quot; like highly dro@@ oping grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I did eat long on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .
they know there is far@@ ing .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said .
I will go home tonight , and sleep well .
I want to go on the head , and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for her .
if you start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
then I have to think about what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had attracted the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ ity department had tried to pi@@ onate his stable .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart , in a room with a man - whom I am going to name - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to give information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am an im@@ poster .
if that is the case , you should surely touch their n@@ oses because , in trying to write me , they have failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , re@@ ig@@ ning president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ un@@ dry , at the current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of it and still are today .
should that bring me to the view , that it is in person ?
does the RV@@ L behave and do people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now .
but now I have arrived at the point where no matter is , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and pushing it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fruit levels of the train@@ ers have grown up in the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt @-@ study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to him that he could &quot; throw his license above the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ cut Master Black ca@@ viar , called the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridic@@ ulous , &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse has been applied to the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
I must accept the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my employees has put mud on the leg .
it could have happened last night yesterday .
it would have happened yesterday all day that it was so .
but it had also been so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an inquiry into the matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who move these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one went too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy proposes claims to fight back over Ri@@ vals for claims
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ized critic@@ isms of the tac@@ kling his player as an &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators will have allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hard covered remark concerning the Storm Team , after his crew had reached the Final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday nights . he called the game an &quot; sample example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland were not &quot; too good &quot; in the R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ ham of his team and said that they were concentr@@ ating with the Tac@@ tics only on their &quot; contact &quot; .
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading train@@ ers in his team agree with it , as it means that they are worried , to become defeated by the Storm team .
&quot; it appears again and again - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about the fight battle , when she told us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy spoke on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed anything in our def@@ ensive System or techniques throughout the year . but during the last six weeks we made contact with Tac@@ kles for a real focus , and this has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has seen a great team . he probably did not get to get used to get used to it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is strange , as it appears again at this time of time .
Bell@@ amy has attacked me in the idea of &quot; exciting soccer , &quot; and his ment@@ or reminds us that Benn@@ o St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Prime Minister in 2010 with a &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Wayne talks of exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a cra@@ ck of divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game that you want to play , when you got this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so that they can play as they play .
I build stronger confidence , as they say these things because they are a bit worried , to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it went around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not have any points gri@@ pping ?
for me it is the game boards .
if they mention to us , it means that we will be able to meet them in a phase .
the Storm Team got free on this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales start from next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug ad@@ diction
a man , possibly threatening a lifetime punishment due to his attempt to come to Queensland to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which have been for@@ ged in Queensland against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested the last month after the police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who arrived from South America on V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and arrived in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life penalty for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge of the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the danger of death at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in case of criminal cases he was lied to the police over his place .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics Mutter and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach its release .
&quot; after reading the impressive explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Judge ang@@ agan .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to stop him , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on security deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ duct his austr@@ alian and his Serbian passport , receiving a daily cur@@ few at the age of 18 : 00 - 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure P@@ ma@@ oph@@ ile to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g recorded the girl &apos;s phone when this slept , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , received a series of un@@ interrupted pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl looked up later and found the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she looked through , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ ar@@ ming her mother immediately .
the police looked after and saw the five images , then analysed the computer that were found under the address and discovered &quot; Web @-@ resear@@ ches , which used terms for searching for non @-@ continuous images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile &quot; in the internet , and he said &quot; to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the state lawyer E@@ ili@@ ie Robertson told the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a su@@ p that he is ho@@ oked to sc@@ are people .
he gave to him that the searches were done on the computer of him , but he said it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and sending him to send more photos .
he said he did it to attract her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and he wants to see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then saw the un@@ disputed pictures on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computers and Playst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pleaded guilty to the meaning of the indictment , in@@ constant pictures of children on June 14 last year , to have been denied on January 25 this year , and not before a court hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g appears not in the register of sexual offen@@ ders since they could argue that &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; would be found in his failure .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael shi@@ fted the sentence by October to obtain background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted a security deposit in this case but was kept in custody for some time even in rem@@ and .
he was still taken from the date of judgment to the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
tra@@ ys soft on small bo@@ arder crossing to Germany

along the border crossing Inn , Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn has been using more than 1000 refugees in the Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot on bridges and fl@@ ashes on the German side .
in fact , they are taken into service by Federal police and for@@ warded it to the registration .
compared to the German police station , the Munich Central Station received more refugees once again on Wednesday at the weekend of the weekend .
there were some 700 people in the provincial capital only up to 8 am , spokes@@ man on the morning .
after re@@ introducing controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city .

this is reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence Days March 17th to September 27 ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented above all this year .
one of the greatest premier@@ es for German motor@@ ways is the Opel Astra , which will be tra@@ pped in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann to the trade fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
so that the volume model also sells well , the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
Opel re@@ alizes a kick @-@ off of the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf in the prospec@@ t of 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is from 16 € 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen is offering further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines will also count .
unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is initially only one five @-@ door Corsa .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
and what will be next to the Astra at the IAA still on new compact trade ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e stand exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a emphas@@ ized sports GT version .
in the next year , he comes to trade in the beginning , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ off@@ shoot wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved cut lines will fit into the brand design line .
the basic model is a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : a new segment , the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
its maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton metres ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno national park is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed , the compact car model DS 4 , which is shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
outside , the Designer of the Designer Citroën @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers mainly laid hands on front of the front panel : the radiator gr@@ ille was re @-@ drawn and the changed head@@ light with LED technology was equipped .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been modernis@@ ed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated into Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , a series of over@@ working and new variants such as the frozen Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres cell are more human
the Federal Constitutional Court issued an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the judicial system Te@@ gel , which has been accommod@@ ated in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their lives , prisoners were basically eligible for financial compensation when they are housed in small cells .
this decision adopted the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the affected may even hope the judges might hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : it was housed in the judicial facility in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , which is now restored according to his lawyer , has now been installed in a bigger cell .
his adher@@ ence was failed because of the question@@ able detention conditions against the country of Berlin .
but the Constitutional Judge lifted the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of the Berlin Chamber and referred to the case for a new trial .
you see the man &apos;s human dignity .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons , only a few days of detention to be paid for the compensation period , there was a compensation for compensation .
otherwise , &quot; an attempt to worry of the legal protection of the personality is to fear . &quot;
the Chamber of Kammer@@ spiele must now clari@@ fy the amount of money bur@@ dens .
the constitu@@ encies in the past have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners .
thus they first said in April of a prisoner for damages , because he was in prison naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 according to the multi @-@ technical chamber without a separate toilet .
moreover , on Wednesday he also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which held a prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ ism in a parall@@ el@@ ism in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs more than three months a day , between 15 and 21 hours , in a similar cell as in the Kar@@ ls case .
the Berlin j@@ ails came to the head@@ lines in recent weeks , too .
prisoners are therefore kept alive again for 23 hours , the aggressi@@ veness , even to dro@@ med@@ aries , it shall be already possible due to the stra@@ ined situation .
according to information from the Justice Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young athletes , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor has determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers come to Germany this year , according to the testimony of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated it with the unusual challenge of resolution : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we do . &quot;
what comes to Germany is con@@ veys the following overview .
according to various forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) homes yearly - and for the next five years .
this almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space , however , mainly due to affordable rental properties : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments are out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favorable flats will also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
consequently , scientists and Federal Minister affir@@ med that there must be more tax advantages for residential construction in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( Professional research ) , 55 percent of those who are employed in Germany are employed in the long @-@ term .
however , refugees arrive in Germany not systematically asked about their quali@@ fications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , Project manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is important whether they find work in Germany .
work may be the key to social contacts , for appreciation at the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the listen@@ ers , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , a political turn was given : the for@@ b@@ ade for refugees in recognition of labour .
whereas previously a job ban on asylum seek@@ ers were up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ dency if the asylum seek@@ ers are limited .
in society itself - even because of the lack of professionals , majority of visibility is consistent , that refugees should be made fast access to the job market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the job market are lack of German .
so far , there is no ongoing offer of general and professional language courses .
research also show that jobs are most often con@@ veyed by personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore the Königs@@ weg path for working integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only few moved parents to give up their children in Kit@@ as , it is estimated that ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is only important to gather the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Kos@@ chemistry , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family from the advantages of K@@ ita , the administration offices are in different languages .
should the need of educ@@ ators severely rise by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase capacity to the Berlin Senate by giving more specialist schools .
in the countries , students are prepared without German knowledge of welcome groups .
they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack in them , says Be@@ ate Po@@ ems from the Berlin school administration .
the German student union estimates that some 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Federal State of asylum seek@@ ers or thought to study - the only exception was Berlin , internal en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) now ab@@ orted his attitude .
student @-@ giving refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
for refugees with a matter of stay or for@@ tification , no benefits after asylum seek@@ ers are more when they start studying .
the latter did not get B@@ A@@ fr@@ ö@@ g because they do not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ lame individuals .
Ged@@ ulative refugees had to have been living in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ Af@@ gan@@ s , to be shortened from January 1 , 2016 to 15 months .
but these financing pieces must also be closed , they demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should immediately get B@@ A@@ fr@@ ö@@ g .
Islam is going to play an important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , the religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually s@@ essive the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches will continue to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship .
the creation of an Islamic welfare state is also important to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights are also obligations .
thus , the representatives of Islam must unite to clear contact partners and be ready to work together with the state in many fields and some control possibilities .
this includes the read@@ iness to proceed to religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , on Thursday vo@@ iced the concern , religious conflicts also could be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to au@@ stri@@ ve such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately made their right to stay here , &quot; in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
there will be much more integration than today a topic of the whole society .
thereby , the controlling society will change , the breakdown of discrimination and rac@@ ism is urgent .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - since a short@@ age of decade , anti @-@ discrimination laws and a distribution of equality law .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ ship showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the subject .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants organisations and interest groups are non @-@ white German already demand long and what international agreement as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism of Germany must be reality in the coming years if the country will remain peace@@ fully and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany will be able to provide medical support to the previously expected refugees , Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery says .
&quot; in terms of man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel .
but additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls for health tickets right at the registration of health cards .
later , services could be reck@@ oned with the federal states .
and long @-@ term , it is highly question@@ able to intensi@@ fy so many people with the limited power catalogue , which pre @-@ view the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , physicians make mainly the language bar@@ riers .
previously , the Berlin health scientist Theater , The@@ a Bor@@ de , thus proved to be worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in physician &apos;s surg@@ eries would have to be taken over , requ@@ est@@ ing them .
many refugees have also been helped with more general medical applications in the emergency treatment plants .
and with another diagnostic glance .
in Refu@@ gee , there are some more un@@ treated Dis@@ abilities , and with the young people , it is about HIV @-@ En@@ lighten@@ ment .
but German doctors from their formation were apparent , but clearly stated , Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes .
&quot; Paras@@ ite in@@ fest@@ ation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; and as for the medical angel , even in sight is perhaps even in sight .
the Syrians would have become a sophisticated education system , some of the refugees are even doctors .
however , in order to practice sessions , however , they would have to prove their quali@@ fications and ex@@ pose them completely .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Federal Ministry of Health ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) . most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially viol@@ ates are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich showed that every fifth of the Syrian refugee is trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
those who fall in a post @-@ trau@@ matic requirement disorder is suffering , among others , to so @-@ called Flash@@ back with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe tum@@ bling , and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms of chronic , an early treatment would be necessary , Mun@@ z stated .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees are receiving a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide a request for psycho@@ therapy , but they usually lasts several months .
in addition , in social offices mostly property worker or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this lead to false ass@@ essments , says Mun@@ z .

the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst returned to the traditions of cir@@ cus art with the new st@@ aging &quot; Passion . &quot;

Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mug@@ abe holds a false speech in parliament
Mr Mug@@ abe , African &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the case of the case spread rapidly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also made by alleg@@ ations made by members of the Opposition , that they would have been anonymous to death threats and warned them against accompanying Mr Mug@@ abe with Bu@@ ehr@@ er &apos;s speech .
last month they had hat@@ ched him , and during his speech given to the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mug@@ an@@ es .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she told the title &apos; death &apos; , that he said to Mug@@ an@@ es .
the members of the Parliament warns that the immun@@ ity has ended in parliament , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , its parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .
chief speaker , that led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , was &quot; concerned &quot; with the dangers for the politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to provide 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
in this year , HP will share two publicly tra@@ ded companies and share the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected value reduction leads to a load of over $ 2.7 billion in the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive that will lead the unity after the separation .
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise becomes smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned as ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be concentr@@ ating on delivering un@@ at@@ tain@@ able technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , and have called the Palo Alto Garage to the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive re@@ structure to handle the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area which is based on the belief that closely focused businesses a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was first September and provided that his rehabilitation after plan is , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optimi@@ stic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history its participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate Kn@@ uck@@ les injury and then back to his old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened with the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , which did not heal well .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his kn@@ uck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from purely medical point of view , but such as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the appropriate danger of another injuries , always when one player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of the 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five times .
the wider image for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League of clubs since 2007 / 08 , which experienced most vulnerable days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the risk ratio will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you return from an injury , you have a gra@@ dient period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run out of the way he deserves .
Arsenal starts his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and around Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger makes a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ v Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveling to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are starting to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ c@@ ott .
&quot; I try to stop the balance and the players who need it to allow a small car@@ ving break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are continuing through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the slots with the largest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season has been launched .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday , during the Richter scale in 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al dra@@ gged the teaching from the past season with the Champions @-@ League capital against Monaco and ab@@ orted from distant hope to lead the club to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked out for arsen@@ al .
we were in the year 2006 very close to it , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the shop to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship festival : the comedy show , which gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now still more doub@@ ted than ever before , such as self @-@ mor@@ ates among young males prove on a 15 @-@ year high @-@ action .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ors ( CA@@ LM - Camp@@ a@@ ign with a bad life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the goal of asking the culture in question if they need them to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart in battle to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms prove that , when the suffering has a sufficient high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , &quot; his chances had doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual healthy friends wear the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends once , so that friendship can work .
in the age of social media , communic@@ ating with its emphasis on the substance , the in@@ medi@@ ability of the answer is more important than an important source of importance .
our digital life have the need to be strong , fun and successful , doubles , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what a psych@@ ologist ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values provide ; money , image , social status , everything at cost in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire explained recently , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focusing on the head was put on .
each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , who sh@@ ined by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents in the football watch in cozy n@@ ett@@ les and the lon@@ ging from Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can rely on each case , even if they are often going back to explore completely their feelings .
like a co @-@ employee of the telephone call , I explained to myself : ... &quot; my conc@@ ei@@ ving role for people who are de@@ pressed and confident , really clearly shows me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends could make a difference . &quot;

Maria meets G@@ PS@@ G to help PS@@ G to m@@ ite Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malmö .
after his debut in the Champions League at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass through Malmö .
here are the Game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh , stuck behind Cav@@ ani as Paris Saint @-@ Germain had held its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of its Champions League de@@ but@@ ts than PS@@ G players who brought the French champion to the way , but thereafter they missed a range of opportunities before they finally increased their advantage when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A needs Paris a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they are not only aiming for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ s Team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later in play against his home @-@ home team and against the club , with whom he began his illustr@@ ate career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to get problems and look relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; it &apos;s a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it , we have not yet had another two goals . &quot;
in one of three changes in the Paris team returned after his injury to the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 @-@ 2 draw on its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but was pushed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian cap was referred to as the man named PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , and he interpreted to why , when he ran in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö defense , before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and past the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would be a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off beat off this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine National players on the field and was steep@@ ed in a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed away far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they had little in attack .
instead , PS@@ G also gave himself up , with some patches with mis@@ fortune and bad abst@@ entions , who was not more than five trials in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had deployed him after the restart .
nevertheless he pointed out a lot more skill when he brought his fellow player to the game , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , Di Maria was transformed into a turning shot , which was diver@@ ted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to the Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth end of the season , after she had f@@ ished a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
this finished all the idea that Mal@@ mo could return to the game , and only an excellent input from Wil@@ and from a short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to hold the end result too low before replacing the E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi writing .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later said that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

world and European champion X@@ avi play for the ally @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern obviously stood before a few years before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , which then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner winner , four times winner League winner , twice Club World Champion , twice European champion , a time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .

and the registered version of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ man wanted me to have . &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in movie making
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a result of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown found that this meant the need of alternative perspectives and , in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the elected script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then we do it with the instr@@ umentation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on .
brown re@@ acted , sho@@ cked with worn un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actors held by The Mar@@ tian .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to add people to think about it - who will always be the director , how they wanted to treat the figure of the harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People has sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing the film ; Dam@@ on rep@@ lied that their direction &quot; could give us a little &quot; at the end that we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion has been broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded about women &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ eta pressed his anger through the clip , saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on speaks about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - that is SO WE@@ KNOW that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the ban was more than 5,000 res@@ ets and 4,000 liqu@@ eurs since its release .
Dam@@ ons comments are coming to a point where rac@@ tical representation in the media on the top of social discussion stands .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement of Black lives Mat@@ ter &apos;s nation@@ ally increased effect and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against col@@ dness .
in February , singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums happ@@ ily , &quot; ( albums still have their significance ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their importance .
in more recently , leaders of the movement Black lives Mat@@ ter released a statement and in response to the question of Fox @-@ news personality Elizabeth H@@ assel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hatred @-@ group .
the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le that are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation , or has already taken the Pope , is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; Cro@@ wning first champion
professional sport climbing and operating instruc@@ tors Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition @-@ show , which has just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to close all levels of his obst@@ acle course .
during the season finale they made two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the finals .
for the last task , climbing to a 75 @-@ foot climbing part , the climbing was part of 30 seconds .
British finished the task within the time to complete the first ath@@ lete who finished the challenging phase 4 of the American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished the challenge full three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! messages after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or for life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap money .
quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed won with The Hollywood reporter driving the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first completed the course of the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , the one receives the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he got a den@@ arius about that .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he won awards of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same thing as they missed the roles .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for a rough season , the fil@@ ming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak on Minnesota T@@ wins past
mint L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit &apos;s Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the top teams in bas@@ eball , today &apos;s Tig@@ ers are standing on the final place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but they played their part on Tuesday at the same time against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field .
the T@@ wins still strug@@ gled a chance to climb in a game of Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League of Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so hard to summar@@ ize on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ sies .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit looks three times in the first two interior , then once in the sixth and then once more in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck last 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and enabled three r@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen every game , and so I &apos;m completely concentrated in the game .
the newly designated tiger H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has good sharp@@ ened on the pl@@ ywood , &quot; said Aus@@ sies .
he looked good at ( stroke training ) , looked clearly better from the bull@@ do@@ zers , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear of the seventh place , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get into the game again .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought back his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed over the wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted with the newly designated ro@@ ok@@ ie de Miguel S@@ ano , which is the right @-@ handed tri@@ w ver@@ h@@ agen a Two @-@ Run event .
a pair of trucks and the end @-@ run on the second brought Ver@@ h@@ agen the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double Play .
it was this in the major league leading 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe got a double Play .
after Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth ward , wall hang@@ s an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed cut S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for its fifth gear .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the out@@ set of the game by a still non @-@ moving Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three leaders in the first two inside against the handed @-@ handed veter@@ an , which had been painted before the game of the fo@@ wl list , after he had been frozen for more than a month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I was desired , &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; but I felt des@@ irable when I was rele@@ asing and felt that I would create some quite good pitch since the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off batt@@ aries , H@@ ull issued a single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the partners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers were put in the second , generated a One @-@ Out Double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and one two @-@ out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he was not particularly defeated , but he caught the right spot .
Hug@@ hes was located in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , and scored no points in the third inning , before it was replaced by the A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver Right @-@ sh@@ ale .
at Hug@@ hes there came to three hits at six hits and a walk with four kn@@ itting outs .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal Sanchez was due to an injury of the throwing ow@@ l .
he was studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who was oper@@ able by the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , since mid @-@ August on the fo@@ iling list due to a shoulder dist@@ ortion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with Sanchez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is canc@@ eled by the injuries list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was bought in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has bo@@ arded since 20 August due to a err@@ ation in the right thigh .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minnesota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to join in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the road to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the most excited people are supposed to be accommod@@ ated in emer@@ gen@@ cies in Wiesbaden , as the town of Wiesbaden received on Tuesday evening .
it calculated 450 to 750 years of refugees .

there are up to 1000 refugees temporarily .
they should then be distributed over to other municipalities .
according to the President of the responsible government responsible for the first time alone in the past ten days , Gießen 7@@ 500 people have arrived in Hessen .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up for the great number of refugees in Spor@@ th@@ eria .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria a option
the Leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; I think the thinking about military action options may not be held without Germany , &quot; he said .
he au@@ tho@@ red the European states &quot; Colle@@ ctive For@@ ks . &quot;
four years ago we had been glad that the cup of a military involvement in Germany passed by .
now the conflict broke in front of our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive adv@@ ancement on international assistance for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and Eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has also re@@ inst@@ ated controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister for Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , was also sent to Hungary as well .
also in Germany , I sent no refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , this has been so agreed &quot; , &quot; she declared .
on the question of an agreement to which Germany could provide a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , there have already been present talks between the General Director of Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
concrete numbers did not name them and pointed out on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past days , tens of thousands of refugees came across the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann in common with several other EU leaders in cooperation with a special summit for next week .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states so far not have agreed upon a joint action in the crisis .
the EU interior ministers want to take on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) to meet a new starting point to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government plans to support the Länder and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage it together with the Länder , on the late Tuesday evening after nearly four months of consultations with the Prime Minister of the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery in Berlin .
Merkel stressed , those people who would need to be so@@ lic@@ able also .
but he who has no lead pro@@ spective , could also remain in Germany .
this opinion was also expressed in the turn .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed the state as a whole , now a &quot; huge strength of force &quot; must cope with .
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are stuck on the Balkan route .
from the night on Tuesday , Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia .
for a few hours afterwards the government in Budapest announced the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbour neighbouring country belongs to the EU as Serbia .
Hungary wants to prevent t@@ ug@@ boat from Romania over Romania , said the Minister for Foreign Affairs , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to , to the planned new border .
the Romanian government condem@@ ns the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
in Turkey because e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands of migrants in the way to the Greek border .

this diving motion is only small , but still too large for a full rise in cel@@ est@@ ial body , it is written in the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( state state New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers presented their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover .
so in 2006 Cas@@ sin@@ i had discovered iron vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Satur@@ n@@ monds , the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of the Saturn .
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , astronom@@ ers closed back then .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but whoever wants to pay attention to his slim figure , is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially its suc@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are still healthy : in them are B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , Mang@@ os contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta @-@ car@@ otene .
those who eat fruit , consequently also support vision , immune system and met@@ abolic process in the body .
when buying , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or to be firm and pleasant smell .
the form@@ work color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green Mang@@ os can taste very tasty .
you should store at room temperature and are consumed within less days .
then they naturally taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go gives also heart@@ y dishes a special touch .
it mel@@ ts the slightly bitter flavor of a leaf@@ y salad such as Chic@@ ore@@ e and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Mang@@ och@@ ut@@ ney looks good for fish , poultry , lamb and wild .

the following days are in the north @-@ aut@@ um@@ nal with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
in the presence of Municip@@ ality of Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , a previously known square in the park was christ@@ ened at the Opp@@ io Hill in the name of the German re@@ formers .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome , near the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the Protestant churches of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often seen as a minority in the un@@ seen past their faith .
the square becomes visi@@ bly visible in a symbolic way that the Christian faith tradition in Rome be welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) kept himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k by the turn of the year 1510 @-@ 11 , a few months in Rome .
he emp@@ s the city at that time as a bl@@ ended sin@@ e@@ ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions will be em@@ bodied by histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
with his thes@@ es , Luther continued to run the split of the Western Church .
Hammer artists invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn is one of the main works painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and read biblical texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible which now has appeared with prehistoric pictures .
at the beginning there was an image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who form@@ ulated about 150 moti@@ fs of his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and fan@@ ciful forms has the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can quite be quite dark .
for about three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he had a sub@@ jective artistic selection from the many them@@ atic areas of the &quot; Book of All Books . &quot;
these are cycles that are subject to themes like crosses , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or father@@ hood .
with this spont@@ aneously he has fascin@@ ated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its main emphasis on art books .
and above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who argu@@ ed himself on the basis of painting with the particular Bible verses .
he is interpreted by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into Today , in current relations . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
it is nestled between the original bi@@ ble @-@ schol@@ ar of Martin Luther and each one of the artist who , here , form@@ ulates his personal idea about the particular situation .
the jewelry cord is golden cou@@ sins .
so the 75 year old allows double the deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
that is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions became a major trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , desc@@ ending from a family that belonged to the strict rule of parliament .
&quot; since then , up@@ bringing together with the cane , &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to say the art in faster time again to more jobs : &quot; the perception of imag@@ inations is influenced by advertising today , and that is no@@ isy .
Symb@@ ol@@ ism is being pushed there .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always been a mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
Ot@@ mar : I want to inv@@ ade the viewer in the pictures , &quot; letting them appear , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost approached on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot; I like to have been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like living with his pictures . &quot;
I don &apos;t care about it to completely cap@@ itali@@ ze the Bible , but chosen for him important , also mysterious topics .
&quot; this was not a collaboration with eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; be a pictures of the Bible .
for Hans Mö@@ hler , Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for fittings both ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and screen shot - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15th .
start of construction on BM@@ X track
plans turned , place found , company instruc@@ ts the course of a circuit : one year later it was almost anything finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was already finished .
mit@@ ig@@ ations in politics and administration looked for land@@ slide , especially with the residents , who did not toler@@ ate the rail .
so hill buried , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will go down in October , with Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock , the First Commun@@ ion in the Children and Youth Committee .
&quot; I hope this year passed even more visible , &quot; she said .
it should be started without &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; with the works in the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to 2019 , and the Bundesliga was a clear sign at the weekend .
football re@@ acts to the apparent situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the politics to help control the forth@@ coming problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can no one say in principle , that &apos;s nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must always be interested in getting this topic in the handle , &quot; DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach said .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the German Chanc@@ ell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State , Ms. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could help and wool .
but the decisive points must provide politics .
for this reason , the German So@@ ccer Federation has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 to a four years .
&quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun foundation , we ensured that this program continues to run until 2019 , &quot; N@@ ren@@ s@@ bach stated on the br@@ ink of the UEFA conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
already at this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ li@@ ver@@ ts make a clear signal , if they are on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ en@@ ol ( Hermes ) will help to &quot; help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone , where and how they can only do , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ boss Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler published the &quot; Image &quot; Newspaper ( Tuesday ) and called the project as &quot; sel@@ fis@@ hness . &quot;
&quot; the refugee resi@@ des every day , no one may take away . &quot;
&quot; we can play football @-@ federal states , no , we need to use our jet @-@ power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have been so incredibly positive , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
for the EM qualifying match against Hungary this Friday , the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach marked the support of refugees as &quot; a great community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 Lic@@ ens@@ ing had launched their own projects in their places , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent , is living in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees in cooperation with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; the clubs have already called down the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach .
report : SAP Chairman loses an eye in an accident
the head of head of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reportedly lost the left eye through a fall at the beginning of July .
after the accident at his brother &apos;s house in the US , he retired after midnight on a water @-@ glass which he had carried away in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost im@@ pover@@ ished , being power@@ less , she sto@@ wed out to the streets - that he told us so rel@@ ates last week , &quot; cited the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go after his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet in front of the supervisory board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is involved in the meeting and &quot; fully jo@@ bless . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday of Thursday ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continuing to lead the software company .
&quot; I &apos;m fully charged for SAP , &quot; full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I stood at regular contact with the Supervisory Board and his chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the United States , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to say to the public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen to something so . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s important to get up again , if you &apos;ve fallen . &quot;

football : Bv@@ Q without Re@@ us vs. Kras@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes on a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us final in the first group of the Europa League will be crushed .
the national player will also be missing the race leader of the football Bundesliga with the F@@ k Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.00 PM / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether Re@@ us will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him into the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his pedi@@ gre@@ e to the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change on the ke@@ epers .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place for the German firm Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained in an absolute top level , &quot; the soccer team praised the world champion .
if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in the future in all Europe @-@ League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left however open .
with a high probability , it will also dispute the second game .
the for@@ ging statement by fellow player Re@@ us that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League must be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l holds the goal : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
robots cars : government wants leadership role for Germany
according to the will of the German government , Germany should be the change of the technological inci@@ dents .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet approved a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which includes further investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke to Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse International Motor Show from a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
the automated , net@@ worked driving will increase the traffic safety and ensure less st@@ ems , Do@@ brin@@ dt said .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G7 countries , who will also come together with representatives of the industry .
the strategic paper of the Ministry of Communications emphas@@ izes the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and an ongoing focus on digital radio radio .
for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
in order to avoid an additional liability risks , the German government plans to review the legal framework conditions , &quot; and wherever necessary to custom@@ ize the new developments . &quot;
for example , Germany wants to be used internationally for example , that the permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which only sees people as a driver to date .
when automated driving will take over the car the driver , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that cap@@ tures the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study published by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving will be technically possible by 2020 .
even in public roads , less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected shortly after 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany will appreciate the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws may lead to more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said SPD traffic officer S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l .
the question of liability in accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver has to be clearly clari@@ fied .
still the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA Institute for the For@@ sa Institute , commissioned by the investig@@ ator DE@@ K@@ RA , only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be implemented in the next ten years , while 32 percent do not expect it in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed by 2025 with autonomous cars , in the US 33 per cent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave themselves completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
according to a survey of the digital network , only seven percent would agree to pass down control during the total ride on all roads .
on the highway , they could introduce at least 15 percent in the flowing traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent .
good everyone would leave the car to control under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says team - and double start at ping @-@ p@@ ong @-@ EM
according to present , the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will comm@@ ence on May 25 to October 4 , only in singles .
the final decision is due to be released on 22 September at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo made the title , &quot; said Bundest@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ Teacher in Dus@@ sel@@ dorf .
B@@ oll was located at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to come back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are now no longer a clear favorite , &quot; declared single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the etz@@ qu@@ eue in Ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , was remin@@ ded of the EM 2013 in Schwe@@ chat .
&quot; at that time , Timo also had fallen , and we became the European champion . &quot;
&quot; in this context , we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; the world interest rate explained .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a en@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of quite large fashion show and a juni@@ per @-@ per@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which looks terri@@ fying human due to vide@@ opro@@ jec@@ tions .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , who , amongst others , got the stage out@@ fits to the great star of fashion scene , so that he put men in skirts .
&quot; I can &apos;t say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant guy of the hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was easy , and meanwhile it is real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18th at the Kuns@@ thalle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good fortune that fashion designers has changed his own way to a look about his person .
in fact , he had been against it , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had already taken place in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it &apos;s about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of man , who has written fashion history without ever completing training .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an excellent , chore@@ ograph@@ ed work of works , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist is engaged for example .
14 tons of material have spar@@ ked the makers of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October Festival was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather pants out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( women are slaugh@@ tering as men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , said Gaul@@ tier .
G@@ aul &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is also shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ious fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted to his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and dresses , said Gaul@@ tier .
with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has made fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , as Gaul@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought these things , of course .
for his first fashion show he did not pay the models .
they received nothing , but could keep the sh@@ am@@ ots .
jewelry held instead of yar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ger tip as fashion @-@ nut
previously , the long embro@@ ider@@ y machines in and around pl@@ under@@ took to make meters tall .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and tips were developed in large amounts for customers , which they worked as blank@@ ets and she@@ er curtains .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains , managing director of Mo@@ hawk fl@@ ashes .
instead , fashion is important .
in the initial times of the pl@@ unger point , fashion played a major role , then it pushed back through the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls a few examples : top in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
the so @-@ called Vintage mode which leans on past stal@@ ks , an increasing contractor .
whoever serves no niche in the textile branch in Germany isn &apos;t on the market anymore .
in us , they are making up half of all orders .
Mo@@ dies@@ t Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Ho@@ und with nine other companies .
only they must wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been broken .
wholesale outlets and also wholesale are almost no longer .
our products hardly reach our customers on this path .
the mass production will be produced far cheaper in Asian region , and almost exclusively driven by chains .
they are also vulnerable to export , current to Russia and USA .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association is also attemp@@ ting to score points , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embro@@ ider@@ y in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been guiding a quality seal that shows that we have been able to produce ecological and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger regional Academy of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ y and lace .
to op@@ pose the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
there is a tension field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that must be thought of particularly economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a list of existing design is often only varies in order to keep a customer base .
recently some years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re @-@ new the historical snow @-@ pointed tip .
the machine receives small kitchen joints in some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ stre@@ at Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ville inspired himself : &quot; previously I could not start talking with traditional pl@@ um . &quot;
now they use the snow height for their jewelry .
in a lav@@ ish case , it shapes the pattern in silver .
many people of the region identify themselves with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers who have lived their ancestors in the building and surrounding area and who wish to have a mem@@ ento .
thus I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Lodge .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie

XI p@@ ushes to open the economy wider for the world
the economy has to be bro@@ ader opening up , in order to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering .
&quot; China should be used to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business activities , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
raising new curiosity and advance reforms in new ways and provide new space for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the guide group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for arrangement of market access , relaxing the border checks policy , promoting public funds ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population @-@ based system .
according to the statement , a negative list is created , sectors and companies identified , which will not come into question for investments .
the system is tested and tested by test programs .
the initiative is of importance since it promotes the market a greater part in the allocation of resources , which guarantees illegal business environment and re@@ designed the market , said the statement .
the government will also encourage controls over the powers that are transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how they lead their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow China to allow cross @-@ border economic hard@@ ship operations and new mechanisms for promote regional growth .
under an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas will be open for private investment .
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitim@@ ate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services to them , &quot; said the statement .
moreover , it will be made easier for foreigners , to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card , &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and application process .
the law of attor@@ neys to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leader as Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli also participated in the meeting , as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU plans to double mercury @-@ limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and provide a significantly higher dose of thr@@ ills .
F@@ ood@@ watch , the Consumer Organization based on the EU , critic@@ ised the plans seriously : &quot; risks and side effects are lacking in industrial and environment policy with full impact on pregnant women and infants , &quot; says Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said to have the limit values of the nerve pal@@ ft@@ es for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ ks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic @-@ economic reasons &quot; of one on two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly contra@@ sted with mercury that on the still applicable limit values should not be sold around 50 per cent of the length .
after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be compens@@ ated .
in exchange for this loos@@ ening , the EU plans to intensi@@ fy the limits of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0,1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller peac@@ o@@ ons , such as car@@ p usually bur@@ dened as low as low as they already comply with the planned maximum values .
the lowering of the se@@ wage is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des di@@ stra@@ ction of di@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; says Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a high @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal , which is particularly enri@@ ching over the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; there are already small amounts of particularly severe damage in the nervous system , particularly in new@@ bor@@ ns .
the Federal Ministry of Justice spoke at its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health risk of the general population &quot; would not be expected .
mercury reaches the environment through coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information report by the German Federal Ministry of Justice , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ ly ordered more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume issued in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; had the &quot; Spiegel &quot; cited in March out of paper .
in the past year , mercury @-@ wide war@@ nings of mercury in fish already reported to the most common reported health risks in the EU @-@ warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
