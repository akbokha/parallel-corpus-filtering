the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not friendly .
they both wanted to implement the international agreement and Teheran to speak dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing steps in the Middle East .
there is also a conflict in the Palestinians , the Palestinians and the discussing two @-@ state solution .
for years , the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been cl@@ amped .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuing housing construction of Israel and raises the lack of peace on the peace process .
the deal continued by Obama wor@@ sen@@ ed the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two wor@@ sen@@ ed further .
in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech to the Congress of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , partially exploited against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting was rejected with regard to the forth@@ coming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , his girl@@ friend shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon lamb said , with a certain beg@@ gar voice of the police , that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb , it was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note , which was critical on a white block , I loved to do it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who had travelled to the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , who had already travelled for 300 miles to the school grounds , who , according to the police , had a popular story processor , E@@ than Schmidt , shot and killed on the door to his office .
Delta State University police officer Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford told that universal employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the f@@ ate@@ ful emergency call sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day , there was a further death : when the police took him , the police took him down .
one day after shooting in the university , students and lec@@ turers &quot; forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to pro@@ cure yourself a picture of what Lamb &apos;s motivated .
the details published by the agencies on both ends of the state have published their details , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped them draw a picture of a talented , but potentially difficult teachers .
students said that they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , he did not have history of violence or criminal record .
he was mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations related to problem@@ atic behavior .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers who praised the Lamb , said that he was too excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was false with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to take care for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year , he only instructed two online courses .
the newest amendments to the university &apos;s employment policy was that the promotion , for the Lamb had worked so hard for the Lamb , would not guarantee an automatic way to an application as Assistant Professor .
chief President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knows nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ p Ide@@ a . &quot;
these are questions , the Lamb can &apos;t answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs , when he returned to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of its parent building on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran in the entry .
it wasn &apos;t clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
the guy began his work at the University , which attracted 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants . he established ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he earned his doctorate in the spring of education .
one of the many years @-@ long girl@@ friends described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and fun .
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her guitar play .
then he was the s@@ warm of women .
all the girls had melted away when he was there , &quot; Hair@@ y said , &quot; now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Bran@@ don .
lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificates from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house that ad@@ mi@@ red to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ un@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
they and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but he heard , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues .
lamb met Pr@@ un@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail ran both on a summer @-@ fair three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse , who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes maintenance coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a fe@@ eb@@ le at G@@ auti@@ er , said that he finished his guitar and Pr@@ un@@ iss Night on the night of September 5 after he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic qu@@ ad over a peaceful audience .
there was no signs of anything that anything was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the sho@@ cks and lad@@ ed together .
I mean they both had a good sense for j@@ est@@ ing .
Schmidt , the t@@ ote Professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in the U.S. and colonial history , with Don Allan Mitchell , a English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .

&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now affir@@ med that Lamb had shot his call when he had shot his wife , and that he had written a letter in his emergency call Pr@@ un@@ iss , but there is no indication of that the two have ever been married .

Michael J. Fox Sl@@ ates about his &quot; Date , &quot; Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a major moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is empty next to me , and it will gradually tell me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to me in mind that I am a sim@@ ulated guest and an arm length of it , with the prin@@ cess of Wales on a date .

UN Chef says there is no military solution in Syria
ban Ki @-@ moon seeks its response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN Group once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support political negotiations for finding a political solution .
in ban , a press conference on Wednesday said that he plans to meet the Foreign Minister of the five permanent member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - to meet the meeting of the General Assembly during this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the att@@ itudes within the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers can make this situation in@@ separ@@ able . &quot;

8 valuation values show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have attempted to brand him as a flop .
others have taken it as a joke .
and some waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to move Donald Tr@@ ump into p@@ olls from the above p@@ olls in the p@@ olls , it doesn &apos;t work yet .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start question@@ ing what it means for the odds of nom@@ ination of real estate .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts acknowledge that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys ab@@ dicated leadership to the rising Herman Cain , and no one only gained a state in the nomin@@ ating process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but external trade groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ es Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now acknowledge tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and start to run their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values , which indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary stage :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers keep in early states .
an Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa saw last week that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have got a good opinion of ro@@ gue .
two third of the GO@@ P elec@@ torate GO@@ P would be happy with de@@ pl@@ ump than candidates .
in a CNN pol@@ l survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; angry , &quot; if the candidate is the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent saying they would be &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent , which could say the same over Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio is 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; angry , &quot; if Je@@ ther Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely used for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul says , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first provisional state of State , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute effectively his job , and nearly six out of 10 independent say that his temper@@ ament is not to place the White House , so ABC / post .
republi@@ can voters are getting used to the idea .
when they open their for@@ sin@@ ten@@ se , republi@@ can voters keep the dump in real .
if you are asked who wins the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say a survey from CNN / OR@@ C last week four of ten that the ump is the best bet .
this is a change since time , when four of July their money put their money on Je@@ ther Bush .
full publication : GO@@ P voters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination towards only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a large number of bur@@ ial voters is a plau@@ sible campaign than plau@@ sible campaign .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump makes it even almost everyone .
some experts suggest that the breaking field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps lead , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support occurs more than a dozen of other candidates diff@@ use .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , Com@@ ump rais@@ als the majority .
he has ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before Je@@ ther Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Edge Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would out@@ fit the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a big majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans tells us that they have formed their mind .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only little more than half of voters , the dump , say that they have received their voices .
of course , much will happen to change that , and no one can really say the opinion .
46 per cent said they leave the door open to change other candidates .
nonetheless , tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ der , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind , are twice as frequent to tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with def@@ enders in the issue of Immig@@ ration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump has named &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; by his election campaign two months ago , the Immig@@ ration and Angel@@ s reached the public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic for@@ b@@ ump of Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republican Party and will damage the territorial efforts .
but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with tr@@ ump at questions of immigration .
as long as immigration remains in the lim@@ el@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently will do .
the fru@@ strations on the government clim@@ bs on new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republican voters now falls , above all through their under@@ dog status .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new day @-@ day survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political under@@ dog as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry in Washington .
a survey carried out by Des Mo@@ ines Register to Bloomberg in Io@@ wa ago two weeks ago that three of four Io@@ wa rep@@ ublic@@ ans have fru@@ str@@ ated over the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg place there is the most expensive residential community - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter square meter for an average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is natural , &quot; it says in the study - that is why the high price .
a new study shows what particular locations are a square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student booking in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top residential areas , one of the price is pre@@ ten@@ dered , however , as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate Services Angel &amp; Eth@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German motor@@ homes - with square met@@ er@@ prices in dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several ten@@ ths of a thousand euros not - per square meter , well noticed .

by the way : Munich is just not right at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double @-@ time keeper in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a convincing event of the Champions League @-@ season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have sh@@ elled a dream start at the &quot; mission Milan &quot; in the W@@ enk@@ essel of Pir@@ ating .
the team of trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympic champion in hot atmosphere thanks to land@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Göt@@ z hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth Hour success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich on the third attempt .
Müller was awarded at his 28th month in the Champions League of Bavaria @-@ Gui@@ ded Mi@@ th@@ os @-@ Tor@@ s@@ Roberto , who took place as a fl@@ ank d@@ ashed away of the World Championship .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate her , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ ti had promised a@@ we in front of the game in the Car@@ ls@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich @-@ based word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated not@@ ion , not to shine .
Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the Royal class , among them against famous clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled across this site .
yet Bavaria , in seven Europe @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next sacrifice .
they went to some brave they , in their revealed efforts often to inv@@ ent their works .
attacks were diver@@ ted along on left side , on the left side of Lin@@ ks@@ ha@@ el Douglas , which had rarely passed against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more fortunate enough to see his fl@@ ank out of the right hemisphere in the left upper to@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion promised the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first of all , when Olympic @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown found the head of the poles from the line ( 26th ) .
then , by direct order , the Tor@@ s@@ keeper added Roberto with his knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
while the Bayern accommod@@ ated its domin@@ ating game , Pir@@ ating was able to pin con@@ i@@ fers .
but before Manuel I watch for door .
on the other hand , when he le@@ aked a shot of ideas on the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a group with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , based on muscular problems back in the squ@@ ash , was first sitting outside .
the F@@ WC hero had given the green light only after finishing the final training , said sport managers Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to do something else that is quite v@@ icious . &quot;
also at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he produced King@@ sley ... for his frag@@ ile Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
Göt@@ z came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later everything , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller made one better .
before the game , it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ al .
after a smaller group of sometimes argu@@ ed Bavaria fans in their audience blo@@ c , the followers of host Pir@@ ate had prov@@ oked in words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with r@@ att@@ les against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was taken seriously from the stadium .
who smoke , has a higher risk of losing teeth
the one who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lung , but also to the teeth - that puts a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of default , the risk decreases rapidly .
both smoking have a mark@@ edly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to qu@@ itting smoking they found the risk of losing their teeth mat@@ urely , in order to lose the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ che .
scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of dental fall may be cav@@ ities and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ izes DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the link between smoking and gum loss is therefore return to frequent dental hi@@ kes in smokers .
whether it is not clari@@ fied , how much smoking is increased the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking at smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it may take over ten years , until the threat of returning to the level of qu@@ itting smoking sin@@ ks , first @-@ aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich , of the English University of Birmingham .
one needs to convince humans , non @-@ smoking , stated study of the H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shortened the life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads to our knowledge of good health up to the high age .
in Germany , over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 was affected by lack of loss , the DI@@ f@@ E distributed .
earlier studies have already noted that smoking is raising the risk of early release .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .

near the construction site for the new Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ischer Museum Skel@@ ets and rem@@ nants of historical buildings have excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans have been looking for the so @-@ called ground monuments .
the museum has always been moved to the site in Cologne as a department for arch@@ eological soil .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards , the archae@@ ologists have now found the answer .
from text documents , it was already known that a fortress and in the 8th century have had a church , explained a church in Trier .
next to the rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church , a cemetery with around 350 graves have also been discovered , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
in the resolution of the dispute over the Tran@@ sat@@ l@@ antic Free Trade Agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the cont@@ enti@@ ous private exhau@@ sts for disp@@ utes between concert and states are intended to be replaced by a transparent system , which is considerably more traditional dishes in its functionality .
&quot; we want to set up a system where citizens &quot; trust , &quot; Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström said at the show .
the Swedish diplom@@ at has set up the proposal to launch a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP has to develop the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedures will be con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely presented that the EU states and the US chose an independent judge for a new investment .
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the United States and third countries .
provided for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow us to appeal against jud@@ gements .
so far the trial involved together with refer@@ ees , however , were unable to agree with their judgments .
in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in their fair@@ ness and justice , commented at Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , they want to move to an International Investment Regional Court .
there , for example , there could be disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries .
particularly high @-@ performance economics conditions ( IS@@ DS ) will be considered one of the major reasons for major resistance in Europe to TT@@ IP .
the traditional bit@@ ral courts are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , over the companies permit the tax@@ pay@@ ers of the tax@@ pay@@ ers , to reduce national laws , or to reduce consumer and environmental standards .
in the first positions , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as camp@@ act submitted the proposals of the EU Commission as in@@ sufficient .
critic@@ ising from all that they did not apply for the already issued free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German Ministry of Economic Affairs , Matthias Mach@@ ico ( SPD ) , described the plans as a major progress .
the Commission had taken into consideration substantial points for the reform of major points , former Austrian Minister for Finance Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade minist@@ ries .
the old system of private bit@@ es was come down from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned about changing the individual possibilities of economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , whose name was .
when the talks about the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ l@@ antic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded well on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , Invest@@ ors &apos; issue has not been discussed so far with the USA .
originally , a frame for the agreement should be concluded at the end of this year .
this date is no longer sustainable .
del@@ ik@@ al folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is sitting on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the shy being played the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , which is about 40 people , is almost taken by Stev@@ ens lecture .
he tells of several places he always records on the map which he will always report about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and tender @-@ arranged songs .
where they arose , and how it looks like there , in his home .
since that time , Stev@@ ens has been working as a wonderful creative enjoyment .
with the 2003 released and third album , Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear wis@@ ely composed songs which can harmon@@ ious very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties but at any time it can finish great opul@@ ent drift .

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n made his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fre@@ igh@@ ting
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ h made his debut at the opening of the Prime Minister with tension .
the new Labour MEP Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ger and on the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is proud to launch the first of his six couples shortly after lunch , with the media probably being evaluated by the media and the Labour MPs out of the near future .
he challenged &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p several sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n leadership , because she is on Tuesday following his appointment as a member of the scrap@@ ie qu@@ int@@ et and following his speech at the TU@@ C Conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime , Labour President &apos;s decision to remain at the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday at a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain and stands at the centre of several cover page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ no &apos;s decision not to sing the national hy@@ mn , has caught your attention .
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; played &quot; in respec@@ tful st@@ illness &quot; and he recognized the &quot; Hel@@ per of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour chairman in the BBC , to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ns , regardless of his belief that the monarchy would abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of the shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and she calls for differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him as leader .
the BBC @-@ based political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences would be st@@ acked within Labour &quot; by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n utter@@ ances to the European Union and the limit .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , the TU@@ C Conference said Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the sha@@ dows of work and pensions , said the party &quot; is very clear , &quot; that they may only be against the government plans to lower the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ on 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the fifth Labour president , David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory leader in the last decade , on the Disp@@ atch Card in the Parliament over the past decade .
the Labour president , who promised another policy approach , says that he has been &quot; Crow@@ d &quot; sour@@ ced &quot; Ide@@ as for Questions with Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 comments .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the leader of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ative and that it will under@@ take both &quot; impact resistance &quot; and spreading mil@@ king with obstacles and instead demonstrated to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle , the shadow trade minister will represent him if he does not take part - for example if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into being speaking that other colleagues occasionally seize the Word and that he asked John Ber@@ cow , spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became the leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced that he would remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ The@@ aters &quot; who often is closely associated with the Prime Minister . however , a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , Fra@@ gran@@ de was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his position under his par@@ liament@@ arians , even though critics were argu@@ ed that they had become a caric@@ ature and require further reforms .

the pound has increased by more than 1 % from the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the Riv@@ al AB In@@ Be@@ v arrived .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ ì@@ j@@ ovice , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .

at the moment Mon@@ sie@@ ur Bie@@ ber is located in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns out .

the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans went up Justin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria in Poland .
from 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ k is sitting on the cold stone pl@@ aten of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .

met@@ eor poster gives Lebanese on the potato @-@ bass @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it &apos;s both - and in the potato d@@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ al owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the saying &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the p@@ ic movement , Al@@ hay potatoes and meat put together on a s@@ ke@@ wer .
the idea brought him to the idea of a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes and D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen acci@@ dental on TV .
since then , in his shop there has been a barbecue s@@ ke@@ w , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; it is multi@@ coloured for the stomach , &quot; Al@@ hay thinks .
the idea of Lebanon have been registered in the patent office in Munich in the meantime .
according to the agency , it has recently been protected as utility models .
how much flesh and how much potatoes of the s@@ ke@@ wer contains , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to tell .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds .
also with its customers the culinary international agreement come well .
Met@@ cash re@@ stores Land Dis@@ miss@@ al campaign for elimination of alco@@ hol@@ ism
met@@ ering is trying to protect IG@@ A locations in front of a Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers met@@ al@@ ers has launched a fall@@ back campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A reta@@ iler in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets have prepared their relationships with local food vendors and build the brand IG@@ A through Ma@@ instream marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A res@@ eller and suppliers jump on board , with stamps like ice manufacturer Simm@@ o from D@@ imm@@ borough that distri@@ butes samples and shop @-@ owners in IG@@ A stores and sell tickets for the South Australian football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that met@@ cash will be publishing further details of its Defence Strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers of food , alcohol and devices will carry out its annual investors strategy .
it is much at the game , because South Australia and Western Australia almost make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously Provin@@ cial and IG@@ A reta@@ iler feature a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - over 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts as Morgan Stanley takes some five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent single tra@@ ders .
according to a report published this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley said that IG@@ A reta@@ iler will lose $ 360 million in terms of revenues per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di is opening 25 locations in SA and 30 in WA , and generate annual revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and grocery , and with the amounts on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high facing charges could cost to $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey carried out by Roy Morgan that IG@@ A buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stanley takes care of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and to reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business meeting in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would probably be able to van@@ ish within a decade .
Met@@ cash dis@@ agreed to react to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ A &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has about 1,200 IG@@ A reta@@ iler , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction in equal pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers we@@ ars and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ to create selling prices with Col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths about hundreds of products each week to improve their shops selling fresh food and provide a better choice of private @-@ label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s major Managing Director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the wholesale prices and charging programs are to be aver@@ aged and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; in the recent storm that year@@ ns about his friend Nick C@@ aly and ear@@ ns recognition as criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is always referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; and became the in@@ famous cont@@ ention of C@@ yr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the French Masters over the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent , Ryan Harrison twice became separated by the refer@@ ee , choosing Harrison . &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have had to suggest that I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp made a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended from He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing that I am very jeal@@ ous of me is the fact that after my view , Than@@ asi was a little in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken up a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a cr@@ amp@@ er in the US Open , but he is not the first player to make a bat of fru@@ stration among themselves , and I know Than@@ ah , to know that he is not proud of them .
but , really , he really beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even amongst the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ved much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around itself , and I think he was a little too aust@@ ere .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he goes in the team and so on he has never worked a problem with the other players he is hard , he is good in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own services .
He@@ aly also supported the decision , C@@ yr@@ gios at the important decision to take into account that begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everybody , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long lasting element to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is entirely focused on the competition , and not all the contro@@ versy around &#91; C@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick has managed to get the ascension which people like Feder@@ er and Murray does . he asc@@ ends to the eyes of the public , and he deserves to support him , but we try to think him , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explained Not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary explained the emergency and un@@ lock the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and was holding all those who tried to get illegal into the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos has acted on the border , hundreds of migrants who re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded with indig@@ nation .
the people who had fled from violence fled for an unknown period in a land strip on the street between the two controls of the country , and built @-@ up tents , and settled there .
but fru@@ strations got up .
when a police helicopter sli@@ pped over them , the migrants &quot; op@@ press the fron@@ tier . &quot; and they cried out ins@@ ults towards the Hungarian Stand@@ by police .
some seems to be back from protest food and water .
declared , &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; there would be &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece are arriving .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ ally damage .
&quot; I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic said in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a str@@ atum meeting in Brussels .
the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the floo@@ ding Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement was achieved that the EU states would take another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the crisis in the continent .
Hungary however did not win its hopes for an early action of Brussels or his neighbors .
the emergency was proclaimed on Tuesday in two southern regions of the authorities for more powers on the crisis of the crisis , so they could accelerate the streets of dismant@@ ling and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also plan to plan a bar@@ bed wire along his border to Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants across the country , after having a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even v@@ ascular insurance companies were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the past months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point into the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban claims that most of the upcoming economic refugees that are seeking for a better life and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly in contradiction to other EU states , among them Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight , crossing the border or the dam@@ aging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us , to put the government along the southern border with Serbia into a crime . these laws also put heavier pen@@ alties for condemned human tra@@ ders .
&quot; as a result of the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the state of emergency , &quot; said government speaker Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree with the use of the military , which is expected to be next week , but rep@@ orters of Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security adviser for Or@@ ban , said the government 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had been lowered into the country .
they come over by damaged by the fence , they are now in custody , and are accused of off@@ ences of criminal off@@ ences according to new laws .
authorities are fast to repair the fence .
in the morning , on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border @-@ dives with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the limits .
chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hung@@ arians joined a small office in a metal container , in order to process the data of man and squee@@ zed a crowd around it .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants were blocked the most important highway combination between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would stay food and water until they may arrive to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a National survey
the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders are oppos@@ ing the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate in the preliminary elections ( 58 per cent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not declared he has been proclaimed by the Presi@@ dential Guard , will receive support of 15 percent of the general elections for the presidential elec@@ torate .
more than five months before the pre@@ elections , most of the democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion exists , which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ t Supp@@ orters are more constant in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton lost some demo@@ graphic groups in a series of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders gains some profits .
Clinton receives a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these jumps have decreased .
your support with men is significantly dropped , and S@@ anders are just returned with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage of democratic elec@@ tors under 50 years is vol@@ atile and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
however , Clinton had a big advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton had a second @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the Democratic voters of the presidential elections show that they would support the Clinton &apos;s enthusiasm when it was nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the can@@ did@@ ature .
six percent would not support them .
maybe it is not surprising that Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters seem to be thr@@ illed by her .
the views are stronger with the ones that currently not support Clinton - only about one quarter it would support her .
while 48 percent of the elections are likely to say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer republi@@ can voters do this on their leading candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ t &apos;s supporters is in an open question , why they want it to be the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
because of Clinton &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
consent to problems with problems and the electoral strength are also quoted .
since the vice @-@ president claimed a potential for the Presi@@ dential Address in the Wa@@ ag@@ shell , 57 percent of the Democratic voters want him to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it .
if the choice of Democratic voters are asked who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is on top .
by Clin@@ t &apos;s followers , more than half know that Bi@@ den would put her second choice far from S@@ anders .
decides not to can@@ do not raise the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , the Hillary Clinton &apos;s margin increased from S@@ anders , of 20 points with bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
just fifty @-@ five percent of D &apos;s Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning choice ; however , this figure has fallen by 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ fis@@ hness &quot; has risen .
however , in the question of what is more important at a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about voters .
similar to last month , no single new candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate is un@@ acceptable for these voters .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features in elec@@ ting the pre@@ elections of their party .
am@@ big@@ u@@ ity consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
at the three candidates , Bi@@ den talks about hon@@ esty when Clin@@ t &apos;s Leadership is in strength .
thirty per cent of D &apos;s voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that more than S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have an opinion of him .
Democratic voters of the preliminary elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions of Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continued during the ten@@ ure as Secretary of State , most of the Democratic voters are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions did not affect their opinions .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public .
half of the Americans are not satisfied with their explanation , whereas only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the issue had come to light .
most Americans said that the E @-@ mail contro@@ versy did not have effects on their general opinions of Clinton , while 36 percent said that their opinion may have wor@@ sen@@ ed from her .
they are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views from Clinton become worse .
despite the fact that Clinton is viewed by the voters as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , it is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less than in May .
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voting rights also see tr@@ ump than not honest and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and tram , however , receive good notes at leadership .

Ben Car@@ son is located at the newest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times behind Donald Tr@@ ump
on the two candidates , half of the support will fall in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republican voters support nationwide sur@@ pl@@ ump in large numbers . support of 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month was 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sh@@ red from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also yiel@@ ded that Car@@ son deals perfectly well in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ pl@@ ating the Com@@ ump of Republican voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio , John Kas@@ ich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who fell to the deepest , namely from 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida Governor Je@@ anne Bush , former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio take 6 % on the third place .
the error mar@@ ge in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of rep@@ ublic@@ ans in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey which was published last week shows that Car@@ son enters the p@@ olls - he arrives at 19 % support for the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the latest @-@ time survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed no ump distinc@@ tly Car@@ son .

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ing bur@@ dened
almost two years after a student died during a cha@@ ik@@ ous rit@@ ual , a student community in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , will su@@ e suicide attacks against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta P@@ si @-@ B@@ si capture , Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g were brut@@ ally brut@@ ally attacked and delayed by his transport to the hospital , which led to his death , divided the police .
civil servants said he had been bur@@ dened with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound pack full of sand , and repe@@ ats , while he tried to pursue a frozen field on a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about heada@@ ches , and then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood call not the call number 911 , after Den@@ g was s@@ wo@@ oned and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing to get his symptoms on goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , the National President of the Brotherhood , to bring advice , and said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood started to hide , and the welfare of the bro@@ therhood were fundament@@ ally cared about by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; says Poli@@ mark Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeated with p@@ umping force of injury to head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sch@@ ists of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the Sch@@ ik@@ aman for every year , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members need to be held accoun@@ table ; and this step of authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment due to murder , for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with anti @-@ inflammatory attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to take part in the participating individuals , but if there is an organization that has - officially or un@@ officially - this has been sanc@@ tion@@ ed , so we will also engage in the account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College was banned the Brotherhood and the Brotherhood has appe@@ aled to the local Brotherhood .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
an interest rate hike will come , and the car@@ et@@ se is going into the wan@@ ing , R@@ end@@ ites for bonds will rise , and the economy will gli@@ de into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long this will take time and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history for the economy offers only small guidance on the flow .
a recession came in within just 11 months after the first interest rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising the interest rate is often , if not always , a factor in which the economy and financial markets react .
hence , representatives of the US central bank under@@ st@@ resses that investors don &apos;t focus on it when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period which is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a part .
at the end , market participants may determine that the whole excitement is possibly exagger@@ ated because of a rate of interest .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ it@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to clients .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still on low level to deal with the seis@@ mic shock which seem to be a lot to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based look on how some areas of business could react :
as the market has seen last month , interest rate hike can be vol@@ ati@@ l for a while .
once the increase is hits , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency to rise for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which is perhaps again reflected by the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analy@@ tics in a recent study , what happens after interest rates of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days after that , with an average return in the past six past cycles , by 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , chief unit strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s Asset Management .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stocks are down@@ turn later on the enh@@ ancing cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate hits you often promote .
in the current case , the F@@ ed has faced with some conditions , which there was not before and could accelerate the recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is in the vicinity of its lowest point in an interest rate hike of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rates have been around just twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , it is likely that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter following the sales of the Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest rates at a so frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and dis@@ card the question , &quot; whether it is different , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants voted for an interest @-@ rate hike of the F@@ ed year , and all eyes were judged to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC may have an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; in our study , all high @-@ speed cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing vibrations in GDP and before rec@@ ited against rec@@ essions quickly after the beginning of the recovery in the sha@@ dows , &quot; says the report .
by contrast , this is a very slow con@@ i@@ rest of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been only 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ atile as the market share an interest rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect in bonds is faster than in shares when they change its strategic course .
when bonds , R@@ end@@ ites seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease is carried out in the cycle .
at the end of the enh@@ ancing cycle , announ@@ cing life fell straight , Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist by Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in the interest rates are likely to move closer and decrease bonds between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a de@@ fl@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest rate bonds often produce a better result in such climate although &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come @-@ An@@ al@@ yst@@ in , in Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
interest@@ ingly , Jones doesn &apos;t know that markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adjusted for the prospec@@ t of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest have increased , the cost curves have increased , and vol@@ atility has increased - all the market &apos;s characteristics when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in large and whole , companies that pile up the greater part of their business activity into the US will benefit if interest rates rise and attractive local products .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts are worse because an increase of dollars will make their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debt .
&quot; the story reveals that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to respond positively to an initial interest @-@ rate hike , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet demand more than 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital gains as well as low vol@@ atility at their shares have also over@@ seen their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt become a major problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure bank games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
as@@ par@@ er could see profits through higher yields , even if experts have in different opinion , how fast this will happen .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham
the Conserv@@ atives critic@@ ised the caster for his &quot; negle@@ itation &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is increasingly opposed to commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she was im@@ itated only The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins res@@ hold the Voice of The Voice to and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claimed a leading par@@ liament@@ arian and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do something that does not have a private station .
con@@ serv@@ atives to Andrew B@@ ingham said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the publicly @-@ legal radio station , &quot; ev@@ um@@ ing &quot; and increasingly do not be able to differenti@@ ate from its commercial competitors .
radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; ev@@ oked &quot; but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seems to be only under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples in which you actually want to im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
the BBC @-@ Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far off his commercial compet@@ itor when it comes to the public at live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;ll learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and making music that &apos;s really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to put new works on behalf , I really hold for importance , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller , Alan Dav@@ ey , argu@@ ed that the tou@@ g@@ her had to re@@ juven@@ ate the audience , as it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport , came under fire , doing the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins res@@ hold The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , who was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Richter - was produced on a special BBC mode .
he added that , &quot; he wishes to find &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; when the next time a entertainment series is set .
however , he refused to close the order from further rows of The Voice in the future , or give money to prayer providers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at slow@@ est and black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
the last month was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones ,
experts believe that Black Friday lost the issues in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping was dr@@ illed , and many of the UK &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities .
yet experts say that there are now signs that the online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
overall , the expend@@ itu@@ res for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with just five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that stag@@ n@@ ating online sales after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G @-@ proceeds in the Guardian .
he declared that the online sales began three years ago , when buyer continued to make purchases with their cell phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , such as at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uted , and we may probably experience that growth is decreased .
the Black Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for having reported sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their shopping before this event , which will take place on Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computer to make their sni@@ pp@@ ets , and some dealer websites have been tum@@ bling off .
experts believe that Black Friday won the purch@@ aser with them for bre@@ wing them , purch@@ aser might be able to make purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 is printed online a little over 1 £ online .
some products such as TV and laundry are carried out more than one @-@ third of purchases now through web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of people &apos;s clothing and shoes buy online rather than in the fashion chains .
Muslims buried the Muslims in Mec@@ ca near the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tion@@ ed
the bodies of 29 deaths are held by Muslims in the first tra@@ itors of Mec@@ ca by roads .
Saudi Arabia signs the Coll@@ ap@@ se of the giant Saudi Bin Laden group to the burden .
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed
hundreds of Muslims were gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury the dead , killed as a crane in Mek@@ ong Central mosque .
filled with mour@@ ners , largely dressed in white , the circuit to declare their respect , when the first of the dead arrived their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m Cem@@ etery .
the funeral proc@@ ession went over to the Holy site , where only days earlier a building crane crossed the ceiling of the mosque and then top@@ pled on the slopes .
the bodies were released for bur@@ ial , when Saudi King banned from the family bin Laden &apos;s construction companies because of the catastrophe , which imposed also 3@@ 94 injured persons .
the bodies of 29 farmers killed when a crane collapsed through the Great Central mosque Mec@@ ca , and were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram was found of Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who had arrived on his first pilgrimage to the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents in front of the annual H@@ add@@ an in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already promised that the p@@ add@@ ons to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to grow to the city will continue .
today , King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group would not have been standing the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of decree , published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden group is responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership needs to be forbidden from abroad .
at the start of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , that crashed into a courtyard of the major mos@@ h@@ che , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims come from the p@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month .
the bin Laden group published no statements about the collapse of Kran@@ j and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also invited the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it is not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes in the Mec@@ ca &apos;s largest mosque in part of the massive building project led by the bin Laden group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected with the Ash@@ er@@ im family of Saudi Arabia and takes over bigger building projects .
the late @-@ born leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a Ab@@ ru@@ ined son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ 80s .
the crash of the crane collapsed in the middle of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once a lifetime of any healthy order .
officials told that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials noted that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to pay at the relatives of the paid and the same sum at the last one .
other injured gain half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that time of cheap East European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople is over
Brit@@ ons increasingly employ crafts@@ man , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has a rise
this leads to the establishment of 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at art@@ is@@ ans
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q will close sales nationwide .
Ru@@ pert Steiner , City leader of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Britain will conduct their h@@ ammers and brush in favor of the use of qualified East European tra@@ des@@ people who perform works in their home .
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to a brush of walls , these days apparently belong to a minority .
because British do increasingly employ people to perform DIY jobs in their homes , as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new president of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree @-@ gra@@ ined chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , who offer services to low prices , is now out@@ dated .
thus , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open a 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix shop which will join the art@@ is@@ ans and close to 60 outlets from the B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , than eight of ten buy @-@ decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment , men conce@@ aled the men .
it said it was necessary to set up the growing demo@@ graphic trends that exhibit more female single @-@ households more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this stronger into equilibrium .
basically , half of our customers account for women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in decision making .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in an FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also changed their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is nearly the only company that has occupied just 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - great diversity here . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and par@@ agra@@ phs after the group had closed the costs for closing the stores .
due to the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open up 200 new branches .
I / DO@@ B officials for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at Kl@@ agen@@ furt State Court , on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball tournament a@@ I / DO@@ B will have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and public pro@@ curement .
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged with administration purposes .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , had been observed in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 had allowed funds of club meetings to which they had been able to di@@ spon@@ ge in their functions for private purposes .
damage is estimated with about 400,000 Euros .
sporting activities are also charged with financing .
the fact that the President of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ en@@ ats , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , retired from this fact .
it should be negotiated for a later date .
for the par@@ ach@@ ute of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence , that the association had not been a property there at no time .
the sports functioning could only have been b@@ illed and the sports club , for which it worked from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money , issued out of the debt - the liabilities were approximately 600,000 euros in 2001 ( approximately 4@@ 4,000 euros ) .
&quot; back then we stood before the situation : &quot; we continued the club or let us put it ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bre@@ ather of the bre@@ ather of the finance industry .
he then , with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shed money , put our life insurance as security at the Bank , &quot; he said in attendance .
be agreed with the association : you can manage the money free , no debts must be made .
moreover , for the appropriate financial success , payout Per@@ pet@@ als have been adopted retro@@ spec@@ tively by 1991 .
therefore , as a result , it was only years later that a plus on the account had been un@@ paid .
the Pack@@ ages also included in detail and not detail reviews , former ob@@ taining the former ob@@ sol@@ es .
the accounts and savings are administered by the two def@@ endants , the second def@@ endant said .
why the payments from the association were not present in detail , the judge asked .
the association is not interested in detail for financial lovers , is important to only have freedom of debt , such as the answer .
by 2011 , when a function@@ ary investigation began for a function@@ ary investigation , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was referred to the association onto the association .
those were back , the def@@ endants appeared .
this securities issued in the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
the in@@ quired long no answer .
then he thought , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something happens , no one would have known anything from this money , the public prosecutor was in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed of the function@@ ary .
this bank was form@@ ulated as &quot; damages . &quot;
why dam@@ aging damage ? , Judge and Public Prosecutor requested .
the first def@@ endant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , since the association was never mis@@ experienced .
but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; with this you are all from the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; Am I a legal counsel ? &quot; he asked .
moreover , the function noted that he never paid a cent salary , he only counts kilometres money and di@@ ets .
after di@@ ets he got the charge of 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenses have been much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the def@@ endants .
these may be evaluated according to an operational practice , in which everything was judged correctly , no longer have been kept , declared it .
o@@ ed benefit also included the second def@@ endant .
all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

as part of its restructuring , the US technology Group has plans to disman@@ tle the exploitation of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its company of corporate clients .
this means that the company had to be saved in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion Euro ) , the company divided the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of about $ 2.7 billion , which will drop in the fourth quarter .
the mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed since three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year there were still around 30@@ 2,000 employees .

time of decision on interest rates for US banknotes
the world is watching when the US music bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reuters , found out that a little more than half the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will continue to do this now and interest rates will remain at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it &apos;s a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est was placed on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may assume the zero @-@ area and re@@ alising a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ st@@ iti@@ ze , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is based on a relatively good level of power , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less@@ er outlook on global conditions .
she warned the markets , changing to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds are good against such a step .
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 20.00 o &apos;clock on Thursday
death @-@ Det@@ ached at the Delta State University
after the shooting and killing of his girl@@ friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague to say that he wrote him &quot; sorry for the first murder and wanted to do so &quot; he could not do it , &quot; gave the authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social scientific education at Delta State University , called on the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , he shot at someone and killed him .
after which the police employee testified , the police had to send police officers to his home .
he said , &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; would be in the house but won &apos;t be excited , &quot; but probably excited .
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not suffer him .
lamb gave no explanation for his kis@@ ses .
when police operated the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , and said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to do it .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , some 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing them before he eventually took his own life on Monday night when police cont@@ acted him .
chief President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knows nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ p Ide@@ a . &quot;
in spite of the reports on Monday the Lamb believed that Pr@@ ab@@ iss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , &quot; There is no information , no evidence , &quot; for an &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss was described by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who told she had been married about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were separated 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a daughter who is 19 , and it was destroyed &quot; in the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had his daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ un@@ iss , who possessed a dog named Light@@ ning , hit him with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les
the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police officers arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lamb rode his car to the side , fled at foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
lamb obtained a Ph.@@ D. from Delta State University in spring 2015 , as its en@@ rich@@ ness is available at the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ term : Lufthansa building up the Group
Lufthansa plans to expand a large group of group .
in the year , the Lufthansa Group wants to save a half billion euros in a better organization .
the group &apos;s 150 executives will cost the workplace to the workplace alone .
with the pilot mechanism , there are in@@ tra @-@ new negotiations .
the Lufthansa building up its business structure and evalu@@ ates budget estimates .
the goal of re@@ organization was a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year , of cost and earnings sy@@ ner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will not be a member of the passenger for passenger transportation .
the short return line euro should be developed as independently as possible .
in the managing team headed by Chef Carsten spo@@ hr in the future , Karl Ulrich Sh@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
with the re@@ launch , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ s@@ wings to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
to date , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the flight lines under the roof of the Air@@ line Group , which will provide three quarters of annual sales of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
the negotiations carried out by the pilot house of the pilot house cockpit ( VC ) are to re@@ plen@@ ish the negotiations following the tribunal opened on this Thursday .
this divided the union .
the topic of conversations should be the place of retirement for the pilot .
cockpit wool &quot; comes in a year with a projected record result &quot; faster possible results . &quot;
the conflict between Trade Union and Air@@ line led to various strikes during the past few months .
background is besides the trans@@ itional provision of the pilots , the &quot; Wings &quot; concept .
it fore@@ sees that Lufthansa will be bank@@ rolling off the Group &apos;s own budget line for competitive prices .
the painting of Le@@ ena Kru@@ ger will see the artist &apos;s house under the title &quot; Dawn of the South . &quot;

male Shaw by Manchester United can &apos;t play for months in double Fra@@ ktur ion .
after the Champions @-@ League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven , the champ@@ ions of the PS@@ V , Eindhoven , fought twice .
while this left the left eye def@@ ender and un@@ lock it for at least six months of play , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Shaw is able to play back in this season again .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack of H@@ é@@ x@@ Mor@@ eno , in the 15th minute , after the 20 year @-@ old Shaw was broken in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he was then transferred back tomorrow or maybe one day later , then I have operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy that comes with 18 to Manchester United , it really is hard to play , and then is happening .
in the cabin he had an oxygen screen .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double sentence , it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the hanging of a penalty of eleven .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al believed that Italian arbit@@ rators had v@@ ast@@ ly er@@ red .
you can judge for oneself if I say that a el@@ f@@ meter and a red card had become due .
it was really bad attack with both legs .
a review of Sha@@ ws account sounded : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe what I broke , my way to the event begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
in consequence : Manchester United has the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat at the PS@@ V
the England def@@ ender has an additional inc@@ entive for the European Championship in France to recover up to the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very aw@@ ful injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place in this sort of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to harm a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very gri@@ ev@@ ous , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; Coc@@ u said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball who was moving in another direction , so it looked like if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad . I feel so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also brought to the hospital - after a oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost .
unless you &apos;re , you are perhaps David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book was called , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , who appeared in 1971 on Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , he writes in a message on the website of the super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it always seems a picture or a message that we have missed . &quot;
all nice and well , except that the following paragraph appeared in Cameron speaking the action of the book , instead , a summary of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details added to enlarge the quite brief original text .
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ orn @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , to see the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , ful@@ fil@@ s their desire to see a real tree , &quot; reads what his name Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el was , and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that would be still susp@@ icious enough : the text of Cameron referred to as the conclusion of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he pointed out to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the local environment through the so@@ dg@@ ings , trees fal@@ sely , Th@@ urg@@ ently @-@ ri@@ ving Once @-@ ler , despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a flowing , car@@ ing @-@ bear@@ ded nature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a helper that the Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in a row .
a Do@@ wning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text might probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons .
super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons was delivered , but there was no other comm@@ end@@ able comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was threatened by the German team &apos;s expul@@ sion , but it is still difficult .
it is a difficult task in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates but is a difficult task , but when you selected the Ka@@ der , the England for the Tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test runs do not appear on my map .
I would not exp@@ el a win @-@ victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in Batt@@ ling sensation , and the joint spirit is strong ; they will bear no sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a young and positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali was developed as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on the test level , it is an option for attack .
my message @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th gives off from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , of course , be hard to analyse as his leader in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ ult are targeted at results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to nom@@ ination , because - and I told it - players are their own best choices .
long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
when he first hits Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he didn &apos;t provide such good achievements , and it caught me not ; he &apos;s above all a team man .
the question , how much time is a test b@@ ats@@ man gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - how Sam Rob@@ son got before him - for Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to return home and for@@ wards .
the only draft you can raise is that England first put down Jonathan Tr@@ oon in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales will come in and he is a b@@ ats@@ man that I really guess .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer thing we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he hit us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must su@@ stain at least the same chances like those in front of him , but this depends , of course , from the effective position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat these Mo@@ ines besides Cook , bringing an extra spin @-@ off Bow@@ ler and received four j@@ icks , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t beat there , and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s rock of cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een might have not performed his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is not a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he re@@ joined as Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns straight away and looked not back .
Z@@ afar West@@ ari enters the cad@@ res as a Back @-@ up @-@ Sp@@ inner , and in my limited use of him he was very impressed with him as a young man .
people may see its statistics on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup failure that collect their hands and the trainer have chosen to youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has done a couple of smart supplements for exercising .
the nam@@ ing of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the n@@ ett@@ est guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experience since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is for the tour &apos;s white ball phase and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can fresh air on fresh air , even if the messages are in line with the previously said .
coll@@ age team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was taking a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team rank@@ ings are not able to determine the schedule .
and you must remember that , as with the players , their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken on a slight heart .
the Bre@@ xit in Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = withdrawal of Britain out of the EU ) could gain ad@@ ence if the economy is moving into a fleet by 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ released new ren@@ eg@@ yp@@ h strategy to meet Britain in the EU , with anyone who has trouble losing trouble with every single day , even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy - Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour or TU@@ C who viol@@ ently crushed the war on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel paint .
a European diplom@@ at fre@@ er pointed out that some member states so deeply stri@@ pped into various crises such as the EU now is and not always from their own guilt , Britain themselves created agenda with mir@@ r@@ ted listen@@ ers and trou@@ bles@@ ome contract changes , which they usually do not wish to be satisfied .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not be able to end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance : climb to summit meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als . a photo of oneself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wishes one out@@ wardly urged Britain in the inside of the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; Leave us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and that the more and more short @-@ term ministers and civil servants come up to the point where no matter whether we remain or go .
German ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a war@@ rior but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look upon his re @-@ election or for his replacement in 2017 .
it is also an ob@@ bl@@ ending force .
Poland has soon become a nation@@ alist Ottoman government , Spain a le@@ ft@@ ist .
it is difficult to imagine that they will move a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its whose energy ought to be used to prevent the withdrawal from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most have been separ@@ at@@ ist ten@@ dencies .
hence , some such ministers also plan un@@ intenti@@ onally , not helpful notes , all in the SN@@ P style , while the UK Embassy in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ dge &quot; and &quot; Britain has not gained any value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how hec@@ tic the Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense and which EU scep@@ tics may not be the Oli@@ gar@@ chie of the press bar@@ ons , as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n in 1973 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may remember the weak Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opponent , who made themselves a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
at all his consider@@ ations , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
for this purpose , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ for@@ war@@ med Sch@@ ur@@ ks , phone dogs and the pseu@@ do non @-@ in@@ foreigners , which have the most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about it , but imag@@ ined that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas to ad@@ ress him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir itself than Bla@@ ir itself when he was opposed to Cam@@ er@@ ons Refer@@ end@@ itions , for Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the non @-@ approved Constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch elec@@ tors in 2005 , that opened it a door door .
the press never did that .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly little can@@ ola on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he no longer need to compl@@ ain about me in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yc@@ ott Mur@@ doch strategy of 80 @-@ s years to repeat , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take place , but it must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ --@@ official position to Europe is - I &apos;ll put it kind of way - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ari@@ ant tendency and the wild cre@@ ens of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ English can probably tell everyone to say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said , when the boy sc@@ out fought in him not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the prov@@ oking John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a sch@@ att@@ endant was a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father strug@@ gled to be opposed to his Labour Cab@@ inet Director , without going too far and lose his cabin job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys Battle was even more attractive .
but to fight , to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell told , nor did J@@ C told his comra@@ des and members after all reports on Monday evening on Monday night .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n will con@@ vey - remember that he has touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right , Cameron doesn &apos;t give a ticket to Europe that allowed him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the essay campaign for self @-@ intel@@ li@@ bility , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental recent am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to the EU membership - in line with her Benn@@ ite Bel@@ fort @-@ Economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past , is no longer a question of the es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
however , like with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ lows is convinced that J@@ C does not leave the campaign to the outlet , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn off political capital - they have also susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this can be meaning@@ less ?
the U.S. is quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government on the power of which I was remembered by a bit remin@@ ded by the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise public Health England report about e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that E @-@ cigarettes are less harmful as smoking was originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined in her report critic@@ izing the methods used by Public Health ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have placed the loading capacity of the data and indicates the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month called the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily Uni@@ versi@@ al Foundation , &quot; based on the P@@ he &apos;s most important conclusion .
two other researchers have asked in BM@@ J and asked whether the alleg@@ ations made &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Not@@ ices Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of its effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 percent less harmful as smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of research and modelling .
in fact , this statement consists of a single meeting of 12 people who were appointed to develop a model for a multi @-@ critical criteria analysis ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision analysis ) - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions about the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine products ; the results of the meeting were conden@@ sed into a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director should have received from British American Tob@@ acco ( B@@ AT ) for an independent trial .
he also wrote references from B@@ AT to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated on the meetings will receive funds from a e @-@ cigarettes supplier , but not the financing that he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reason for selecting the members of the committee will not be delivered , but there are several known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide an industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco wire of P@@ he also took part in the meeting .
the research work of the group is &quot; lab@@ elled &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for most of the criteria for most of the criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , there will be no such connections or limitations in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that &quot; E @-@ cigarettes were considered a way to smoke for little children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that on the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J had already responded before .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his su@@ peri@@ ority .
all pro@@ ofs suggest that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are slight compared with that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique duty to information about the public about what evidence shows and what not , especially if there are so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to the tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System £ 2 billion a year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ er@@ ders , former chief of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ l@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio amount should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast through other UK broad@@ caster .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they may be seen public @-@ legal programmes that probably could see from a smaller audience , to inter@@ rupt their rival to the most popular shows of their Riv@@ age and sen@@ ders as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had attempted to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs can be commissioned or send them clearly by non @-@ subsi@@ dised rival , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communications Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the radio amount , which I don &apos;t want middle or long term for a good idea , you should at least make its production at least for programs that do not make or commission .
they send The Voice to a first @-@ class flight because they want to achieve a possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show it is a joke , it is ridic@@ ulous , it is naturally non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs that may also be financed without subsidi@@ zation .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ l@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I stri@@ ve to see how this will be public @-@ speaking television .
I don &apos;t think that would l@@ essen the BBC anyway .
Johnson , a business@@ man for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC began to blame on her &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are back again what was the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ G@@ gart Conference in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC will sell as East@@ l@@ ders .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal agen@@ ic programs can go to BB@@ C4 as they can &apos;t measure their tasks , and they can argue they go on their apparent missions to a just@@ ification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window , in which no one has ever wanted to see them .
for the broadcast charge Johnson said the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather rainy system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value .
of course , you think we all think that one gets a great value for £ 150 a year , but for those who for the £ 150 is a lot of money , I wonder if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , requested that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educ@@ ate and chat . &quot;
he said , only little bit of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should like to change them in &quot; information , clari@@ fy and chat . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC , should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown and with the commercial broadcasting feder@@ ations go online to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ at@@ ype &apos; can control brain cell through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des are changing the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound imp@@ ul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified systems systems that can be controlled by using sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are al@@ igned with sound imp@@ ul@@ ses , which are to be heard for the human hearing , to be heard .
the imp@@ ul@@ ses are due to switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on @-@ cells that are genetically modified to carry out the membrane channels that react on ultr@@ asound waves .
further on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that the worms revealed the power of a new method , called son@@ ic@@ etic , at the ultr@@ asound can be used to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that a day can replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , developed a invas@@ ive procedure which gives an electric imp@@ ul@@ ses to the brain of Parkinson &apos;s disease for the treatment of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
the stran@@ gely did not react to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani revealed that they were doing it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , rein@@ forcing their ultr@@ asound waves , which penet@@ rate into worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asound le@@ fts work on tex@@ tures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels , and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the lit@@ ters .
the sound waves are the opening of these icon@@ ost@@ als and activate the cells , which they are assigned , such a journal Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled bacteria , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ ans contribute .
when he conver@@ ts ultr@@ asound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are fortified by the micro@@ bubbles and transfer into worms , where they turn on the mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has a number of simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables researchers to switch on and off neur@@ ons with imp@@ ul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tic could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic sensors can hin@@ dered , and can be sent into the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that , with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is possible to temporarily raise the underlying human neur@@ ons in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

they played with the invention of a realistic tender of the company , but &quot; because of the blu@@ ish with bright paints and animation there is stronger . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student halls
11 years ago , I moved to a student dormit@@ ory , but still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the ten@@ der@@ ful smile of those who I &apos;ve been angry - and to the numerous , lang@@ at@@ ones complaints above others .
most of the things I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the move in student halls lasts up to extremely frigh@@ tening up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to draw people : tell you where you come from whether or where you have the Sabbath year , where you have to stand in regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you don &apos;t love to hate them , because seriously , guys , it &apos;s just one yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
you breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it l@@ ends the conversation and helps you to find out the people who like to do in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were fire on fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people leave .
people of people often turn into beverages , film night event venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people accum@@ ulate and their under@@ wear .
referring to : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert a rough handling of the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student dormitories form a room @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture , which is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship , but you have to go away to get away the energy that I consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow weapon is exhausted from soci@@ ability - and send SMS with it instead of knock .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw a few things .
friendship closed through baking .
since you start the university at the height of the Back @-@ mania , the clo@@ ak about the doors of people in order to imagine a plate full of bro@@ w@@ ni@@ es , is less strange when the welcome from the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have a little un@@ pack . so , and now please smile , if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats are a good way to close friends .
her ro@@ omm@@ ates are obliged to enter@@ tained himself , and at the end you may associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a constant b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly missing cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat make people sleep sleeping , when you t@@ p down .
to steal food , there is a certain crime in student dormitories .
of course , the chicken of chicken are an theft , but is it taking a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea too ?
check it with the milk owner .
chances are , they say to themselves , even if they cook indoor within .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , that is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to get well balanced as my co @-@ inhab@@ its who added a deter@@ sive agent in her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is in prison now .
you shouldn &apos;t make any noise , which keeps people from sleep or working .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent man , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ ge belong to humans that sit in the glass .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours , whether it makes them something clear , Drum &amp; bass turn something qui@@ eter because it took three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an examination in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more lau@@ er music .
when they finally ceased at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before leaving their own music shut down their door and went on to her three hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future wife partners would come into the same student residence at random ?
in return , if you keep a co @-@ resident for your future wife partners , take part in her and take part in it every day , and may perhaps participate , how they bring all common friends to herself ?
of course , your heart is taking its own ways - but if a hot compassion dent is definitely not your future sp@@ ell li@@ fel@@ ine , try at least to reason your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has the key in his un@@ closed room has been lying , the fron@@ tier between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing spray can be regarded as it seems .
a good ride is funny , but it only takes some moments until it is a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson over security - but never cut any room &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
shut down your door , and put their keys into a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but t@@ ack@@ et your possessions in the ceiling no more than twice .
ter@@ raced houses for refugees , all @-@ party executives ,
the real estate agency Markus Fr@@ i is built in the middle @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental H@@ ousing Complex for people who don &apos;t have much money .
so for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need living space but also the only one @-@ reaching mother and the ver@@ b operator . &quot;
&quot; I show you still cheap and well @-@ build today , &quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old says in the interview .
thousands of refugees are pushing onto the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Fr@@ i feels to know how swi@@ ft@@ able living space can be created : he builds in one project for refugees in one project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing onto the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Fr@@ i : the main accommodation in containers or train@@ ers has no sustainability .
for people stay in a great part here .
in view of the refugee camp , we also require a sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey town house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a small ter@@ raced house needs a fe@@ west place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
that is different , when people under@@ go to household stuff .
each of the six properties built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say , it is peace again , I go back .
then , the houses can be re@@ arranged according to the appropriate needs .
how high are the costs ?
offer : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
construction took six months .
this is reasonable .
does construction provisions make your plans difficult ?
Gil@@ dner : &quot; I realised my project correctly .
it is especially complicated to make the dro@@ p@@ end value of special construction and the pitch control .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
the apartment is still under way , in which there are three apartments in a ter@@ raced house , needs at least three places .
only in the cities are the space there .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the population respond to their ter@@ raced house ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those accused of being accused of asylum seek@@ ers for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but don &apos;t you spar@@ se the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but were built in luxury apartments that hardly any more could afford .
my project has the message , also the normal people need living room .
not only refugees , but also the alone host@@ esses , or the ser@@ ver@@ er .
I show you still cheap and well @-@ built today .
this is why it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the New iPhone operating system , when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be ordered by entering into the app , click &quot; General &quot; and select &quot; software update . &quot;
when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then to install .
some have stum@@ bled upon the installation , because they get an error message , telling that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to get the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush is returned , or to update using iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has done it more likely through the sh@@ utter of updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you submit a special tool to install apps and re @-@ install it once the process is finished .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during updating or when updating a loading device , so that battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t allow the update being continued because the phone may switch to half @-@ way and that it could lead to a crash of updates .

Croatia : let &apos;s leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; the border checks are also high on our southern border , &quot; said interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
as before , it is clear that everyone who wants a demand for asylum can be made &quot; of course . &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the fore@@ ground .
it is clear , however , that it needs significant signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , not via the Austrian @-@ slo@@ ven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia has refused
according to Slovenia , the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel in the direction of Austria and Germany , and also like to er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees under any circumstances .
yet , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ i@@ bach was not the case .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia become rather the monitoring of the border - particularly to Hungary - intensi@@ fying .
the border with Croatia may be as the outer edge of the Schengen area , however , is already controlled .
as the woman emphas@@ ized , Slovenia has to consider its borders for refugees but did not factories .
&quot; every EU member must fill his obligations ; otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
as the Croatian government announced that the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to travel to the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id border crossing at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id .
the Croatian police captured them in the near maize fields .
since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , among other refugees , meet new refugees .
it was mainly used for Syrians and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
life services and the Red Cross are also in use as well .
in the days ahead , his country with about 4000 refugees , Minister of the Interior , said Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo , on the Maced@@ onian Serbian border , which had previously carried out migrants towards the Hungarian border , reported Croatia to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade decided that it is , the people being wise to take certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor do we want to do this , &quot; it was named .
in any case , according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town S@@ id , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were all around the night of the Maced@@ onian border through Serbia all the time around 500 km away .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has failed , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this means that it might actually be the un@@ predicted shifting of the so far @-@ said member of the Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; extensive possibilities for fron@@ tier control &quot;
Home Secretary of Home O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country for the fall of a strong condition of refugees have prepared the plans for possible exceptional situation .
details he did not name , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member , comprehensive possibilities for border check@@ points . &quot;
we hold rig@@ orous controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen Area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have had a good report throughout the country , affecting the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side the Hungarian border was stuck behind the Hungarian border fence around 300 refugees .
according to the tra@@ jec@@ tory media reports they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to remain completely closed .
if the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior , Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic had tried to calm on Wednesday early at a local eye accident in Hor@@ g@@ os : he stops the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it is currently not for a very high refugee deal .
they could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
assist@@ ants advise immigrants - Dang@@ erous &amp; Alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee aid has already begun to distribute the refugees in the refugees , which altern@@ ate alternative routes across Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area there are even 20 years after the conflict there still no more clear min@@ ef@@ ields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police reported that a team of min@@ ef@@ ields was sent to the border region .

in the past information , the Insider business was to be made to the financial markets .
according to these findings , the agencies have been launched a total of more than 100 million dollars .
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those are ultimately tra@@ pped outside of our regional borders , &quot; says the SEC message .

with this action , the en@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hospitality flour@@ ished with this action on its 20 years of existence and is definitely confron@@ ted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went into the middle of the city and under the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer .
the head of ec@@ umen@@ ical hospitality is at guests &apos; services &apos; as well as questions and discussions how the volunteers are volunteers .
while some password spont@@ aneously put on a chal@@ k and set the sentence by &quot; my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; with the camper , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; not long endure , others remain , say , sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
always at the br@@ ink of small discussions on the action , over life , dealing with dying .

that everyone may not want to open on the tablets , but be understand@@ able , then it was a very personal thing .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ earnings Recovery , Financial Outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the lieder @-@ giant accounted for a whole year owing to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ carrier .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 in seasonal workers on holiday .
at this time in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the market trading and 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year which ends next May , 20 cent lower than at the previous forecast .
analysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , an average of 4.9 percent , and will take effect on January 4th , and despite the higher prices for boat transfer of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said it still expect that the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and due to growth in the online trade will increase .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company believes &quot; solid income im@@ itation if we consider the weaker economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade , into consideration . &quot;
the plans for vacation employment have been announced a day later than the rival UPS , which plans to set up 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional employees , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just ahead of the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to EUR 12.@@ 3 billion .
six out of Z@@ acks demanded an expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority ship@@ ments during the last few years , which stag@@ n@@ ate sales in its unit express mail goods .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
during the last quarter , sales at Bo@@ d@@ cargo ship increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result was due to higher work costs in freight operations .
in the pre @-@ market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares are by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they made 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist spending two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ ony @-@ table , to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade the console .
dro@@ pl@@ ingly about them at an end of the emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story seat seasonal sa@@ ils is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is remin@@ ded that the F@@ ed @-@ president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the Congress : maxim@@ ise the US @-@ Employment and Prices are stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders recognized that there is a non @-@ beaten third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predic@@ t them . it will be announced on Thursday that the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented influ@@ x by the near zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it will continue to grow , the latest turbul@@ ence could increase the already spar@@ c@@ auti@@ ous F@@ ed representatives in the global financial markets , which increase the interest rate of interest for federal government , as well as it is only one quarter of per@@ cent@@ ages .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , &quot; promoted to the Mak@@ ing company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text , the interest rate didn &apos;t increase , increased un@@ certainty around the global market is enough just@@ ification to continue to maintain , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed will do what concerns itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently surveyed by Bloomberg , have predicted a rate hike this week .
financial markets however wait a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator of only a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a decline in the share market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ist eliminated the strike by making them that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average score by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % at 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy pursued the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would take the sentences at that point , &quot; he said .
if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets , so that they were not in panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an interest rate would calm the financial markets , because it would work un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed will act .
even before one month the F@@ ed appeared on track to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow pollution of monetary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of Liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase of the movement .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improvement in the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level required for the F@@ ed as full @-@ activity .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although the inflation remained below the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed @-@ Representative claimed that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and need them because of tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ pru@@ dent .
but the financial markets came together on all over the world , after China had vo@@ iced its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would end global growth .
the market has recovered something this month , and the Dow are now nearly 10 % below the Ho@@ ch of May .
for the F@@ ed @-@ representatives the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred in the last few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former colleague of the US bank@@ note .
now , he predic@@ t that at least one month will wait to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; there are a lot of un@@ certainty in what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is none of the main signs of the F@@ ed , therefore they should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency agency has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the she@@ er indication of the former Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could refer to its mon@@ etric expansion , &quot; spar@@ ked confusion of confusion around the globe .
in a world where economies and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , from the F@@ ed @-@ representatives are expected to monitor them not only the developments in other areas but also with other central banks and experts are advised to receive a better understanding of global economy .
her decision making decision is &quot; more art as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for asset management of the firm En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of revision @-@ actions on financial market movements , with apparently not related to economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , voted one of the Federal Open Market Committee , set up for an interest rate hike , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia marked the F@@ ed to reduce their mission rate by 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a notable impact on growth in the US &quot; said L@@ acker .
one year later the F@@ ed @-@ Representative took these cuts .
the F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability just during a difficult crisis as the market collapsed in 2008 , Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee on Bank laying down the Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ence do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the markets are excited , &quot; Poznań said , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not refer to the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t believe it should be ahead of time .

a warm welcome to them , does not go without the engagement of volunteer workers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support the un@@ profitable asylum seek@@ ers in the city .

Brazil &apos;s p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande is promoting food for healthy feeding
the Brazilian organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy in sho@@ cking ways to investigate how important good diet is during the breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who ad@@ ore on fra@@ ctions that have been painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , that give babies all nutrients they need to set up a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers will catch their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should be carried out .
a recent study under the leadership of Robert Water@@ land , professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet pregnant women are actually concerned the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a child &apos;s un@@ healthy eating is able to influence the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he was an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar system .
the planning for the long a@@ waited practice of sne@@ akers at the Bern@@ ward sports grounds step forward by step : in the most recent municipality meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction of construction was blessed without a large discussions .
before , the Committee , inter alia , had decided to apply for a valid legal &quot; exception &quot; respec@@ tful &quot; liberation &quot; from the valid development plan .
with the exception &quot; we used the permit for a special form of the roof construction .
so a &quot; saddle roof &quot; should be built with non @-@ core first and ro@@ ofing . &quot;
background of the planning is the designated use of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; thus we get a wonder@@ fully large southern roof together , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in &quot; liberation , &quot; it again was about the roof ten@@ sion@@ ing , that for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan - should lie below ten degrees .
this will substantially reduce the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan to exter@@ min@@ ate no &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Par@@ ish of the Municipal Council should usually drive restri@@ ctive Agre@@ ements for the request of deliver@@ ances .
however , the sl@@ anting is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the sports centre at the sports centre is a communal project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated at around EUR 2.3 million .
grants are expected from school and lat@@ itude transport .
in the next process the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre @-@ large hall is now being set up for testing .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of staff pull out by P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg as well as to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of Land@@ kre@@ ise , who confirmed the Land@@ r@@ ät@@ no Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
a decision was made by the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were implemented , all of the 50 employees would still be busy at the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital .
the overwhelming majority should be moved with fishermen and the continuing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the staff , who can not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , so called J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the staff are informed of the plans .
triggered the change of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the doctor &apos;s termination at the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic only since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
in the question who should succeed him , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fis@@ her@@ man &quot; came into the game which he had prepared to take over the line and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of October 1 .
in any case , the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au means that in any case , a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the internal medicine , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the interior of gastro@@ enter@@ ology disorders .
over the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board shall agree to both houses , and then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , will definitely be closed in P@@ ei@@ rec@@ berg after almost 140 years .
the administrative district planned for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment has been completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
Land@@ r@@ ath J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , coun@@ ters rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum voters .

refugees need accommodation : study warns of new homes
the situation on the German residential market is t@@ ens@@ ed .
even more refugees seek a paid stay .
the pressure on the residential market is growing .
the social housing is a challenge .
the distribution events on the German residential market have long since begun .
with the incoming orders and job seek@@ ers from the EU increasingly pushing more people onto a market that is now over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with income ear@@ ning citizens over the last paid @-@ in apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be constructed by 2020 .
in this result , a study occurs on behalf of the federation of &quot; social housing construction . &quot;
in comparison , 260@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
this makes 14@@ 0.000 apartments missing .
refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated in the first three months of their stay , as asylum seek@@ ers living in an initial access accommodation .
many of them stum@@ bled on the housing market and lined up in the long qu@@ eu@@ es before the apartments .
according to Stati@@ stical Office last year , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were available .
the negative development of the residential market , however , lies not only in the increasing number of refugees .
the study also accounts significant changes in residential construction in recent years .
Germany S@@ lay a residential pri@@ or@@ ite ago , which is t@@ aller from year to year .
currently around 77@@ 0.000 residential units were already lacking in the metro@@ politan areas , compl@@ ains of Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many working boys were therefore held in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly longer in &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; for the flute market .
in the major cities the number of square metres per capita has fallen back for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing construction &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to boost social housing projects .
such could be wa@@ ive from the property tax , and the federal tax for funded apartments can be suspended .
according to the Alliance , additional control options are required .
the support program for refugee camps of the public bank Kf@@ W already works well in cities and communities .
a good week after the start was Monday evening , with 184 million euros , more than half of the estimated € 300 million have been made available .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free le@@ eit : Croatia and Slovenia in the corridor
after Hungary , practically no passing through countries , more refugees seek their way over Croatia .
Zagreb announces that all the way through Slovenia has access to the North , without the obstacles .
but the route is still dangerous .
according to Slovenia , Croatia wants to communicate to the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ e Interior Minister and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ Land Croatia is still no Schengen area .
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees are broken into Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people were come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RTL .
Hungary had sealed its border with refugees on the day before .
new laws , which came into effect on the same day , is virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous to asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mili@@ anovic explained : &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
people , however , be people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police had interven@@ ed in the morning the first refugees on the border of Serbia in the country of Serbia .
most of them are reported by media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with taxes in the Serbian border city S@@ id .
immediately after her arrival , they tried to walk on the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serb border the refugees aren &apos;t restricted to the f@@ ences .
instead , the border strips have other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ef@@ ields should now rapidly create a secure account .
however , after the closure of the border , there are barely even more refugees .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 orders .
just before the door on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws offer over@@ coming and damage of the mar@@ g@@ inal dict@@ ator as a perpet@@ r@@ ator .
35 pen@@ al procedures were thus initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years &quot; imprisonment and deportation of deportation to five years .
according to information from the immigration authorities , on Tuesday they took part in the newly instit@@ uted &quot; tran@@ se@@ ons &quot; with a total of 94 applications , including almost all - 93 - the highest in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two older people were born .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees could still be stopped .
anyone has , however , practically gave no more view to granted asylum in Hungary .
after an Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
out of the &quot; tran@@ se@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to get back .
they assembled the garbage that tens of thousands of people left in the road@@ side in recent weeks .
locking lat@@ ti@@ ces have been cut down and one of the shooting down in the border area was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself to the goal of this expansion .
Austria , after closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only few refugees .
moreover , the country has intensi@@ fied its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants were still present in the country .
in Salzburg , some 1,@@ 400 people wait for the drive to Germany .
there was stopped in the train from there to Germany on the morning of the German authorities .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
Mayor stepped &quot; Gest@@ ure &quot; on the fron@@ tier
&quot; we were busy after the bridge firm on Sunday , when suddenly ten people stood with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins , mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had surprisingly decided on Sunday but because of the refugee camp with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein finished , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately requested his assistance and took them together with two further hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Na@@ he Pass@@ au .
previously we have opened the un@@ trusted guests only once , with che@@ ers and drinks .
we said the same , we bring them to Pass@@ au with the car .
&quot; this was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N talk .
they were very grateful .
a man did not take it to hand a generous donation - € 100 for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this is very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the stran@@ ded train passengers were diver@@ ted on Sunday night in W@@ els from a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , after the announcement of the announcement that the railway traffic was adjusted to Germany , yet to try over the border .
but the regional train was removed before the border of W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , border crossing are generally high in the course .
the bridge firm with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday communic@@ ated daily , which had previously arranged a mosquito trap - organized by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án are now sending thousands of thousands to us is the logical result of a seem@@ ingly holy policy :
instead of helping in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp , human@@ ity has to ensure that human@@ ity has increased the attitude of Hungarian authorities to support the attitude of Hungarian authorities in the dark @-@ circle of National Soci@@ alism .
suffering from this policy are not only those Austrian who are faced in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
even the refuge have to discover that the &quot; yel@@ low@@ land Land &quot; that they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp is .
it will be a great challenge , in view of the persistent flows and the coming Win@@ ters , to establish a decent condition for protective seek@@ ers .
and there will be another larger - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35,000 winter@@ ly stops
Konrad ago to do all hands with the refugee camp .
Christian Konrad is used to believe that his word has a weight .
the government has used the earlier strong Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set quot@@ as for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first open centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Konrad has already received the grip .
&quot; we have no left homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success .
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , came to see Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; fe@@ at fe@@ at . &quot;
the Interior Ministry spoke , however , on the other hand , &quot; a ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad anticip@@ ates a need of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ arti@@ facts in the he@@ ur@@ igen year .
in order to meet the number in the coming weeks , 35,000 self needs to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are intended to provide the Federation ; 15,000 of the federal government .
should it be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but there is no barrel without the ground , &quot; Konrad .
he has already led discussions with the governor .
these had been added to him , even to create more quot@@ ations for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Ober@@ öster@@ reich , things are going well , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar is also supported by Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Be@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations are the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator also to the ORF @-@ Action &quot; Help as we do . &quot;
on the platform private individuals can offer simple and un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , one hopes to get empty in the winter .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier yesterday strongly critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation than &quot; very high . &quot;
in distress , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ator must have a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the finishing .
for a limited time , &quot; emergency standards would have to apply .
Konrad , to be more successful in relation to the Ministry of Interior , Konrad is standing with his experience .
I am an elderly man , who is not yet telling the truth in his face .
conviction is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier are not causing the republic to cause any costs , as they declared themselves .
their number of employees is to increase their number to four to four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ er@@ olls has not yet been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set up a container on the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz requires a better distribution
no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees are planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , because there is no support for those affected without taking this action , says mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , other sites should be reviewed to their exchange rates .
critic@@ isms of the city boss in the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to contribute their contribution .
hofer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in an extended phone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Josef P@@ ü@@ ehr@@ inger ( VP ) has added a further action to the refugee question on Monday .
See@@ hofer gave me as@@ sures that the German borders are not sealed .
the further journey of refugees in the FR@@ G would continue to be possible .
however , there is the corresponding limit controls .
special extracts with refugees to Germany will not give it any more .
the protection seek@@ ers would however be brought with regular trains to Germany .
for more intense solidarity in the refugee question by the other EU member states .
however , that Austria once again leads to checks from its borders , it is a logical consequence of &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the action of Germans .
the next Run@@ ta@@ stic is a matter of time
the general restoration of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industry Region is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the stock exchange company S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology range .
&quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in start @-@ up companies in the New ship@@ yard , and later , also what are to be moved .
already from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which the price is promising : &quot; the next Run@@ ta@@ stic is just one of the time . &quot;
at EUR 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to one @-@ third of the City of Linz , Austria &apos;s Upper Austria and the Association ( FF@@ G ) .
available at Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2700 square meter resi@@ dual area in the building are rented out , for an additional 40 percent there is requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the arcade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are central .
actually Jut@@ ta Bre@@ her wanted to state a dog .
this project had to cut the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ady : after all , it has now gained a further gain in the form of another business .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , compared to the business , in which it sells bags , suitcase , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything is about ladies gloves of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting at least 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
several weeks ago , it was rebuilt .
&quot; but I &apos;ve been thinking a long time to open a shop , &quot; Bre@@ it says .
the decisive role for the decision was , amongst others , also the Fur@@ la producers , who are home to Bologna , are the idea of a personal location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the vast region of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who own Italian roots .
their fashion interest has been placed by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I stum@@ bled at the most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some woman delight in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , either woman can not respond to the woman .
perhaps this is why a beautiful bag is utilized every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher in K@@ all@@ stadt
the ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s ancestors arrived from a place called An@@ ders .
this property links some more the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for a f@@ ish@@ man .
whether he comments on foreign host@@ ility , journalist and knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential supply for@@ ged the campaign .
and cuts good on it .
it is also registered in the small town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate genes come from .
the New Yorker , with the F@@ ish@@ fr@@ is@@ ur , is a not@@ ch in the win@@ eg@@ o@@ zer@@ a village on the Wine Road .
some times in the 1200 inhabitants are communic@@ ated with him via -@@ heart@@ ed corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Palat@@ ine : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about ro@@ gue .
and what will the vill@@ agers think about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow gets exciting , but are not so deeply impressed by the kind of we@@ ary nature , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the German city of K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary on the place and its famous kids , among which addition Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t have it to the king of your hearts .
although there is respect to the performance of the family , but especially the opinion that Tr@@ ump says &quot; is even a bit of la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ y@@ ese in the circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - leads to a flood : the investors she says .
Tr@@ ump happens in the village of the An@@ gi@@ ver .
the Com@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the future grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers .
the corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate firms were first land of land in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents were not free of tragedy : your wish to return to the homeland , failed on the Bavarian State , where the Palat@@ inate was back then .
he did not receive the ump , because he once had accepted without permission , the director of the Institute of For@@ ced History and People &apos;s Party , Roland Paul , had declared a film release .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rants . &quot;
that is in contrast to the occasionally correct statements of the estate .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a bor@@ der@@ mal dam to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ arity , this is not as lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant k@@ ump of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was an born tr@@ ump , &quot; Op@@ a was born in Op@@ a . &quot; ) .
the win@@ eg@@ ro@@ wer in retired sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so big . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never looked after K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension administrator in Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm menti@@ ons as many K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz came to a visit to the church organ which was generally well approached .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that I can &apos;t imagine the fire of Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
you find it better if he didn &apos;t know the election , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know whether this is good . &quot;
if those who had the age at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like he would have never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting threads than him , &quot; says Win@@ ters Sarah Bü@@ hler .
and as President ?
&quot; it is not my president , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
Wend@@ ell &apos;s film , which was inter@@ viewed for the ump of time , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ ists , even in the US awak@@ ens the interest .

from the hand of the Vice President at the German Alps club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park was granted the award for the Sustainable Tourism Award .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;

a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; has a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be exp@@ elled as a protective zone .

Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson face to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but it has no major shifts in Today &apos;s reviews .
the breakfast show from Nine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull has abol@@ ished the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , served in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this down@@ side of the party seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers as Sun@@ rise was aver@@ aging an average 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities compared to Today 33@@ ,000 .
today , Today launched a slight increase in the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3.000 ) , but its number was behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3.000 ) .
in recent months , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .

this is the most interesting thing happened every morning .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of sta@@ to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thomson .
the new play on a recently wi@@ ou@@ wed father , who decided to settle down with its two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics had asked whether Thomson could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night was answered with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; .
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remains strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and beat slightly the block ( 83@@ 8000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z @-@ show , was moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe , on average , 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour was achieved by The Chase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and during the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 spectators .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as for the second evening of The Chase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will eventually get through at 17 : 30 .

the last three voices : Bachelor of Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets unveiled ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may be un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly obvious who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , who has finally ended up at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , has been sh@@ rou@@ ded in Spain .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give , whether they are the one who received the last Rose .
but when we go with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows in the day before going into three two , you probably acci@@ dentally granted a hint on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood sealed his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women left the ly@@ rical mode , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values , and positive attitude as a reason why they like to be his partner .
however , when the question is asked , &quot; If do you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them both fast - except itself - Mack@@ ay as best partner in Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day of the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought that in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
Sarah stands with both feet on earth , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood are fine to be a pair .
from their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that , last week , you made it clear that Wood &quot; should be one . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m already pre @-@ att@@ ested to him , &quot; she said .
and when she asked who Wood should choose if not she was , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent an impressive job at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some co@@ aches had banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the Bank , as he lost a rum@@ ble as it lost the Aussie Rug@@ by League conver@@ sions on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and even in the current game after a injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the dressing cabin after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies to grin@@ d the mill , he encouraged her .
Tom@@ s@@ ula reinforced Hay@@ ne public in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ reporter cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne is also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ hey , who advised him to forget his patented catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is playing at a Pun@@ t who was re @-@ produced in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian dealer for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne went down to the playing field and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy in 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not present any wor@@ sen@@ ing start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; it was a thing that now comes up , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne made his debut in 2007 with his original debut in 2007 when a pass was in its own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen Gum@@ mit@@ ra@@ ke shooting at protest@@ ers in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police bul@@ ged in a crowd which demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , one official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Bis@@ hn@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Executive officials , said that more than 1,000 protest@@ ers gathered outside a police station , some of which threw stones and fire@@ bomb .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and thrown into the air before she res@@ orted to Gum@@ mit@@ ra@@ de .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not clear why the Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ ke used , from which it is known that they can kill , but traditionally used as less le@@ thal alternative , obviously produced a high mortality rate .
the con@@ frontation was the last in weeks non@@ violent protest in Nepal as southern levels where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ r@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces made in the framework of the proposed new Constitution would decrease their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that want to create a real state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been involved in violent conflicts since the 10th century .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement signed the country in provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that was governed by centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature acceler@@ ates the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature have voted on certain cl@@ auses last week in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weigh@@ ted people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new trial .
it is still too early to tell whether slightly overweight people suffering from diabetes due to weight loss surgery longer than those who do not receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery which has a leading article to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss remedi@@ al operations or obesity treatments , use different methods to minim@@ ize the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and lim@@ iting the body &apos;s own ability to record food .
over the years Adi@@ pos@@ itas operations have been proved efficiently with type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies have been performed in people who have been ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 applies as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compar@@ es two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach acid formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes for people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI among those who under@@ go this operation sank from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
however , the BMI of those who did not include surgical @-@ surgical treatments were approximately equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ go surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was completely dissolved and at 28 % in part .
in contrast to the medic@@ ally @-@ treated group , diabetes slow@@ ed down completely by just one percent , while only about two percent in comparison with diabetes .
in addition , the results were positive with the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ glyceri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; in general better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also over@@ saw the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is considered best below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but these better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not slow the mortality in five years , as the lead researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ kt@@ tom@@ y Group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , increased decreases in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ wave of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study has no survival benefit in surgery after five years , there is evidence of a study of severe people in Sweden that surgery lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was subjected to obesity people who under@@ go a obesity operation to die about 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that used conventi@@ onally methods .
even though the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soo@@ thing to sleep with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower at the lower BMI group , &quot; with the increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking their weight seriously when the patient is at their BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting for too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have associated their bodies with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really difficult . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe cannot record all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Ne@@ ar East fly .
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders called on to stop violence in the native countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the thirty @-@ day refugee crisis during his ten @-@ day visit to his speech in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , and ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances reported , the interests of humanity should be submitted to the interests of individual nations or continents .
he also emphas@@ ized that the response to the West European countries are ad@@ mi@@ red on the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts were engaged in the crisis of the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but meanwhile you have to re@@ consider over long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and true development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he emphas@@ ised .
in the end , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in its countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never been resolved these issues , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commenting on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist bombing of 11 September and caused the US violent response to a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after 11 September , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know his moti@@ fs were good , but he continued violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four@@ fold increase of intake of hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
tox@@ in centres in the United States have reports about an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in children under 12 years of age containing heavily alcoholic strength infection , such as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues generated by hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of reporting the tox@@ in control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children come more and more often to those products , and unfortunately the percentage of them go in an emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children disinf@@ ect@@ ants are visi@@ bly drinking while some do to im@@ press her friends or im@@ press because of a mutation of the social media .
show videos on YouTube , like youth disinf@@ ect@@ ants , drink only because of a budget experience .
te@@ ens have allegedly mixed the disinf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol and alcoholic water to obtain harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ ked .
it gives disinf@@ ect@@ ant with strawberry , wine @-@ confidence and orange scent that are very appealing for children .
hand disinf@@ ection contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
only very young infants may already result in a few rub@@ bers for alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical Director of the poison not@@ icing centre in Kansas City University , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let whis@@ ky whis@@ key , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sy@@ ring@@ es from after strawberry intake &apos;s disinf@@ ection in the school was brought into a medical emergency .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice a bit higher than the threshold chosen by an adult when drunk in an adult when Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated them in the G@@ forced Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah wa@@ iled her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors later over@@ saw them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and pushed the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very fear@@ ful , &quot; says Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ fe &apos;s mother , CNN .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s operating range .
some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were added to death cases by alcohol pois@@ oning .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario for the swal@@ low of corn des@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , which ab@@ stain@@ ed a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
staff of health authorities suggests that the product me@@ thanol contained , a le@@ thal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol that was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York took their &quot; mal@@ a &quot; teacher to pois@@ oning &quot; their anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; according to a police report .

the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn region of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ ne@@ castle in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , and added : &quot; it is certainly to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ ne@@ castle , if it does not play for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , as it increases in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the figure of 5.5 per cent , as reported by the figures of the National Statistics Office ( dating only ) .
in the meantime , employment fell into Scotland by 12,000 , during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the quarter , a figure above the annual UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
commenting on the recent figures , State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ i said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland had taken the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced additional improvements in the Scottish labour market , increasing employment and a decline in unemployment .
drunk free from the process
as the security personnel cannot satisfy the situation , the employees called the police .
only with the use of pep@@ per@@ spray , the officials could take the stur@@ geon in danger .

why I witnessed an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a bit later , except during a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day moved closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it &apos;s true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and often more applications are available as seats , a powerful lot@@ tery take place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is chosen , there will be an emotional monitor .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I developed my own relationship during the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I am not a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ part@@ ability .
this is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it and you will have access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
she spati@@ ally admitted they were &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orters to be present in order to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work is aid against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the show of Podcasts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I cannot say safety that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would consider him a more enjoyable one .
but I believe there is a strong li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is false .
and from this perspective I &apos;ll see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters , to which you can turn aside .
what you will get from me is what it means , a man to die unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police tracking head@@ hunting speaks to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale police was dry when he talked to the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man of Perth , to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sum@@ p@@ tuous water , just a few meters from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday at a house peace erup@@ tion in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , this one was trying to escape the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I am not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making its uniform in uniform , so he turned on a reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; a good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do fun things to escape , &quot; said Senior Citi@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
battle @-@ soccer player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , Cou@@ sins operated his car to the tr@@ ench in order to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspir@@ ated unity to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ sins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to inc@@ ur him and threat@@ ens to finish the racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables in the past year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he raised to the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity Division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race @-@ day treatment , the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy , Fair@@ fax Media said that he &apos;s always trying to do what is best for racing and he himself found themselves under difficult conditions as it went around the positive Kob@@ old @-@ T@@ up@@ take @-@ sample at Li@@ dar@@ is he could not explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months for sp@@ ying complaints and did not want it to &quot; look &quot; to the highly elevated grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I did eat long on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes up at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know there is going on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I said .
I will go home tonight , and sleep well .
I wish to go about the head , and I want my owner to think that I try my best for her .
if they begin to think , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
then I have to think about what I &apos;m doing with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had attracted the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com so that the Integr@@ ity department had attempted to pi@@ onate his stable material .
&quot; prior to eigh@@ teen months , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart said in a room with a man - whom I would ask - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy at Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am an im@@ poster .
if that is the case , they might be fool@@ ed at their n@@ oses because , in trying to write me , they have failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , re@@ ig@@ ning president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ un@@ dry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of its time and still are today .
should that make me feel that it is in person ?
have the RV@@ L fe@@ at behave , and perhaps people are responsible outside athletes responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now .
but now I have arrived at the point where no matter is , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and pushing it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ it levels of the train@@ ers have been set up with the long @-@ going Cob@@ alt @-@ examination in Li@@ dar@@ i and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ lag@@ ged keeper of Black ca@@ viar , called the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridic@@ ulous , &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse broke , which viol@@ ates the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
I must accept the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my employees has put mud on the leg .
it would have happened last night .
it would have happened yesterday , all day , what was like that .
but it had the same day as it happened .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack of the race day . an investigation of the matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who move these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have to go far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .
men after driver cur@@ ses arrested
the police have arrested one man on the weekend following a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and a subsequent record @-@ address in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Murray @-@ Valley highway .
the police said that the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy suggested fight back over Ri@@ vals to Ring@@ ve &apos;s alleg@@ ations
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ized cr@@ iti@@ y at the tac@@ kling his player as an &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting , &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators shall have the Storm @-@ Class &quot; ring fighting &quot; with his team during the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett did a scar@@ c@@ ely conce@@ aled remark of the Storm Team , after his crew had reached the Final Battle against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland were not &quot; too good &quot; in the R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ amy defended the tonn@@ age of his crew and said they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; with the tac@@ kling wine .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team agree , as it means that they are worried , to become defeated by the Storm team .
&quot; it appears again and again - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about the fight , then she told us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we made contact with Tac@@ kles for a real focus , and this has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he probably doesn &apos;t have to get used to get used to it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how it emerg@@ es again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked me from the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and remin@@ ded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ u@@ let St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with a &quot; stu@@ ffed &quot; soccer .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a bill of divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we view as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play , when you got this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so that they can play as they play .
I build stronger confidence , as they say these things because they are a bit worried they have to play against us .
six weeks ago , they haven &apos;t thought of us when it went around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster shows a higher result than the game bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game but is this an exciting game ?
or are there any breaks and no points gri@@ pping ?
for me it is the game boards .
if they mention us , it means that we will be going to meet them in a phase .
the Storm Team got off on this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales will start on next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug ad@@ age
a man , possibly threatening a lifetime punishment due to his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that served to Queensland , was released for a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested the last month after the police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who arrived from South America on V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and arrived in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police find 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly vital punishment for trying to own a commercial quantity co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge of the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the danger of death at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
during the case he has lied to the police on his place of stay .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics Mutter and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security jointly to reach its release .
&quot; after reading the di@@ str@@ al explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a $ 200,000 dollar is a real financial burden , &quot; said Justice B@@ agan .
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to stop him , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against security , under the conditions that he ab@@ duct his Australian and his Serbian Pass to get to the police on a daily basis at the cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ x@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed during six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to draw n@@ anny ladies to the end of pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ lock used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g recorded the girl &apos;s phone when this slept , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , received from which he received a series of un@@ constant pictures of children , sent by another user .
the girl looked on and discovered the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages , and immediately al@@ arm@@ oured her mother immediately .
the police looked after this and saw the five images , then analysed computer , which were found under the address and discovered the &quot; Web @-@ resear@@ ches , which used concepts for searching for an independent pictures of children .
H@@ og@@ g rep@@ lied to the officials , that he would have done it as it would be to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile &quot; in the internet , and he &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are them . &quot;
the Prosec@@ ution E@@ ili@@ es Robertson said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a su@@ cking - that he is addic@@ tive to sc@@ are people .
he admitted that the search on the computer were done by him , but said it was done when he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are to p@@ ma@@ oph@@ ile .
he asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and sending him to send more photos .
he said he did it to attract them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and he wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then saw the un@@ disputed pictures on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computers and Playst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he had .

defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g appears not to appear in the register of sexual crimes , since one can argue that &quot; no up@@ lifting sexual element &quot; would be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael hid the sentence by October to obtain background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted a security deposit in this case but was kept on rem@@ and for hear@@ ings at other still pending cases .

can escape small bo@@ arder crossing to Germany
increasingly , more refugees are taken off the major control point at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks sent out fear of discovery and capture people on smaller mar@@ g@@ inal trans@@ itions .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the federal police said .
over 1,000 refugees have been taken up along the border crossing Inn in the Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot by bridges and fl@@ ashes on the German side .
in fact , they are accepted by federal polic@@ emen and will be for@@ warded to the registration .
compared to the weekly start of the Munich Main Railway station , the Munich Central Station was once again clearly more refugees .
there are some 700 people in the regional capital only until 8 am , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after re@@ launch of inspec@@ tions at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city .
Stuttgart : a prec@@ urs@@ or of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected
met@@ ologist war@@ n of stor@@ rage in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
because of an low @-@ pressure area about Western Europe currently uses warm ocean air in the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) divided into Stuttgart .
the strong deep is the b@@ og@@ ie of the tropical Storm , Henry , who had pulled over the Atlantic in recent days over the Atlantic .
heavy storms and storms are expected in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , it &apos;s still under the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald , also from the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance District , from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
so they climb the sun again on Friday .
the show makes it : the car will show its innovations every two years at the IAA .
2015 is primarily attributable to compact cars , who is currently particularly selling well .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : some 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations were accounted for by the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August this segment .
this is reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence Days March 17th to September 27 ) .
this year , many new compact models and luxury cars were presented between all of the futur@@ istic concept cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest pre@@ m@@ ating for German automobile industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; says Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann to the trade fair .
it belongs to the heart of the brand .
so that the volume model also sold well , the new Astra is also not too expensive for it .
Opel re@@ alizes a kick @-@ off at the highest compet@@ itor VW Golf in the prospec@@ t of a 17 @-@ 650 Euro .
the current Astra is from € 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which the three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines also count .
unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel &apos;s Astra is initially only one five @-@ door Corsa .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also shown at the IAA Motor Show .
and what will be next to the Astra at the International Motor Show more ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra Galaxy Mé@@ gan@@ e .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively a five @-@ door in a conventional and a tuned sporty GT version .
he comes to trade in the beginning of next year , as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : quite new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ branch is willing to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its wav@@ y lines simultaneously fits the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in the range it is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : a new segment in the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
its maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno nation in Europe in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed , the compact model DS 4 , which is shown at the International Motor Show .
outside the designers of the Designer Citroën @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ er laid hands on the front panel . the radiator gr@@ ille was re @-@ drawn and the modified flo@@ od@@ light with LED technology was equipped .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been modernis@@ ed , reducing the number of buttons through its Touchscreen and integrated into Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
in addition to the IAA in the compact class , the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I was at the IAA in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters are human beings
the Federal Constitutional Court put on an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the judicial system Te@@ gel , which has been accommod@@ ated in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners were entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision adopted the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
those affected may even hope for money if they were imprisoned for only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : it was accommod@@ ated in the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary airport Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who , according to his An@@ fo@@ al , had to be placed on the loose , placed in a larger cell .
his criminal complaint was failed because of the question@@ able detention conditions against the country of Berlin .
but the Constitutional Court repe@@ aled the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of the Berlin Chamber , and would return to the case for a new trial .
you see the man &apos;s dignity .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for judicial reasons , only a few days of dis@@ may be author@@ itative for the compensation in question , whether it was a compensation , it was named .
otherwise , &quot; an inheritance of the legal protection of the personality is to fear . &quot;
the chamber of chamber must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the Constitu@@ tions have often also strengthened the rights of prisoners of war in the past .
thus they only said in April of one prisoner for damages because he was naked in a cell .
human rights is , according to a decision by 2011 , also the multiple classification of a cell without a separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday also the Berlin Constitutional Court , that held a prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ ism in a parall@@ el@@ ism in a parall@@ el@@ ism in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs more than three months a day , between 15 and 21 hours daily in the same cell as in the Kar@@ ls of Kar@@ ls .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines in recent weeks , too .
prisoners are therefore kept shut down for 23 hours , increasing the aggressi@@ veness , even to stro@@ kes it should be already taken because of the stra@@ ined situation .
according to information from the Justice Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel were not occupied due to young athletes , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are getting this ! &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany , according to the Federal Ministry of Federal Ministry of Germany this year , according to the testimony of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is capable to res@@ ume a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) shows me with the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we do this . &quot;
what comes to Germany is con@@ veys the following overview .
according to projections , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Germany ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) dwell@@ ings yearly - and for the next five years .
that &apos;s almost twice as much as previously built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space , however , mainly due to affordable rental properties : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments are out of the rental price , and in order to apply these especially convenient apartments are also applicable .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
a lot of little too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to arise and therefore the Federal Government must invest a funding of 6.4 billion euros per year .
consequently , scientists and Federal Minister affir@@ med that there must be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Professional Research , 55 percent of the world &apos;s leaders in Germany can be employed .
however , if the refugees arrive in Germany not systematically asked about their quali@@ fications to help them , Claudia Walter , a project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is important whether they find work in Germany .
labour is the key to social contacts , for appreciation pressure in the admission @-@ group , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ her@@ hardt , a political turn was made : of labour @-@ for@@ b@@ ade for refugees in recognition of work .
whereas before a for@@ b@@ ade was applied for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ du@@ its of the asylum seek@@ ers .
in society itself - even because of the lack of skilled personnel - are consistent , that refugees should be made faster for access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the job market are missing German .
there is no exception until now , there is no ongoing offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often con@@ veyed by personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore , following the view from Thr@@ än@@ hardt to the Königs@@ stein &apos;s creation .
the Berlin school administration has found that only few abandoned parents to give up their children in the Kit@@ ron , it is estimated that ten to 15 percent are all important to gather the family , &quot; says Il@@ ya Kos@@ chemistry , speaker for youth and family at the Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family from the advantages of K@@ ita , the administration offices are in different languages .
should the need of educ@@ ators severely rise by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase capacity to the Berlin Senate - by doing more technical schools .
students without German knowledge of welcome groups are prepared for classes in the countries .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have an qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack in them , says Be@@ ate stun@@ ned at the Berlin school administration .
the German student body estimates that some 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Federal State of asylum seek@@ ers or thought @-@ up studies - the only exception until now Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank ( CDU ) has given up his attitude .
student @-@ giving refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
for refugees with a matter of residence or dul@@ ent , there are no more power after asylum seek@@ ers when they start studying .
the latter get no B@@ depreciation as if they do not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ill persons .
Ged@@ ulative refugees had to have been living in Germany for four years to be entitled to be B@@ Af@@ gan@@ s , to be shortened by January 1 , 2016 . this span applied to 15 months .
but these financing should also be closed , they demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should immediately get B@@ ami@@ ö@@ g .
Islam is going to play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many are the religion of an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually arrange the same rights as they have the churches , and that existing state churches will continue to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
the creation of a Islamic welfare state is also important to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights are obligations also .
thus , the representatives of Islam must unite to clear contact partners and be ready to collabor@@ ate with the state in many areas and to control him control possibilities .
they also include the read@@ iness to go into action against religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , on Thursday vo@@ iced the concern , religious conflicts may also be brought in by Germany .
those who wanted to au@@ stri@@ ve such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately submitted their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; said he said in the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will , in future , will be much more than today a topic of the entire society .
in this way , the controlling society will also change , the breakdown of discrimination and rac@@ ism is urgent .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has since a short@@ age of decade , anti @-@ discrimination and a General Protection Act .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , like the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ ship showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist subject .
similar opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and stakeholders are not long demanding and what international agreement as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism of Germany must commit to reality in the coming years , if the country will stay peace@@ fully and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
according to general , Germany is able to provide healthcare to the so far expected refugees , called Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; in terms of man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said the daily mirror .
however , additional money must be flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , all the trav@@ ellers rely on health cards alike .
furthermore , services could be reck@@ oned with the federal states .
and long @-@ term , it is highly question@@ able to provide so many people with the limited range of performance , which see asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , doctors mainly make the language barrier to create .
previously , the Berlin healthcare scientist , The@@ a Bor@@ de , thus proved resi@@ li@@ fied by migrants compared to their diseases as well .
not only in clinics , as in physician &apos;s surg@@ eries , would not be accepted , demands them .
but a lot of refugees could also be helped with more general medical applications in the emergency patients .
and with another diagnostic glance .
in the refugee camp there are some more un@@ treated persons , and with the young people , there is an HIV @-@ recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance .
but German doctors from their formation were clearly unknown to some other intra@@ - images , but clearly stated Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
the paras@@ ite in@@ fest@@ ation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; and as for the medical att@@ est , even relief in sight is possibly even in sight .
the Syrians have become a sophisticated education system , some of the refugees are even doctors .
however , in order to practice continuous examination , however , they would have to prove their quali@@ fications .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is sick after the bund@@ led administration chamber ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) . most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress condition or depression .
especially viol@@ ates are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study published by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth of Syrian refugee is trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
those who fall in a post@@ trau@@ matic requirement disorder , among others , suffer with the so @-@ called Flash@@ back with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart pal@@ ms and wounds .
other symptoms include sleeping and concentration problems , severe tum@@ bl@@ ance and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms of chronic , an early treatment would be necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees are receiving a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can cause a request to psycho@@ therapy , however the processing usually takes several months .
furthermore , in social offices mostly property worker or doctors , who are not trained in psychological illness , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
these often lead to false ass@@ essments , says Mun@@ z .

Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mug@@ abe holds a false speech in parliament
Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , falling down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the statements made by members of the opposition that they would have been anonymous to death threats and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mug@@ abe in Bu@@ hr@@ uf .
last month they had bl@@ am@@ aged him and interrupted his speech to the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions politicians have received SMS messages on their cell phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mug@@ en@@ es speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not indicated but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , that he said to Mug@@ ir@@ it speech .
the members of the Member States warns that the immun@@ ity of immun@@ ity ended in parliament , and once they leave the Parliament , its parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .

He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 50 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of the restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
in this year , HP will share two publicly tra@@ ded companies and share the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing firm &apos;s hardware and service operations .
the expected value reduction was given to a load of over $ 2.7 billion in the fourth quarter , compared to HP in an explanation .
&quot; these re@@ structure measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who should guide the unit after the separation .
the He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is getting smaller and more focused on HP today , and we have a wide range of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned as ever before to satisfy the changing awareness of our customers around the world .
He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be concentr@@ ating on providing , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such a statement from the company .

FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta telling that te@@ amm@@ ing in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb must stand behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ th@@ ere that it was first September and if his rehabilitation after plan is run , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optimi@@ stic scenario already means that Wil@@ th@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history its participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain .
the great shame about this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate Kn@@ uck@@ le injury and re @-@ reg@@ ained its old moment@@ um during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened with the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone which did not heal well .
this is not a major matter .
it was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his kn@@ uck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from purely medical point of view , but such as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the corresponding risk of another injuries , always when one player tries to return right in the middle of the season .
it also evol@@ ves into an un@@ pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 from Arsen@@ as 157 Lig@@ asp@@ en in the last five times .
th@@ icker image for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 , which experienced most po@@ aching days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but Arsenal assumes that an improvement in the po@@ aching ratio will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you return from an injury , you have a gra@@ dient period , a time when you must strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will succeed in a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal begins his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur this coming Wednesday and Wen@@ ger makes a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ v Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled to Croatia not to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start in art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ c@@ ott .
&quot; I &apos;m trying to stop the balance and the players who need it to allow a small bre@@ ather @-@ break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are continuing through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the slots with the largest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched last season has been launched .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday at the Richter scale , 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn the teaching from the past season with the Champions @-@ League capital against Monaco and will lead far from far hope to lead the club to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is imm@@ en@@ sely , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked for arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship festival : the comedy show , which give us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to what the need for men to open , now still more des@@ par@@ ate than ever before , how self @-@ mor@@ ates among young males prove on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain and it stays three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ors ( CA@@ LM - Camp@@ a@@ ign with a bad life ) announced in 2015 as the year of men , with the aim of putting the culture in question to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the core in the struggle to master this challenge .
a current study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms discovered that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; chances of having doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritu@@ ally healthy friends makes the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communic@@ ating social media , with their focus on substance , the in@@ medi@@ ability of the answer is often more important than an important source of importance .
our digital life have the need to be strong , fun , and successfully to appear , doubled , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what a psych@@ ologist ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values provide ; money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire explained recently , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was , that this focus was on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , who sh@@ ined by the interaction as a friend .
the recommendation of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents at the football gu@@ ill@@ ers in cozy gaz@@ es and the lon@@ ging from Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can rely on each case , even if they are often back to explore fully their feelings .
like a employee of the telephone call , I explained : ... &quot; my conc@@ ei@@ ving role for people who are de@@ pressed and rep@@ ay@@ at risk , really clearly shows how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends could make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not in the position to talk with friends .
the old Rede@@ mp@@ ing &quot; I come on with it &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that happen to me in the sense when I try to offer long @-@ time environmental mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective outside position status via telephone the person in moments of desp@@ air can also help to support the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with him to commemor@@ ate the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , when you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks any one alone , give him a smile and say hello .
it is never known what the difference could be made for friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
meets PS@@ G to help PS@@ G to m@@ ite Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh and Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malmö .
di Maria arrives at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass through Malmö .
here are the Game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh would hold off course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain had its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of its Champions League debut as PS@@ G players who brought the French champion to the way , but thereafter they missed the series of opportunities before they finally increased their advantage , when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball@@ ad in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A takes a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they are not only asp@@ ire to qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a grade of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ s Team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics missed opportunities ahead of their home town team and against the club , with whom he began his illustr@@ ate career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or e@@ ast@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to come back with our opponents as well , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; it &apos;s a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it , we had not yet scored another two goals . &quot;
fishing hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was able to hold on the weekend against Bordeaux in the First League , but was stolen by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian barn was referred to as the man called PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , and he interpreted to why when he ran in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö defense , before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and past to the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would be a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off , hit the stake in An@@ pi@@ ff with nine National players on the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle section en@@ cir@@ cled a serious adversary .
but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed away from Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s colon@@ ists in the 3@@ 4th minute , they had little attacked in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G also gave herself up , with some mis@@ gu@@ ing and bad offspring , not least of which in the first half was pat@@ ated and then abandoned at not less than five trials , after Cav@@ ani had deployed him after the restart .
nevertheless he pointed out a lot more skill when he brought his fellow player to the game , and it was a pass of Ali@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , to merge the Di Maria in a turning shot , which was diver@@ ted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er thus recorded the sixth of the end of the season , after providing a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
this finished all the idea that Mal@@ mo could return to the game , and only an excellent ri@@ cher from Wil@@ and out of no distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result being low before replacing the E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualifying games don &apos;t go out . &quot;
hat off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

so this also made a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the County Goth@@ a .
on the A@@ 71 at Arn@@ stadt , the dream was then gone and gone .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control over the sports car and sk@@ id@@ led into the sk@@ id@@ lers and drove into the ch@@ and@@ el@@ age .
nobody suffered death damage , nobody was injured .
the damage benefits is estimated at EUR 40,000 .
X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented from turning to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi started as summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
Bayern @-@ Bayern obviously stood a few years ago before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , which then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner winner , four times winner Champions League winner , twice Club World Champion , two time European champion , a time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years of FC Barcelona and moved to Qatar to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi said so that he was already in front of the summer of 2008 at Barcelona &apos;s farewell .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything , we didn &apos;t talk , &quot; he tells .
and the registered version of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw have wished to have me . &quot;
in memory : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not changed
but the bill did not occur .
and the for@@ l@@ one man currently works for the German record master : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola on the contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; P@@ EP has told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t believe the team without me . &quot;
&quot; that made me get dressed . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 would be tim@@ ed with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood at the quarter @-@ final of the Champions League against the Bayern over the entire distance on the La@@ wn , switched the red flag ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the Royal classes triumph at the end .
Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film create
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ co@@ film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown as a discussion on the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a result of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown found this the need of alternative perspectives and , in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the elected script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do it in the score of the film and not by occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on .
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked by offensive dis@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actors received from The Mar@@ tian .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to add people to think about it - who will always be the director , like she wanted to treat the character of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear Friends People has set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing in the film ; Dam@@ on answered that her direc@@ ts &quot; could give us something that we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion has been broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter to Mr Po@@ ony squee@@ zed his anger through the clip , saying , &quot; Matt Dam@@ on speaks about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - that is SO W@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the prac@@ tor served more than 5,000 res@@ ets and 4,000 liqu@@ eurs since its release .
Dam@@ on comments come to a time , at the exact rac@@ tical representation in the media on the top of social discussion .
after te@@ ens death , Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Movement Black lives Mat@@ ter &apos;s nation@@ ally increased effect and urged the legisl@@ ature and authorities to discrimin@@ atory practices against col@@ lu@@ sion .
in February , singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated records of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums very lucky , &quot; ( albums still have their significance ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their importance .
more recently , leaders of the Movement Black lives Mat@@ ter have published a statement and in response to the question of Fox @-@ news personality Elizabeth H@@ assel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hatred @-@ group .
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le that are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation , or has already taken the Pope , is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; Cro@@ wning first champion
professional sport climbing and operating profit Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who has won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition @-@ show , which has just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to close all levels of his obst@@ acle course .
during the season finale they made two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the finals .
to the last task the climbing of a 75 @-@ foot climbing part was held in 30 seconds .
British finished the task within the time to complete the first ath@@ lete , which ended the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! messages after the hard @-@ won victory , still under shock over the winning of the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned over 10,000 $ or for life , &quot; says Isaac E ! about his he@@ aps money .
as suddenly as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed seated with The Hollywood reporter following the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first did the course at all , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alists , it is the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he got a Gro@@ ll on this .
he is just so happy to have what he has done .
he received awards of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; if I should be struck by someone I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I feel Isaac had felt just the same if they missed the roles .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for a real squ@@ ad@@ ron , the fil@@ ming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aking at Minnesota T@@ wins
mint L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
previously , they were one of the top teams in bas@@ eball . today the Tig@@ ers are at the final place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played their part on Tuesday at the same place against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the T@@ wins missed an opportunity for ascent within a second half of the Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League of Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so hard to summar@@ ize on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit looks three times in the first two routes , then once in the sixth and then once more in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck me for 6 times in the 1 / 3 interior and made three rac@@ ings .
it was only his third successful start in his last 9 games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw at the Bull@@ pen every game , and so I just wants to go in into the game .
the designated tiger H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit @-@ hit from Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits vs Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has shi@@ fted the ch@@ uck@@ le well , &quot; said Aus@@ mus .
he looked good in ( stroke training ) , looked clearly better from the bull@@ do@@ zers , and he brought it right into the game .
at the end of the 7th princes at the end of the 7th Inn , T@@ wins had the best chance to come back into the game again .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy went over to the wall , the only husband , with whom he was confron@@ ted before the re@@ designated Rook@@ ie kn@@ man Miguel S@@ ano , the two @-@ handed two @-@ run Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen .
with a pair of bus@@ hes and the end @-@ run on the second brought Ver@@ h@@ agen the third B@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ w to a Double Play .
it was this in the major league leading 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ w went a double Play .
after Detroit added an Insurance On to the end of the ninth ward , wall mounted a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right @-@ handed use S@@ ano , however , has three pit@@ ches for its fifth gear .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three leaders in the first two inside the case @-@ handed in veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game of injuries in case of a sp@@ inal over a month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I was w@@ ishing for myself , &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; but I felt better when I was rele@@ asing and felt that I would make some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ull issued a single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 winning series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers put in the second , obtained an One @-@ Out Double von Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not hit particularly well , but he caught the right spot .
Hug@@ hes was in the third inning @-@ Count , Hug@@ hes had no points in the third inning , before it was replaced by the A.@@ J.@@ A@@ viewer as a sp@@ ens@@ er .
Hug@@ hes came to meet with four hits for six hits and a walk with four lay@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal Sanchez lost the victory because of a breach of the worm .
it was studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who started the world on the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , on the case of injuries in the middle of August , due to a shoulder type , is supposed to be activated for the start of wed@@ nesday .
with Sanchez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted by the case of injuries in order to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 in four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was bought in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he has bo@@ red since 20 August due to a de@@ err@@ ation in the right thigh .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the chief of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; I think this means &quot; thinking &quot; thinking about military action options may not be held without Germany , &quot; he said .
he introduced the European states &quot; Colle@@ ctive For@@ ward . &quot;
four years ago , we had been glad that the cup of a military involvement has passed in Germany .
now the conflict broke in front of our door@@ step , &quot; said he announced the Deutschl@@ and@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive adv@@ ancement on international assistance for refugees .
Austria control in southern and eastern borders
after Germany again Austria has re@@ inst@@ ated controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister for Internal Affairs , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , retired on Tuesday night in the Austrian TV channel , to Hungary also no one sent back .
also Germany did not send any refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , it has been so agreed &quot; , &quot; she explained .
on the question of an agreement to which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner says , there have already been a bill of talks between the General Director General Security and representatives of Germany .
concrete numbers did not name them and pointed out for talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
last days , tens of thousands of refugees came across the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann in cooperation with several other European heads of state and government met a special summit next week .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states so far not have agreed on a joint action in the crisis .
the EU interior ministers want to meet a new start @-@ up of another 120 000 refugees on the upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) on the upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government plans to support the Länder and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage it together with the Länder , on the late Tuesday evening after nearly four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Ministers of the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery in Berlin .
Merkel stressed , those people who would need to be hum@@ bled this too .
but those who have no lead pro@@ spective , could also remain in Germany .
this opinion was dealt in in a turn .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed , the state as a whole &quot; has now had a &quot; huge power &quot; pit@@ cher .
thousands of du@@ bi@@ ded refugees are now hiding at the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border with Serbia on the night to Tuesday .
for a few hours afterwards the government in Budapest announced the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ g from Romania over Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to , to the planned new border .
the Romanian government condem@@ ning the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
in Turkey because e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands of migrants in the way to the Greek border .

at least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slim figure , is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially its suc@@ rose .
the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them are essential B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. In particular , Mang@@ os contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta car@@ ot@@ ine .
those who eat the fruits , thus supports vision , immune systems and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gan@@ os should not be too soft or to be firm and pleasant smell .
the form@@ work color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green Mang@@ os can taste very tasty .
they should be stored in room temperature and are consumed within less days .
then they naturally taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go is also sav@@ our@@ y dish , a special note .
it mel@@ ts the slightly bitter taste man@@ ders leaf@@ y as Chic@@ ore@@ e and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Mang@@ och@@ ut@@ ney goes well to fish , poultry , lamb and wild .

Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
it is now about 500 years after the Reformation , now there is a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
in the presence of the President Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , a previously unknown square in the park was christ@@ ened at the Opp@@ io Hill on the name of the German re@@ former .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now called the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the heart of Rome , near the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was applied by the Protestant churches of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants could live in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority in what was seen in secret .
in a symbolic way , this is clearly visible in a symbolic way that the Christian faith tradition in Rome should be welcomed .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) visited the early turn of the year 1510 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he emp@@ s the city at that time as a perfect sin@@ e@@ ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions let him be em@@ bol@@ dened by the historian in his later fight against Rome .
with his thes@@ es around the trade trade , Luther continued to run the split of the Western Church .
Hammer Records has invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn is one of the main works painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and read biblical texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible which has now appeared with splendid pictures .
in the beginning the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who was form@@ ulated in 150 moti@@ fs , has form@@ ulated the personal interpretation of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and fan@@ ciful forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adjusted to the particular topics , this can quite be quite dark .
for three years Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he had a sub@@ jective artistic selection from the many them@@ atic areas of the book of all books . &quot;
there are cycles that are subject to themes like crosses , plans , commandments , or father@@ hood .
spont@@ aneously he has fascin@@ ated several partners - this is true of the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its main focus on art@@ works .
and above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who argu@@ ed himself on the basis of painting with the respective Bible verses .
he interpreted the scrip@@ ture by Ot@@ mar Alt , and transl@@ ates into today &apos;s current relations . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
it is nestled between the original Bible @-@ language of Martin Luther and one proposition of the artist who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts for the particular situation .
the ornam@@ ent one has golden letters .
so the 75 year old will allow him to double the deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
that is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions became a major trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , desc@@ ending from a family that belonged to the strict rule of the Order .
&quot; the up@@ bringing happened with the pipe , &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; I tried to work out that , in order to keep me again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot;
his second concern is to say the art in faster time more place : &quot; the perception of picture @-@ worlds today is characterised by an advertisement , and that is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed there .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar : I would like that the viewer can en@@ roll in the pictures , &quot; to inv@@ ade her , discover and discover which power they have : &quot; the picture looks for his oppos@@ ing . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost being on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; was always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art &quot; : &quot; I like what he sees life with his pictures . &quot;
I don &apos;t care about it to completely compreh@@ end the Bible , but chosen for him , most import@@ antly , mysterious topics .
&quot; this was not a collaboration with the eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; may be a p@@ ics of Bible .
for Hans Mö@@ hler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en and find his life . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for fittings in both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as that of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and screen shot - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition presenting the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
start of construction on the BM@@ X track
plans were made , assigned to the company , model@@ ed the course for a circuit : one year later everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track , it was already finished .
fail@@ ures in politics and administration looked for land@@ slide , especially with the residents , who did not toler@@ ate the rail .
thus hill ste@@ ward , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for permission .
the approval could go in October , with Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock during the child and youth committee .
&quot; I hope this year passed even more visible , &quot; she said .
it should be started without &quot; a further memorial &quot; with work on the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees from 2003 to 2019 , when it has a significant sign at the weekend .
football re@@ acts to the apparent location in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy towards helping to control the cont@@ ag@@ erial problems .
&quot; I think it is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in the principle , that &apos;s nothing at all , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must always be interested in getting this subject in the handle , &quot; says DF@@ B boss Wolfgang K@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the German Chanc@@ ell@@ ery and meet the state Minister , Mrs. O@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the theme will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced .
football could and wants to help .
but the decisive points must be put to politics .
because of this , the German So@@ ccer Federation has therefore developed his refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 to a four years &quot; refugee initiative .
&quot; we ensured through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun foundation that this program continues to run until 2019 , &quot; N@@ ren@@ s@@ bach was on the br@@ ink of the UEFA Convention in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .

&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and as they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ boss Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Image &quot; Newspaper ( Tuesday ) and honored the project as &quot; auto @-@ intel@@ li@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on , nobody can take away . &quot;
&quot; we can use anti @-@ federal states , no , we need to use our jet @-@ power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have been so incredibly positive , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent figure of the league . &quot;
for the EM qualifying match against Hungary this Friday , the national team of women held 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
ren@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a big collabor@@ ator of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license agreements have started in their own projects would be great .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is living in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the German Association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the German government , represents a total of 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already called for 2015 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach .
report : SAP Chairman lost an eye in an accident
the board of head of Europe &apos;s biggest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reportedly lost the left eye through a fall at the beginning of July .
after the accident at his brother &apos;s house in the US , he retired after midnight on a water @-@ glass which he carried away in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost ble@@ eds , being power@@ fully excited about being to@@ wed to the streets - that he tells us so rel@@ ates last week , &quot; says the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go after his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet in front of the supervisory board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is attending the meeting and &quot; fully jo@@ bless . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday of Thursday ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company .
&quot; I am full of SAP , &quot; full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was standing regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the United States , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to say to the public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; each can happen to something . &quot;
&quot; it is important to get up again , if you &apos;ve fallen . &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us vs. Kras@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes on a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group of the Europa League have definitely sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also miss the race leader of the football Bundesliga as well as in the fight with the F@@ k Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.00 PM / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we can &apos;t take care of him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether Re@@ us will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach asked : &quot; we expect a return from him on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ or location on the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change to the ke@@ epers position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking the place for a dedicated b@@ art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the soccer player praised the world champion .
if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in the future in all Europe @-@ League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left however open .
with a high probability , the second game is also presented .
the for@@ ay statement by fellow player Re@@ us that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League must be the target , &quot; Julian W@@ eig@@ l &quot; is now mis@@ leading with &quot; that Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we got a good chance to retri@@ eve the title . &quot;
robots cars : government wants leadership on leadership for Germany
according to the will of the German government , Germany should be the change of the technological approach to this development .
on Wednesday the Federal Cab@@ inet approved a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fore@@ sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
on Wednesday , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke to the edge of the International Motor Show in Frankfurt on Wednesday .
the automated , net@@ worked take will increase the road safety and take care of less st@@ ems , said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ parts from the G7 countries who joined the IAA with representatives of industry .
the strategic paper of the Ministry of Communications emphas@@ izes the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a regular tran@@ r@@ arity on digital radio teleph@@ ony .
a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed for testing new technology .
thus , for the driver , &quot; no additional liability risks become br@@ ushed , &quot; the federal government wants to verify the legal framework conditions , &quot; where necessary , to custom@@ ize the new developments . &quot;
in this way , Germany is interested in making sure that the permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees the man as a driver .
when automated driving , the car will take over the car , the driver will more and more to the passenger .
technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that cap@@ tures the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , automated driving will be technically possible to drive on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
even less cars on public roads are expected to be expected shortly after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany will appreciate the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the car can contribute to greater safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said SPD traffic officer S@@ ören bar@@ to@@ l .
the question of liability in case of accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver has to be clearly clari@@ fied .
even the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see sk@@ ep@@ tically - much more than French or Americans .
a survey carried out on the pre @-@ pre @-@ operated survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Test Method DE@@ K@@ RA provides that only eight percent of Germans think that autonomous driving cars will be forced to pass over the next ten years , while 32 percent do not believe it in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed by 2025 , with autonomous driving cars , 33 per cent by 2025 .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave their car completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a collection of the twin @-@ association bit glaucoma , only seven percent would agree to cover control over the entire drive on all roads .
on the highway no less than 15 per cent of all men could imagine at the traffic .
each V@@ essing would leave the car to control under any circumstances .

&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to also win the title without Timo , &quot; said Bundest@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head , during the EM teaching process in Düsseldorf , Germany .

Gaul@@ tier is too old for a en@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of quite large fashion show and a juni@@ per @-@ tale Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which looks terri@@ fying human due to video projections .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , who , among other things , got the stage out@@ fits to the great star of fashion scene , so that he put men in skirts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I was the en@@ f@@ ant of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was easy , and meanwhile it is real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18th at the Kuns@@ thalle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is fortunate that the fashion designer his initially opposed the fashion show in a show over his person .
in fact , he was against the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , one comes in the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
there are tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give a gli@@ mp@@ se of the missing work of man , who has written a fashion story , without having ever completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an excellent as chore@@ ographic works , designed for much effort : to fr@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist was engaged for example .
14 tons of material have spar@@ ked the makers of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October Festival was still a special Sch@@ man@@ oeu@@ v@@ l : a leather tro@@ ug@@ h out@@ fit with Kor@@ s@@ ett .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gaul@@ tier said .
G@@ aul &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is also seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ious modification of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted to his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier .
with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has mild fashion journ@@ als and saw the designs of other designers , as Gaul@@ tier talked in Munich .
but later I bought it , of course .
for his first look , he did not have to pay the models .
they could not get anything , but could keep the clothes .
jewelry held instead of yar@@ dine - Pl@@ ate tip as fashion @-@ nut
previously , it went to the long embro@@ ider@@ ies in and around pl@@ under@@ took to make meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered materials and tips were developed in large amounts for customers , which they worked as blank@@ ets and she@@ er cabins .
this alone , however , does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of Mo@@ vers .
instead , fashion is important .
in the starting times of the pl@@ under point mode has played a greater part , then it pushed back through the home textiles - and it is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls a few examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
the so @-@ called vintage style , which leans on past stal@@ ks , is a increasing order potential .
who is not able to use any niche in the textile branch in Germany isn &apos;t on the market anymore .
with us they already made half of all orders .
Mo@@ hawk slots is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener senior and embro@@ ider@@ y together with nine other companies .
only they must wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been broken .
wholesale outlets and also wholesale are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
the mass production will now be produced far cheaper in Asian region , and is driven almost exclusively through chains .
they are more vulnerable to exported , up to Russia and USA .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association is also attemp@@ ting to score points , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the nitrogen per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been producing a quality seal that shows that we produce ecological and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger branch of the West@@ in Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ y and lace .
to op@@ pose the competition from the Asian region , one must find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
there is a conflict between the brigh@@ test ideas of designers and companies that must be thinking purely economic , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a list of existing design is often only varies , to hold a customer base .
recently some years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter newly developed the historic sp@@ eb@@ ler .
the machine tri@@ butes small kitchen joints in some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ lion in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ e inspired him : &quot; previously , I couldn &apos;t start with a traditional pl@@ ough . &quot;
now it uses the snow @-@ pointed tip for its jewelry .
in a lav@@ ish case , they vig@@ or@@ ously shaped the pattern in silver .
many people in the region identify themselves with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ zer top - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers who have lived their ancestors in the area and the surrounding area .
thus I see my jewellery as modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ger tip .

XI p@@ ushes to open the world &apos;s bro@@ ader for the world
the economy should open to the outside in order to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the reform of the reform .
&quot; China should use to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business @-@ ups , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the central leadership group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform .
promote new start @-@ up and drive reforms in new ways , and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; X@@ i said .
the guide group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list on the arrangement of market access , rest@@ oring the border checks policy , con@@ veying the state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population system .
according to the statement , a negative list will be created , sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is tested and tested by test programs .
the initiative is of importance since it promotes the market a bigger role in allocation of resources , ensuring illegal business environment and re@@ designed the market , said the statement .
the government will also encourage controls over the powers that are transmitted to the corporations and ensure that businesses communicate how they lead their businesses .
the statement also said that Chinese border areas will allow new models of cross @-@ border economic co@@ operations and to explore new mechanisms for promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas will open for private investment .
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitim@@ ate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services to them , &quot; said the statement .
moreover , it is easier for foreigners , to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; permit , optimi@@ zing the requirements , and the application process will be facil@@ itated .
the law of attor@@ neys to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .

EU plans to double mercury @-@ limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory areas
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes , thus providing a significantly higher dose of nerve damage .
the F@@ ood@@ coach consumer organization , who has been proposed by the EU , critic@@ ised the plans seriously : &quot; risks and side effects are lacking for industrial and environment policy with full impact on pregnant and infants , &quot; says Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is to study the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ ks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic @-@ economic reasons &quot; of one on two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are already heavily bur@@ dened as mercury today , based on the still applicable limit values about 50 per cent of the in@@ flows shall not be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the limits would only be reduced by 14.@@ 5 percent .
in exchange for this loos@@ ening , the EU plans to tigh@@ ten the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0,1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ le called this but &quot; trick &quot; because small bur@@ ial fish like some car@@ p usually bur@@ dened as low as some car@@ p , that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
the lowering of the se@@ wage is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des of di@@ stra@@ ction , that helps the economy &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a high @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal , that strongly stim@@ ulated over the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; there are already small amounts of particularly severe damage in the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Environment Committee stated on its homepage clearly stated in terms of the maximum limits , however , that a &quot; health risks of the general population &quot; would not be expected .
mercury runs primarily through the coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written report by the German Federal Ministry of Justice , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ corn re@@ signed more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume issued in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish in the river El@@ be , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanently and surface @-@ covering , &quot; had the &quot; Spiegel &quot; cited in March out of paper .
in the past year , mercury @-@ wide war@@ nings of mercury in fish already submitted to the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
