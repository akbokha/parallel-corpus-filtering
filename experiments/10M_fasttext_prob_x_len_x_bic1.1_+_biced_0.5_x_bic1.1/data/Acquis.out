reag@@ ents , consistent , whether in a soft form or after re@@ funds , must be transparent and are allowed to contain neither se@@ di@@ ments , gels or visible particles .
the scope of the international exchange of the reag@@ ent of the blood @-@ group determination should be colored , at least as long as not until a International Convention is about a uniform system .
reag@@ ents of the blood @-@ group determination are present in such ways and in such amounts that the reag@@ ent tests are not only sufficient to carry tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control bleeding .
the amount of substances in a case must be so large that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy of efficacy in this protocol .
the manufacturer of the manufacturer has over all stages and controls of the reag@@ ent to the blood @-@ group written records .
appropriate samples of all derived reag@@ ents are so long by the laboratory of laboratory which can be accepted by some probability that the batch is no longer used .
the reag@@ ent of the reag@@ ents of the reag@@ ents can include substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary tools to rein@@ forcement the effectiveness and preser@@ vation of the re@@ acts .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are classified into three groups following the origin of their real estate .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents have no substances of human origin .
every single container is black on white printed adhesive in English and French , including the following details : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , in dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the required fluids ,

anti @-@ R@@ h blood @-@ group sera each special specific@@ ity can be one of two types , which differ by the requirements of which a ag@@ glut@@ ination hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells reaches .
with others , which are called &quot; in@@ completely &quot; , a ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved during presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as cattle f@@ alb@@ um@@ in or with the help of other special methods .
several of the &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Sera ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ize on object dreams even hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells that are sw@@ inging in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements aimed at the effectiveness of the R@@ h @-@ Group may change if international standard preparations are available ( i ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood @-@ group serum ( human ) .
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immun@@ ised by the anti@@ gen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain anti@@ gen D , but not with human red blood cells which contain the anti@@ gen D .
&quot; complete &quot; Anti @-@ D Sera must have a tit@@ re of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking sal@@ inity solution .
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel @-@ dissolved in parallel , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ atory of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) serum or a corresponding comparison of comparison to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells , which contain the anti@@ gen D , the serum should react with blood cells , the Do @-@ anti@@ gen .
anti @-@ D Sera which are intended to use object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , after having a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination with a same amount of 40@@ - to 50 percent reduction of C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells which have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immun@@ ised through the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with swelling of human red blood cells which contain the anti@@ gen C , but not with human red blood cells which do not contain the C anti@@ gen .
this Sera is therefore specifically custom for the C anti@@ gen when the tested blood cells were lowered into a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cook@@ ery solution .
the tit@@ re of the anti @-@ C Sera ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ cd@@ de@@ e blood cells .

sera the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood immune persons or can be manufactured using mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies do not need to be effective at the same time .
if a serum is intended for use on object dreams according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ period in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , will not be smaller than with the anti @-@ part antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immune through blood cells or specific substances in the group A immune .
