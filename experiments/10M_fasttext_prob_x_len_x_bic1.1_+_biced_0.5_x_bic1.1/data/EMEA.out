it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tablets ( tablets that dissolve in mouth ) as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injec@@ tion@@ ed solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or sight of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and scales ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental condition which altern@@ ates patients with man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat mild to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
injection solution is used to rapid control of gest@@ ure tur@@ mo@@ il or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral in@@ gest@@ ion of medication is not possible .
for both diseases , the solution can be used to intake or the melting tablets in patients who are preparing the swal@@ lowing of tablets .
in patients who use other medicines at the same time , Abi@@ li@@ fy should be dismant@@ led , and Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adapted .
this imp@@ airs signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works primarily as &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter is to activate the recept@@ ors .
since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus avoiding psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their repet@@ ition will be prevented .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , re@@ appear to prevent symptoms , was investigated in three trials over a year .
the effectiveness of injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases caused by gest@@ ive rest@@ lessness , compared to placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo in another study compared to 160 patients in which the man@@ ian symptoms were stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared to a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which was involved in increased rest@@ lessness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment .
the company also led studies through to investigate how the body pul@@ ls the melting tablets and the solution for inser@@ ting ( up ) .
in the two studies involving an injection solution , Abi@@ li@@ fy was administered in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms as the patients receiving a placebo .
in the use for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy was more effective than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo after re@@ appear man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy @-@ injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased more effective than placebo and similar symptoms were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal disorders ( un@@ controll@@ able ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , nausea , fatigue ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) , in@@ som@@ ing ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , confron@@ ted with the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution for rapid control of gest@@ ion and behavi@@ oral problems in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , when an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Chugai Pharmaceutical Ltd . an auth@@ orization for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who have mostly man@@ ische episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day when a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day is independent of meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not demonstrated although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mono@@ therapies or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been demonstrated .
a lower initial dose should be considered with regard to the larger sensitivity of these patients ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the start or after change of an anti @-@ psychological therapy , even with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased superf@@ ine risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be treated with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions which are used for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which one year or less lasting , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l un@@ faithful dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
if patients , with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ics should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if a patient sign signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or clear high fever without any additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics have to be de@@ posed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with cranes in the history of history , or in conditions that are related with cr@@ amp@@ hor@@ ism in relation to be treated with caution .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l associated with psych@@ ologists who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted de@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ one or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ th@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be observed regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could cause serious complications .
due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system is caution when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in combination with alcohol or other central @-@ effective drug may be taken with over@@ bearing side effects such as seals ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , and therefore , similar dos@@ ing reductions should be made .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) , the common application of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 into higher plasma levels compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should weigh potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease , should have similar effects , and therefore , similar dos@@ ing reductions should be made .
after replacing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age at the beginning of the esc@@ ort therapy .
cap@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are given together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 Metho@@ y@@ morph@@ ine R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patients should be advised to notify their doctor if she is pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
due to the in@@ adequate data situation for the safety of human being and due to the reproduction of the animal resulting concerns , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential health is clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to use until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative impact on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total of smaller incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ is@@ ia , d@@ yst@@ ony and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ies compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ ac ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trials over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients were placebo .
in another controlled trial study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ische episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ ac treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks with a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % treated with placebo .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically were significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameter , there were no medic@@ ally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and also in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has also been reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , her@@ e@@ un@@ wanted frag@@ ile events and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since market launch , un@@ intenti@@ onal or un@@ cl@@ utter@@ ed super@@ do@@ si@@ ations were observed with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg .
although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis treatment in the treatment of an overdose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has high plasma data .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is suspected in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro there was a high aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and to hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks in healthy volunteers , the Pos@@ it@@ ry emissions tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ ing of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dal and at the coup .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statistically significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a single Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol controlled trial , 52 % of the number of patients who contributed to study medication should be similar to study medications in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study games , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Depression @-@ scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % among the placebo .
in a Ol@@ da@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia of 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study &apos; weight gain &apos; occurred below Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( N = 18 or 13 % of the most valuable patients ) compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible dos@@ ing of over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l demonstrated efficacy comparable to placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ arding and active @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ists for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ische or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a compar@@ ative efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect which was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in the week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a compar@@ ative share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania on how lithium and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ ac .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ische or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psychological characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks did not affect Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy in comparison to the reduction of therapeutic symptoms in comparison to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ tic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , predominantly with the prevention of a feedback in the mania .
based on in vitro @-@ studies the enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ y of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the medium @-@ center elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in an extensive met@@ abolic rate via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and about 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not have regard to clin@@ ically significant differences concerning ethnic origin or the effect of smoke to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and D@@ eh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and D@@ eh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not enough to pull the shots on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety pro@@ ofing , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , reprodu@@ ci@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for can@@ o@@ ing potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data showed no particular dangers for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ological effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of human beings , so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects surrounding the dose of dos@@ ing tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 @-@ 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to ten times the medium @-@ ady Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum daily dose of humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was a result of the precipitation of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l found in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral care of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended daily dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ ple of the recommended maximum dose of man based on mg / m2 ) .
however , during the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate concentration of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , there were no more than 6 % concentration in the study , which were found in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
these effects were observed for doses of dos@@ ages , which resulted in ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ times of the medium @-@ ady Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C on the recommended clinical route .

for prevention of recur@@ r@@ ence Man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the therapy should be continued with the same dose .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l associated dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ one or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .

it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is suspected in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in a Ol@@ da@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia of 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study &apos; weight gain &apos; occurred below Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( N = 18 or 13 % of the most valuable patients ) compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy comparable to placebo .
in a relative bio availability study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics was compared to 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form at healthy volunteers , the proportion was between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Extra@@ ction was found a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis as a result of the decline of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral care of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended daily dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ ple of the recommended maximum dose of man based on mg / m2 ) .
these effects were observed for doses of dos@@ ages , which resulted in ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ times of the medium @-@ ady Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C on the recommended clinical route .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injec@@ ting solution is used to rapid control of ag@@ itation and behavi@@ ors in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
to minim@@ ize the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep is recommended in the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle underneath a walk from adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account of the stored or ac@@ utely therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medication related to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution .
there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral disorders caused by sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with gasoline injection systems in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution is considered necessary , the patients should be observed in terms of extreme inser@@ tion or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
tests on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ar@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical pois@@ oning ( through prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be treated with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions which are used for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l associated dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ th@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be observed regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could cause serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the sole offering of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dosage ) was used as a disposable in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular image and who received dose of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .
105 the H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in comparison of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) , the common application of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 into higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , must have similar effects , and therefore , similar dos@@ ing reductions should be made .
after replacing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age at the beginning of the esc@@ ort therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received , was the intensity of se@@ d@@ ation t@@ aller compared to the sole offering of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were considered possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects in clinical trials ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients were placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks with a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % were treated with placebo .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically were significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameter , there were no medic@@ ally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and also in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has also been reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , her@@ e@@ un@@ wanted frag@@ ile events and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ oral problems was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statistically significant greater improvements of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ ings compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral problems , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the average improvement from the output value on the P@@ AN@@ SS ( Compon@@ ent score ) with the primary 2 hour end@@ point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar effectiveness in relation to the total population was observed , but a statistical significance was observed because of a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statistically significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a single Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ ac controlled trial , 52 % of the number of patients who contributed to study medication would be similar to the study medication , both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study games , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than on Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( oral ) a significantly higher reduction of recovery rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % among placebo .
in a Ol@@ da@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia of 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients with oral Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( N = 18 or 13 % of the analysis of patients ) in significantly fewer patients , an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ische or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psychological characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks did not apply to Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy in comparison to the reduction of therapeutic symptoms in comparison to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study with man@@ ian patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly with the prevention of a feedback in the mania .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of 90 % bigger the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies involving healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma time is 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and apes and resulted in any direct tox@@ icity of a target group after repeated treatment with systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .
in studies for the reproduction of the reproductive medicine after i@@ v application , there was no safety relevant concerns based on maternal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rabbits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) to safety sp@@ uri@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , reprodu@@ ci@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for can@@ o@@ ing potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data provided no particular dangers for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ological effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of human beings , so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effects of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing medication ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing medicines .
if only the people who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in relation to the efficacy indicators , such as time , deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
however , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing medicines .
in addition , it may not be used in patients who have low neutr@@ als in the blood before the start of the treatment .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was containing drug @-@ containing drug in patients whose first treatment was not more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs , unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs must not be given to other drugs to decrease effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted Abra@@ acy Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited a approval for the distribution of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and not shown for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( Neut@@ ral count &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ athy grade 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved at degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dos@@ ing adjustments in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with adverse kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dos@@ ing adjustments in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to in@@ sufficient data to in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ arti@@ fic@@ ated by pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have considerably lower pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and has a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ phi@@ lic number has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mb@@ cy@@ te number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while clearly demonstrated with Abra@@ x@@ ane in relation to these car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents in the inde@@ xed patient collection are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rhoea , these patients can be treated with common anti@@ em@@ eti@@ ka and con@@ sti@@ p@@ izing resources .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant or pregnant women at child@@ bearing age , which are not an effective contra@@ c@@ eption practic@@ ing , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women in the nursing age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable prevention method .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is enriched , while and up to six months after the treatment , no child bear witness .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment over a sperm contra@@ ctions , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequently ) and dizziness ( common ) that can affect the transport of transport and ability to serve machines .
listed below are the most common and most important events of adverse events that were treated in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer that were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III clinical trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most consp@@ ic@@ uous hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( in 79 % of patients ) and was fast reversible and dos@@ cop@@ ia ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and were severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , the side effects are listed , which appear in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased cre@@ atine hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in the blood , reduced potassium in blood , reduced potassium in blood heart disease :

as@@ hel@@ pl@@ essness 1 The prevalence of hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity reaction will be calculated based on a defin@@ able case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no problem with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ cr@@ ot@@ ub@@ uli active ingredient , which promotes the co@@ sting of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ ul@@ cers and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by in@@ hibition of their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of normal dynamic re@@ organisation of micro@@ cr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network that is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and has been demonstrated in the context of in @-@ vitro studies that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ or@@ ally transport by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ re@@ receptor is communic@@ ated and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( flo@@ ated protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of tum@@ ors appearance .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two in@@ ar@@ dy @-@ blind studies and of 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in form an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were performed in form of sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 , either in the form of sol@@ vent containing allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without medication ( N = 229 ) .
when recording into the study , 64 % of the patients had an adverse state of condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % for metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity against pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree of patients who lived at a time during therapy a peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 .
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy for sound on Bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the drug ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane on patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration in multi@@ phase mode took off .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ um distribution and / or pasture connection of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ min in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane compared to a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of soluble pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro @-@ studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily covered with 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabolism ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after an 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative figure 4 % of the total total dose is less than 1 % of the metabolism 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which points to a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ ance .
however , more than patients at the age of 75 are only a few data available since only 3 patients participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability has been detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light @-@ protected lighting above 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogenic medicine and , as well as other potential @-@ toxic substances , should be avoided with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ring@@ es , a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chloride @-@ in@@ fusion solution is in@@ jected trans@@ forming into a Abra@@ x@@ ane di@@ pping bottle for a period of at least 1 minute .
after adding the solution , the drinking bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good release of the soli@@ ds .
then the drinking bottle for at least 2 minutes should slowly be slowly and / or inver@@ ted , until a complete reset pension of the powder is done .
if fail@@ ures or in@@ tox@@ ins are visible , the drinking bottle must be gently inver@@ ted to achieve a complete reset pension .
the exact overall dos@@ ing volume of the 5 @-@ mg / ml Sus@@ pension will be calculated and the corresponding amount of Abra@@ x@@ ane is in@@ jected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion .

this means that ab@@ ov@@ amed is similar to a biological medicinal product that is approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same ingredient ( also called &quot; reference ti@@ cian &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood flow values , in which a blood trans@@ fusion may occur in relation to a blood trans@@ fusion , and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ wage has to be conducted under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases which is indicated for the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to have a pec@@ uli@@ ar @-@ bleeding , ab@@ b@@ stre@@ amed is in@@ ject to in@@ ject .
injection can also be done by the patient or his main@@ tain@@ er , as long as they have appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients who received chemotherapy should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter at adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl for children ) .
the iron values of all patients are prescribed prior to treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and ice @-@ energy supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thereby that the body does not adequ@@ ately addressed to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etin .
Ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells , thereby reducing blood loss .

Ab@@ se@@ ap@@ sed was compared to administration in a v@@ ein in a v@@ ein as part of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients that had caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all participating patients on this study was in@@ jected at least eight weeks . E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been in@@ jected into a V@@ ene before they were either en@@ acted or still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in weeks 25 @-@ 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ds were given in the same degree as in those who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in contrast , patients who continue to have received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0,0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ L .
the most common adverse effect of ab@@ se@@ be@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure which can occasionally lead to symptoms of cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , loose mig@@ raine heada@@ ches and confusion .

for reducing foreign blood , se@@ wage could be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ e@@ dic procedure in adults without iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications may be expected .
( HB 10 @-@ 13 g / d@@ L ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be used not to participate in a aut@@ olog@@ ous blood @-@ loss program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration ranges between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for the at@@ ric patients who should lie hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
instructions and symptoms can be different depending on age , gender and disease range ; hence , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease by the physician may be required .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins by more than 2 g / d@@ dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , may occasionally be observed in a patient individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ds over or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
given that hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / d@@ L ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / d@@ L ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster growth exceeds 12 g / d@@ L ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa dose is 25 % .
patients should be supervised to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of an@@ emia and an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low heat value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher vibration doses than patients in which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low heat value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher vibration doses than patients in which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .

instructions and subsequent studies can be different depending on age , gender and disease range ; hence , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease by the physician may be required .
given that hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / d@@ L ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be supervised to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is needed for control of an@@ es@@ yl symptoms .
if after 4 treatment @-@ weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of at least 1 g / L ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the re@@ ti@@ dal value increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output value , the dose of 150 kg / kg should be retained three times a week or 450 kg / kg per week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / L ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the re@@ ti@@ dal cy@@ te number has risen to &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose should be increased to 300 kg / kg three times a week .

patients with slight an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , which is necessary to obtain the careful injection of ≥ 4 blood con@@ serv@@ ings , should be obtained sec@@ at in a dose of 600 kg / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood@@ less program started , so that before the start of se@@ ab@@ ated therapy , large iron reserves are available .
6 . the recommended dosage is 600 mg / kg of ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa , which should be given once a weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of the intervention ( Day 0 ) .

Ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sti@@ p@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported on the occurr@@ ence of an anti @-@ physical immun@@ ologist PR@@ CA after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin .
in patients with sudden active effect , as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / month ) , the re@@ ti@@ dal value should be determined and the usual causes for failure to speak ( iron , folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium @-@ toxic , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are determined .
if the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ te is worth , taking into account the an@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ ti@@ c@@ cy@@ te &quot; index &quot; ) , the thro@@ cy@@ tic and leu@@ co@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason is to be found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin antibody should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row to diag@@ nose a PR@@ CA .

8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not exceed the lower limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration below Section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , an increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ous events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis stimul@@ ating active ingredients ( ESA ) were given by a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is attributable to the control of an@@ es@@ yl symptoms and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ body rise should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clinical evidence of cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or in@@ suffici@@ ency therapy should not exceed the lower limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations below section 4.2 .
according to the usage of these findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not di@@ aly@@ ed , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated .
patients with tumour patients should be considered to ass@@ essing the therapy efficiency of ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin response ( patients who may have to be trans@@ founded ) .
if the H@@ b rise is larger than 2 g / l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / d@@ L ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize the risk for possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemical therapist an@@ emia - Dos@@ is@@ adjustment with the aim to keep the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / d@@ L ) .
the decision for use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit of risk reduction under the patient &apos;s participation , which should also take into consideration the specific clinical context .
in patients who are planned for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic operation , if possible , before the beginning of the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia were examined and accordingly treated .
patients who submit to a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic surgery should have an adequate risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
furthermore , it can not be excluded , that in the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa for patients with a starting signal value of &gt; 13 g / d@@ L , an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events can stand .
in several controlled studies , ep@@ ox@@ ins have not been demonstrated to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia or reducing the risk of tumor cells .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mol / l ) was stri@@ ked .
when ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa is used together with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be adapted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro @-@ vitro investigations , there are no evidence of an interaction between ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F related to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .

the most common side effect in the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa is a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent increase of blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ ature events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ inen .

survival and tumor cells were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were randomised , placebo @-@ controlled trials , and
in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin patients and the patient &apos;s patients .
in these studies the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to different common mal@@ ign@@ an@@ cies , statistically significantly higher mortality rate than in controls .
overall survival in studies could not be expressed by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treated patients and inspec@@ tions .
there is an elevated risk for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events with tumour patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clari@@ fied how far these results are treated with the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine in tumour patient treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in under 13 g / d@@ L , as few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life time of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that can be reached after i@@ v injection .
there are no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain equal , regardless of whether they will be determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift .

therefore , ab@@ rupt@@ ly has to be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in the case of elevated or rising potassium , your doctor may consider any inter@@ ruption of treatment with ab@@ ys@@ ses until the potassium levels lie back in the standard range .
if you do not suffer chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster level does not exceed a given value .
according to the time of this detection is caused by the treatment of blood @-@ blood with ab@@ ys@@ ses in adults with chronic kidney problems ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) that are not di@@ aly@@ ed , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both at women after men@@ opause and men .
it is applied in patients with a high fre@@ igh@@ ting risk ( bone qu@@ arri@@ es ) , including patients who had suffered a so@@ trau@@ matic envelope such as falling down ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changed the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hat@@ s should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) , or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) is in the three days after the in@@ fusion of symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
Ac@@ cept@@ sta &apos;s treatment may only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in treating this disease .
because the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta same is as in zom@@ eta , was a part of the data material used for zom@@ eta to ass@@ essing the Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s rating .
in the first study , almost 8 000 older women were involved with o@@ steopor@@ osis and it was investigated the number of verteb@@ rates and hat@@ s over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis more than 50 years , who had suffered a sil@@ t fra@@ cture ; the number of frac@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was compared to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in blood again decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under Ac@@ cept@@ sta ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % in comparison to the patients under placebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ cept@@ sta ( with or without any other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) , the risk of frac@@ tures were reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving males and women with hat@@ s , 9 % of the patients under Ac@@ cept@@ sta had a questionnaire ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ cept@@ sta compete in the first three days after in@@ fusion , and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ cept@@ sta must not be applied to patients who may be ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against z@@ ole@@ dr@@ y@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ amide or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion unit and o@@ ste@@ on@@ dro@@ sis ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in the pine .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance materials for physicians to prescri@@ be the Ac@@ cum@@ ulation treatment for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis as well as similar material for patients who are explained to the medicine &apos;s side effects and should be pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted an auth@@ orization to the company Nov@@ art@@ is Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited , approval for the distribution of Ac@@ p@@ sta in the entire European Union .

treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope .
for treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion is recommended by 5 mg of Ac@@ la@@ sta once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope , the administration of Ac@@ cept@@ sta &apos;s in@@ fusion is recommended to two or more weeks after surgery ( see Section 5.1 ) .
Ac@@ cept@@ sta &apos;s treatment should only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ cept@@ sta , a long pro@@ longed period of treatment was observed in patients who had addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ cept@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope , the initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. imm@@ oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ cept@@ sta , can be reduced to Ac@@ cept@@ sta by the gift of acet@@ am@@ ol or is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
patients with kidney problems ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ cept@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences in these patient groups .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose of dos@@ ing is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years since data are missing for in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and efficacy .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as limited clinical experiences in this patient population .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ ine is to treat sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D before the start of therapy ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid sett@@ ling of the effect of c@@ ole@@ dr@@ y@@ lic acid on bone structure , a temporary , consistent hypo@@ kal@@ ine is able to develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ cept@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) .
additionally , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patient with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ cept@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
canc@@ ers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be observed before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ onate to a dental examination with reasonable preventive denti@@ sts .
for patients who require dental surg@@ eries , no data are available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ onate reduces the risk for o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ ses in the pine region .
the clinical assessment of the treated physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ cept@@ sta , can be reduced to the application of Ac@@ cept@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of severe adverse events reported cases of pre @-@ hoped was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 out of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , total incidence of anticip@@ ation was comparable between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , un@@ wanted regulatory effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ y@@ lic acid was associated with kidney function , which is expressed as a decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum @-@ cancer ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured in front of the administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a partial kidney function were comparable to o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was 1.8 % of patients treated with acet@@ ate treated with 0,8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings the temporary as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium @-@ values occurred below 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ cum@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ p@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients compl@@ ementary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical fra@@ ctions following a fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical fra@@ ctions after a recent body @-@ question@@ ing the vitamin D mirrors have not been rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of z@@ ole@@ dr@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion station , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the pine@@ wood area has been noted above all in cancer patients , over o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( pri@@ mo@@ v in the pine@@ apple ) , including c@@ ole@@ dr@@ y@@ lic acid , were treated .
many of these patients had signs for local infections including o@@ ste@@ ar@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients following c@@ ah@@ nex@@ p@@ ments or other dental crowns .
7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients underwent o@@ ste@@ on@@ tro@@ se in a pine zone near Ac@@ la@@ sta and in one with placebo treated patients .
in case of overdose , leading to a clinical @-@ relevant hypo@@ kal@@ ine , the amount of calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion can be achieved by calcium @-@ glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density filter or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the donation than ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without the indication of an existing cycl@@ ist fra@@ cture .
effects on morph@@ omet@@ rical frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ rates ( see Table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk for verteb@@ rates compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta pointed a permanent effect over three years that resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density at lum@@ bar spine , hips , and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly to all points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.7 % , all the hips around 6.0 % , the percentage point of 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ cept@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone op@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vic line .
a micro@@ computer @-@ tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients compared to placebo an increase of the supporting bone volume and preser@@ vation of supporting bone architecture .
bone sales markings The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were determined in periods of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in perio@@ dic intervals during study duration .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP to 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value until 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was reduced by 61 % below the initial growth after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value until 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value of 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value until 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 , i.e. , oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ gage result was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
impact on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D as compared to placebo treatment and donation than all points of time .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treatment led over 24 months compared to placebo treatment for an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total production and 4.3 % at the donation tree .
clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized 508 males and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated according to 24 months .
the study was not designed to demonstrate a reduction in clinical fra@@ ctions in men ; the frequency of clinical fra@@ ctions was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in comparison to placebo .
in another study of men ( the CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the once annual administration of Ac@@ cum@@ sta in compare to the percentage change from Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at relative to the percentage change in Len@@ den@@ dr@@ s @-@ BM@@ D was not inferior to the initial value of 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone of Ac@@ cept@@ sta was examined in patients and patients at the age of 30 with a radi@@ ologically advanced Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ fold of age @-@ specific normal @-@ value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 . the efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of d@@ ole@@ dr@@ y@@ lic acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg Ris@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once daily during 2 months was proved in two six @-@ month compar@@ ative studies .
after 6 months , a similar decrease of pain strength and pain reduction was observed in comparison to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ at compared to 6 months .
patients who were recorded in the end of the six month main study as Respon@@ sibility ( had been addressed to the therapy ) , could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 patients treated with the risk study , the therapeutic response could be observed in 141 of the patients suffering from Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 71 of those treated with ris@@ on@@ dr@@ ate treated patients with a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period from 18 months after the use .
one unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of d@@ ole@@ dr@@ y@@ lic acid at 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data that has been assessed as dos@@ is@@ independent .
after that , the plasma levels quickly increased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long run phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
fast @-@ phase disappearance from the large cycle with semi @-@ value times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ mination phase with a terminal Eli@@ mination time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16 % of the recommended dose in urine , while the rest is bound mainly in bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in decrease of the Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ acid concentration of 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ instream against time ) .
a decreased Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme systems met@@ abolic substances is unlikely to met@@ abolic because Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ y@@ lic acid is not met@@ abolic with people , and because they are a weak or not a direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ y@@ lic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 evaluated patients were 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function up down to a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dose adap@@ tion of the z@@ ole@@ dr@@ y@@ lic acid .
because of severe kidney problems ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- cle@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restri@@ cts data to this population are not possible for these population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ effective intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg of body weight .
in studies on dogs single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended physical therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
Sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ole@@ dr@@ y@@ lic acid were administered in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose which was administered in intervals of 2 - 3 weeks , administered in intervals of 2 - 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which is equivalent to the 7@@ x of the Human Therap@@ y exposure , referred to the AU@@ C , equivalent to the AU@@ C , equivalent ) .

the most common findings in studies with repeated application was a prolifer@@ ation of primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ si@@ sis of long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all dos@@ ages , a beam that reflects pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats it observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity of dos@@ ages ranging from 0.2 mg / kg as an outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such a skel@@ eton .

the following table ( table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of un@@ wanted effects in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients who have been treated for weight reduction and related met@@ abolic diseases .
if the incidence was statistically significantly higher than the corresponding placebo rate ( for un@@ wanted effects ≥ 1 % ) or when they were clin@@ ically meaningful ( for un@@ wanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . ng At the assessment of side effects , the following number of adverse events are found :
very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; common ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ;
in a clinical study , in which a limited number of persons ( up to 300 mg ) were given , only slight symptoms have been observed .
the patients had a BMI of 30 kg / m ² or BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ic and / or Dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ an@@ emia .
n weight reduction after one year was 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the output value , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.9 kg of C@@ I@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public . this document is a summary of the European Public Party report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) which is explained in the studies as the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to proceed to recommendations on the application of the medication .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can &apos;t be used in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) can be used together with another diabetes medicine ( dual therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) it can not be used with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or insulin , the existing dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ical or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be enhanced and the blood sugar level is reduced , so that type 2 diabetes improves better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ one in tri@@ ple@@ y was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ stoff , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo until 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cer@@ y@@ lic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood glucose levels in use of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were reduced .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos revealed to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ um in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to placebo in addition to placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision , infections of the upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be applied in patients who may not react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or di@@ abolic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ( high ket@@ ones - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos was used as part of a mono@@ therapies ( in the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a approval for the market launch of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin delivery in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ appropriate for contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years no data are available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who threatened to develop at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attacks or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the physician should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dosage .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or oil , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ de@@ me when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced macro@@ vas@@ cul@@ ine disease was performed .
in this study there was an increase in reports about heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased initial liver factors ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors can be increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard , the liver values are as soon as possible to control .
if a patient had symptoms to point to a he@@ pati@@ c dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved nausea , vomiting , th@@ igh@@ ting stress , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite , and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are to check the liver count values .
the decision , whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on continued , should be led by the lab parameters of the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can stem from fat storage and is connected with fluid re@@ tention in some cases .
as a result of a hem@@ at@@ y le@@ verage occurred in the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a slight reduction in the middle of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of the increased insulin sensitivity of patients , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is an oral and triple combination therapy with a sulph@@ ite @-@ har@@ n@@ ant or double @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ ing @-@ dependent hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
after the market launch , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ din@@ di@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , is reported on an occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular de@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct link between the taking of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms to be aware of when patients report about distur@@ ban@@ ces of vision ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological issues should be considered .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages un@@ wanted events concerning bone breasts of randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on
the effec@@ tual incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ TI@@ VE study , a study over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures near 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with compar@@ ative medication .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient needs a pregnancy or occurs , the treatment is decreasing ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies in the investigation of the inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on have no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ euticals in dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ er@@ ised by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tive , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with fibro@@ bla@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on for 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a lowering of AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the pregnancy is reduced by hypertension and increased insulin resistance of the breast milk , thereby reducing the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fat growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated in this data ) .
these lead to a trans@@ itory change of the counter and the index of lenti@@ l , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ic drugs .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ ge compet@@ ed over the thre@@ e@@ fold of the upper limit of the standard lower than placebo , but more rarely than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in an out@@ come study of patients with pre @-@ existing macro@@ vas@@ cul@@ itis was the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency while Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch has been reported rarely beyond heart failure using Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ nese .
it was a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted inci@@ dents concerning bone breasts of randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medication .
in the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing PRO@@ AC@@ TI@@ VE study , frac@@ tures found in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) associated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with compar@@ ative medication .
in taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to act on activation of specific kernel recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) , which leads to an elevated insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscles .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripher@@ al glucose in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ d versus Mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the therapeutic efficacy ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time of two years after the start of therapy a blood glucose monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was observed by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate despite an in@@ adequate optim@@ isation phase , random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continued to provide insulin ; reducing insulin injec@@ tions in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
in clinical trials over one year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ quota compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mono@@ therap@@ ists with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week evaluation of type 2 diabe@@ tic .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma tri@@ glyceri@@ des and the free fatty acids and a rise in the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyceri@@ de compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo , Met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ d , the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel .
compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo , a statistically significant increase in L@@ DL Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel was observed while under met@@ form@@ in and li@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ d were observed .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the sober @-@ tri@@ glyceri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ den@@ sely increased tri@@ glyceri@@ de level , both over a effect on the tri@@ glyceri@@ de absorption , as well as on the om@@ ic tri@@ glyceri@@ de synthesis .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ TI@@ VE study , a cardiovascular risk study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing macro@@ vas@@ cul@@ itis in groups were randomised , which received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is res@@ or@@ ated quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ changing Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one generally can be reached within 2 hours after application .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was performed in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as does not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is not able to use insulin effectively .
the study was measured after 12 weeks of concentration of a substance ( gly@@ col@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which pointed out on it that blood sugar levels were lowered considerably , as with a other human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who are likely to react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the acet@@ ph@@ ane doses have to be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may effect on blood sugar ( the complete list is the packing age ) .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was transferred to the risk of diabetes over the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted an auth@@ orization to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transfer of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane across the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily , if a rapid initi@@ als effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
injection no@@ bility must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the overall dose was in@@ jected .
patients whose blood sugar results are clearly improved by an intensive insulin therapy , hypo@@ glyc@@ emia warning signs can be changed and should be cons@@ ul@@ ted accordingly .
any change in terms of starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human@@ oid or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin origin ) can result in that a change of dosage is required .
if moving to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients a dose of dos@@ ing is required , this may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
some patients whose hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ic reactions emerged after a shift from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or differently than in their previous insulin .
prior to travelling , which should go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead , such as insulin and meals must be applied to other times .
the physician must therefore consider possible inter@@ actions at the therapy , and his patients always question@@ ing these drugs .

however , hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can be progres@@ sively developing : • Easy hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can be treated by the or@@ atory intake of glucose and sugar derivatives .
diabe@@ tics are therefore always treated with glucose syrup , cand@@ y , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose that is given intraven@@ ously through the physician .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours .
Res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ p@@ tion@@ ed profile is due to it that it is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed re@@ or@@ ption .
a number of split @-@ se@@ di@@ ments ( hydro@@ ly@@ se@@ - ) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the previously formed metabol@@ ites is active .

this document is a summary of the European Public Employment Center ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which explains how the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) is assessed in order to proceed to recommendations on the application of the medication .
the phar@@ ma is an effective integral part in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin ( r@@ DNA ) and is manufactured using the process of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology :
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europe@@ an © EMEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document @-@ only by the EMEA is . how was Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id studied ?
Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be used in patients who are possibly sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the acet@@ yl@@ p@@ id doses have to be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted an auth@@ orization to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S auth@@ orization for the transfer of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id to the whole of the European Union .
when two kinds of insulin are mixed , first the amount of insulin delivery needs to be re@@ produced , then the amount of insulin delivery .
3 If the switch to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id is needed in patients with a dose of dos@@ ing , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
prior to travelling , which should go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead , such as insulin and meals must be applied to other times .
5 general diseases and complaints in the administration of validity - Local trans@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity reaction at the injection site while insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity reaction ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) .
diabe@@ tics are therefore always treated with glucose syrup , cand@@ y , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose that is given intraven@@ ously through the physician .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mol / l ) with 204 di@@ ab@@ thetic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mol / l ) decreased the mortality rate by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 1.5 @-@ 3.5 hours and the total active duration is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and teenage children ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited , however , the assumption that the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile in children and adolescents according to adults is similar .
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations of 0.05 % sodium chloride , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % protein glucose with 40 m@@ mol / l potassium chloride are stable at room temperature for 24 hours at room temperature .
11 If the switch to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id is needed in patients with a dose of dos@@ ing , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
prior to travelling , which should go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead , such as insulin and meals must be applied to other times .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already used signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out notes ( &quot; stones &quot; ; i.e. larger urine cryst@@ alline deposits , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ure@@ ter levels are still dil@@ uted after two to four weeks , more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose may be increased to 120 mg daily .
during the first treatment months , still Gi@@ cht@@ an@@ cies may still occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients are taking care for at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic further medicines for prevention of pois@@ ons .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had transpl@@ antation , as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study involved in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily , 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to placebo ( pseu@@ dost@@ em ) and compared to Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different drug for treating hypertension ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily , 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg per day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose urine intake levels in the blood was below 6 mg / d@@ L in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who received Aden@@ ur@@ ic at a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who received 120 m@@ g. a day during the last three measurements , in the blood of below 6 mg / d@@ L .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients in the case of placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , skin rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , patients with heart failure may involve an increased risk of certain side effects , affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic in the blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , however , was also an higher risk of adverse events related to heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia in diseases which have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the nur@@ ses known or present of the tox@@ icity and / or of arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ en@@ har@@ mac@@ eration level is still more &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ mol / l ) , a dos@@ ing increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC can be considered 120 m@@ g. a day .
in patients with severe kidney function , the effectiveness and safety were not completely examined until now ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
for children and young people there are no experiences with children and young people , the application of Feb@@ . ux@@ e@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of the Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ sp@@ ik@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study of the proportion of patients in which the last three month had a certain serum levels &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) .

the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority upon the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) , compared to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day compared to the treatment with conventional used cans Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority upon the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ l ) and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily , compared to the treatment with conventional used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction in the serum levels of &lt; 6.0 mg / L ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ mol / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and kept permanently about the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x a day ; 10 patients with serum samples &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg of 1 x a day .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function Limit The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 m@@ g. 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x day ) of patients were achieved .
there were no clinical significant differences regarding the percentage of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration were ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had an serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L .
the data collected in the past two years showed that the lasting reduction in the incidence of serum levels showed a decrease in the incidence of arthritis ( &lt; 6 mg / l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients were needed in the months 16 to 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the sight of the g@@ no@@ des , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete van@@ ishing of sight notes until month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ . ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the plasma concentration period ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ . ost@@ at after administration is easier and multi@@ pler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for instance , doses between 120 mg and 300 mg will be observed for Feb@@ . ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C , which is larger than the dos@@ ing proportional increase .
after taking a simple or multi@@ pler of 80 and 120 m@@ g. a day the C@@ max amounts to 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clinical significant change in the percentage decrease in the serum concentration was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ . ost@@ at is located in the range of 29 to 75 l ( doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg ) .
the pl@@ ot@@ oxin injection of Feb@@ . ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary li@@ aison an alb@@ um@@ in ) and is over the concentration width which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg , constant .
in vitro @-@ studies in vitro @-@ micro@@ som@@ ites showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that they origin@@ ate from the U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ edly Feb@@ . ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose found in urine as un@@ changeable f@@ us@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) , whose well known oxid@@ ative metabolism ( 13 % ) and its con@@ jug@@ ate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabolism ( 3 % ) were returned .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the Ur@@ in , approximately 45 % of the dose found in the chair as un@@ changing mattress ( 1 % ) , its well known oxid@@ ative metabolism ( 25 % ) and its con@@ jug@@ ate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabolism ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of Feb@@ . ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function .
average total @-@ time AU@@ C from Feb@@ . ost@@ at decreased by approximately 1.8 times of 7.5 m / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 m g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function Limit After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ ean P@@ ug@@ h @-@ classification A ) or medium @-@ heavier ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h classification B ) or moderate ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h classification ) ) the C@@ max and AU@@ C of Feb@@ . ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites were not significantly reduced compared to subjects with normal liver function .

carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertili@@ zation in male rats introduced a statistically significant increase of urine tum@@ ors ( trans@@ itional cell pap@@ ill@@ oms and carcin@@ omas ) in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ dosed group , found about 11 times of exposure during humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ suit met@@ abolic and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that f@@ ux@@ e@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertili@@ zation and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are bro@@ wned ) in women after men@@ opause , where a risk of low vitamin D levels exists .
the patient needs to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other drugs ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) .
to avoid the irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not take up until after the first food intake of the day , taking place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 is already being used separately in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company presented data before , which come from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase of vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than in those who had only premium income ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data , indicating that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is precisely the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are heada@@ ches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ um ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive organs such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , so@@ iling ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( swal@@ lowing ) , beaten abdom@@ en ( blin@@ king belly ) as well as aci@@ dic t@@ ins .
in patients with similar hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against al@@ dr@@ y@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or one of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE cannot be applied .
it must not be applied in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who do not stand or sit in at least 30 minutes .
Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Jack@@ me Ltd . a approval for placing AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union .
cap@@ ric@@ ular , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vit@@ amine aux@@ iliary agents ) for the day .
the following indications are accurate to decrease the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swallowed up only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patient should not leave the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day , taking place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pt@@ ep@@ tic Ul@@ cus , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty ( see section 4.3 ) .
o@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cords , were reported in patients under the oral of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( sometimes these were severe and required a hospital instructions ) .
the doctor therefore should point attention to all the signs and symptoms that should be pointed out on possible responses such as Dy@@ n@@ ag@@ ie , pain at swal@@ lowing or retro@@ spec@@ tively pain or new or f@@ lim@@ ated pain ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 . the risk of serious adverse events seems to be increased in patients that do not use the medicine and / or after the onset of symptoms that point to a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing assign@@ ments will be given to patients and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
during large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , some were rare ( after market launch ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , among them some severe and associated with complications ( see section 4.8 ) .

there are no data available , the indications that the setting of a bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who require a kie@@ ffer surgical procedure , lowers the risk of an o@@ ste@@ on@@ dro@@ sis of the ja@@ w .
the clinical assessment of the treated physician is crucial for the treatment planning in every patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should have to depend on taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning , after having noticed their so@@ unding .
they should not take two tablets the same day , but taking one tablet per week like originally planned on the week &apos;s week@@ day .
other diseases resulting in the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE prior to start of therapy .
alcoholic beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once they may be taken at the same time .
therefore patients have to wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interventions were not performed , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in clinical trials have been taken jointly with a variety of typically prescribed drugs , without having clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only provided for use in post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , therefore neither during pregnancy nor of lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ dr@@ y@@ on@@ ate do not allow a note to be found directly with regard to the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ dro@@ sis of the ja@@ w was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ onate . most reports come from cancer patients , but also was reported in o@@ steopor@@ osis .
the serum cal@@ ci@@ ums rose to &lt; 8.0 mg / l ( 2,0 m@@ mol / l ) and the serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2@@ mg / l ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mol / l ) in both treatment groups with a similar frequency .

the bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in o@@ steopor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective when at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day taken .
in healthy volunteers the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to any clinical significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of algae growth ( increase in average of 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats revealed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one distributed themselves after the intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg temporarily , but quickly divided into the bones or divided with the urine .
during the intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive produced substance was eliminated in 72 hours with the urine . few or no radio@@ activity was found in the threads .
after the intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance from Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was 71 ml / min and the systemic cle@@ ance exceeded not 200 ml / min .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by rats via the aci@@ dic or bas@@ al transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not believed to have influenced the loss of other medicines by these transport systems .

in the absence of radioactive , vitamin D3 at healthy volunteers the mean ex@@ position of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the cases after 4 days 4.9 % .
characteristics of clinical studies have shown that the percentage of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bones , quickly absorbed via the urine .
although no clinical data are above , it is still to calculate that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal try to be reduced also in patients with reduced ren@@ al function .

if adult patients administered adult patients , a kidney or liver transpl@@ ant in order to prevent removal of tran@@ splan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ grave / Pro@@ grave is already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ grave and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study enrolled 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transpl@@ antation , with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transpl@@ ant was ter@@ med by a year ( by example investigating a new transpl@@ ant or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) .
in addition , further studies were performed for 119 patients with kidney transpl@@ antation and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ ant and investigated how Ad@@ vag@@ raf in comparison to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft is absorbed by the body .
Tre@@ mor ( trem@@ or ) , headache , nausea , vomiting , diar@@ rhoea ( diar@@ rhoea ) , diabetes , more potassium content of blood ( hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ) , high blood pressure ( hypertension ) and insom@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ ni@@ otic ) .
in patients with various hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ s antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ mb@@ yc@@ in ) or any of the other components may not be applied .
patients and doctors have to be careful if others ( especially some vegetable ) medicines will be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ raf , since the adult dose or dose of the same drug may be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ cop@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transpl@@ ant spati@@ ally treated patients should be able to classi@@ fy or changes in the immun@@ os@@ cop@@ al therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft reactions or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or auto@@ immune disease .
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulations and the corresponding daily dosage ; alter@@ ations of the formulation or regim@@ es should only be made under the tigh@@ tening control of a medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dos@@ ing adap@@ tions must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us remains unchanged .
the dose of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of ab@@ duc@@ ing and toler@@ ability in individual and blood levels ( see below &quot; recommendations )
after switching from Pro@@ grave on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mud should be controlled prior to conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
in day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable as the Tal@@ mud , both with both forms and kidney transpl@@ ant patients .
careful and repeated controls of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mud are strongly recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation under Ad@@ mire , to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate gra@@ ft phase .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low cle@@ ance , can take an adaptation of the vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as for several days until the ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first postoperative phase , the T@@ acro@@ mat@@ us treatment intraven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate will be used to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application for supp@@ ression of transpl@@ antation , the immun@@ os@@ cop@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified .
dos@@ ing recommendations - kidney transpl@@ antation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transpl@@ antation proph@@ yla@@ xis should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dos@@ ing adjustments will be required later , as pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can alter the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transpl@@ antation .
dos@@ ing recommendations - liver transpl@@ antation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transpl@@ antation proph@@ yla@@ xis should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
Dos@@ age recommendation - change from Pro@@ grave on Ad@@ vag@@ raf must have become a transpl@@ ant receiver of twice daily dose of pro@@ grave capsules , so this change@@ over in proportion is 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the whole daily dose to be done .
kidney stones and liver transpl@@ ant After a change from other immun@@ os@@ cop@@ res@@ si@@ va at once daily , the treatment with the kidney transpl@@ ant dose must begin to prevent the proph@@ yla@@ xis recommended in kidney and liver transpl@@ antation .
heart transpl@@ ant In adult patients who are surrounded on Ad@@ mire , an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is to be taken in the morning daily .
other gra@@ ft factors of transpl@@ ants in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initi@@ ating dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at intestinal initial dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day , was used in an oral initi@@ als starting dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day .
dose adap@@ t@@ ations in special patient groups patients with reduced sperm cells in the targeted area can be needed in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions as a replacement of the dose necessary .
patients with reduced kidney function as the kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dose of dos@@ ing is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum levels , calculation of cancer risk and monitoring of urine volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf In the transition from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ se to a T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy be careful ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the Tal@@ mud in thorough@@ bred , the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of ab@@ duc@@ ing and toler@@ ability of individual im@@ ut @-@ T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ es controls .
it is recommended common checks of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mud during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ought also to be controlled by the conversion of pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ cop@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that could change the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a medicinal product with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ t@@ ations of the dose may require multiple days until the Ste@@ ady State occurred .
the data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the levels of the blood in blood is 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ mud levels of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us lie in the whole blood in the first time after liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and r@@ amp and heart transpl@@ ant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney and heart transpl@@ ants , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used .
this has resulted in serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft reactions or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us teaching or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulations and the corresponding daily dosage ; alter@@ ations of the formulation or regim@@ es should only be made under the tigh@@ tening control of a medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment adult patients with transpl@@ ant det@@ on@@ ment , which proved to be one of other immun@@ os@@ cop@@ res@@ si@@ va as therapies , are still no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation bri@@ bes .
in proph@@ yla@@ xis of transpl@@ ants in adult patients and transpl@@ ants in childhood are not yet known clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation bri@@ bes .
due to possible inter@@ actions of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us clinical effect , the in@@ gest@@ ure of herbal supplements may contain the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant bree@@ ders during a treatment with the vag@@ aries ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rhoea , a particularly careful monitoring of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations appear in the blood as the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations in such conditions .
in rare cases , under pro@@ gra@@ f was known as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy associated chamber or sept@@ um hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid load , and oil .
as with other immun@@ os@@ cop@@ res@@ si@@ va , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes by suitable clothing or using a solar protection with a high protection factor .
if patients who have T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us take symptoms for Pre@@ s like heada@@ ches , changing levels of consciousness , sei@@ zu@@ res and vision of vision should be a radi@@ ographic examination ( e.g. , ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ raf spread , ret@@ ard@@ sticks , lac@@ tose , is very careful in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary gland , Lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ osis mal@@ absorption .
simultaneous use of drugs or herbal medicinal products that are known as inhibit@@ or or induction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and thus reducing the blood values of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels in the same amount of substances that can change CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism to monitor and include the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain consistent concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction with an@@ tim@@ yc@@ ot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ is@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and pre@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism , results in results .
highly dosed , pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute abor@@ tion actions , can increase the concentration of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower .
the effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us with medicines will be met@@ er@@ tified by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 which will affect their metabolism .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ex@@ pose the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tive and therefore increase the hormone position , decisions are particularly c@@ auti@@ ous in decisions concerning recep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ on , and may extend their half @-@ term .
the results of a minor number of examinations on transpl@@ ants canc@@ ers provide no indication that under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ cop@@ res@@ va , an increased risk for un@@ wanted events occur with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy .
in u@@ ter@@ o exposure there is a monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns to the event@@ ual adverse effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( in particular regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .

infections and paras@@ itic diseases How well @-@ known in other high @-@ effective immun@@ os@@ cop@@ res@@ si@@ va is treated with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , who frequently increases the vulner@@ ability of infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ k@@ otic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ ale ) .
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ related progressive leu@@ co@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ cop@@ ia therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
it has been reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ las@@ men including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative disease and skin tum@@ ours in combination with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high li@@ aison to ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins can be assumed that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ able .
mode of action and work @-@ dynamic effects at molecular level wi@@ dens the effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the cell .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ de @-@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal transfer due to T @-@ cell and prevents the tran@@ scription of a particular number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T @-@ cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells , also the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 patients with 4@@ 75 patients who had under@@ gone a pancre@@ as transpl@@ ant surgery in 630 cases were used as a primary transpl@@ ant in 630 cases .
overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies published the observations expressed in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f applied in liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transpl@@ ants to primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
lung transpl@@ antation In an interim report about a recent , multic@@ enter study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients who received either T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 @-@ Rand@@ om@@ isation .
chronic transpl@@ ant transpl@@ antation , the bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after transpl@@ antation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
the patients treated with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treated patients in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases to the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ is had to be converted to T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) when the number of patients who were converted from T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ us ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases where no @-@ acute corne@@ al transpl@@ ant occurred , was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the fail@@ ing transpl@@ ant patients of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us group larger ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transpl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) .
in a study the frequency of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms was significantly lower in patients treated with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients .
a multi @-@ center study with oral Pro@@ grave was performed at 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ as and kidney transpl@@ antation , which received a random@@ ized process T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( per protocol ) of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and then became at@@ taining to the targeted valley level of 8 to 15 ng / ml at 5 .
intestinal Dis@@ counts The investig@@ ational clinical results of a mono@@ centr@@ alised study with oral transpl@@ ants showed 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver , intest@@ ines and 25 multimedia transpl@@ ants ) under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for the early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infection , bone mark@@ er , additional gift of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ists , lead to the valley mirror between 10 and 15 ng / ml and subsequent transpl@@ ant transpl@@ ants ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) .
factors such as low hem@@ at@@ ok@@ al value and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , or one by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for transpl@@ antation observed higher Clear@@ ance rates .
this suggests that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ ad@@ ised before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tions are mainly done through the bile .
the systematic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) on Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was reduced to almost 10 % lower than pro@@ gra@@ f ( once daily ) with stable patients ( 1 mg : mg ) .

adv@@ ent is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a deficiency due to factor VIII , conditioned , inn@@ ate blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorder ) .
dosage and incidence of application must be applied to whether Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or prevent bleeding in surgical interventions .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII , which causes blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles , or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is used under a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA &quot; technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it satis@@ fies for the formation of the human poor factor VIII .
adv@@ ances is similar to another in the European Union . Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate medicines , similar , is produced differently , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years of age , the application of the drug was studied under the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the study study the efficacy of Adv@@ ant@@ ations in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood det@@ ectors were awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; respectively .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ ore@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII .
adv@@ ances must not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive to patients ( allergic ) against the human immun@@ ity factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster egg or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval for the transport of Adv@@ ance at Ba@@ x@@ ter AG in the European Union .
dosage . dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution of the sub@@ stitution set up after the factor VIII factor VIII , following the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
during the following domestic rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma concentration ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / d@@ L ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is over for the patient .
during the treatment process , the measurement of the induc@@ ing dose and frequency of injec@@ tions stim@@ ates appropriate determination of factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ iegel .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII , which are different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 of factor VIII a weight of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ i can not be reached or when the bleeding is not controlled by a reasonable dosage , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be handled .
the appointment speed is supposed to be set up after the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min cannot be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known compensation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII in Ig@@ G Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
the risk , inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk of the first 20 ex@@ position days is the largest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ P ) with more than 100 Ex@@ pos@@ al and an@@ am@@ ne@@ stic inhibit@@ ors , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the re@@ appear of ( lowest tit@@ om@@ able ) inhibit@@ ors are observed .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the application of factor VIII had no experiences during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s biggest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which were all in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( prevalence based on the available data cannot be inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) calculated post@@ oper@@ atively ) The unexpected drop of the blood pressure factor VIII @-@ mirror occurred post PK ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ots was calculated during the time and both factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in plasma and Clear@@ ance Rate showed again sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe rheumato@@ id arthritis ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and predic@@ ts exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients were diagnosed with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with severe inflamm@@ able hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) following anticipated exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously , patients of an ongoing clinical study were 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients to factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analysed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , lab parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statistically significant up@@ trend as well as a persistent peak of anti @-@ ch@@ o cell membran@@ es , but otherwise there was no symptoms or symptoms affecting an allergic reaction or hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity .
in four patients the occurr@@ ence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es were reported in several repeated product texts in the context of the study .

based on the appro@@ vals available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has kept the benefits risk assessment as a positive rating , but considered that the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has on the basis of safety fil@@ s of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ Rs every 6 months , decided that the Auth@@ or@@ isation of authorisation should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited was officially licensed for the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company returns its application to Adv@@ ance of Adv@@ ant@@ in for Adv@@ ant@@ ages of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the soft tissues ( tissues , the other structures in the body connects , surro@@ unds and bases ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that was genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
in the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , there is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; that has been altered to produce copies of themselves and therefore no infection can trigger in humans .
adv@@ ances in the tum@@ ors would have been in@@ jected directly into the tum@@ ors and enable the cancer cells to form again the normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the un@@ defect in the human body using the p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restore damage DNA and kill the cells when the DNA is not restored .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can grow up and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , involving the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of under@@ mining , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP asked the answers of the company presented to him , there were still some questions un@@ explained .
based on the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP created 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of adv@@ ances in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ors bring benefits to patients .
the committee further concerns the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medication .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be made in reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient , harmful .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP that the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently part of clinical trials or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered mode of action &quot; means that the tablets are so comp@@ elled that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is released slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen so@@ wn inflammation of the nose ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a tablet per day , which should be taken with a glass of water or without food .
the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated , once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al grin@@ d ( clo@@ gged nose ) , are cl@@ apped .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug may be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effect dimensions were the changes of gravity of hay fever symptoms that were reported by patients before the start of treatment and during 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated using a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported patients who accounted for a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6,0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who do pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( throat infection ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ ni@@ otic ( sle@@ epl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ entia ( dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied in patients who may be ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ d@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ge active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another drug for allergic aller@@ gies ) , are not used .
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze must not be used in patients who suffer from an angle glaucoma ( increased ey@@ es@@ ide ) , heart rate or blood disease including hypertension ( hypertension ) or hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ gens ( caused by cereb@@ ral hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stro@@ kes .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted a approval for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is in all to swal@@ low ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , break or che@@ w ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used due to the absence of data to in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) in children under 12 years of age .
the application time is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as for long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ he@@ drin can be removed .
after a decrease in the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment may be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who will be treated with a mono@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy .
this is attributable to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors such as bro@@ o@@ cri@@ pit@@ in , per@@ po@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , poly@@ ph@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ drin , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient &apos;s collective , and the data are not enough to address appropriate recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dys@@ functions and do not submit the data to additional recommendations to the dosage .
patients must be informed that the treatment with the occurr@@ ence of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dium , ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as heada@@ ches or gain of heada@@ ches ) must be removed .
in treating the following patient groups a caution : • patients suffering from digital rhyth@@ mia • patients with hypertension • patients with m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in the history of history , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder cancer or bronze age in the history of history .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines would otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reaction or reduce their extent .
in the framework of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which ery@@ thro@@ mb@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , however , clinical inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests could not be significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and those treated with placebo , regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were alone or with alcohol .
this enzyme has not yet been identified for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , so that interaction with other drugs can not be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in vitro @-@ studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a sub@@ strate nor the inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the un@@ think@@ able of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experiences from a large number of contra@@ cep@@ tions , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals can &apos;t be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctor properties of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , aerob@@ ics should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases , it can come to a dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of transport or capacity to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( Se@@ ek , Ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ ars ) and an CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ ading , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .
headache , anxiety , frigh@@ tening mic@@ ron@@ ement , eu@@ ph@@ oria , ar@@ ous@@ al , respiratory failure , ar@@ rhyth@@ ms , thirst , per@@ spiration , nausea , vomiting , preventive pain , dizziness , t@@ innitus , ax@@ ing , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , hyper@@ ton@@ ic or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is particularly likely to treat children , as well as A@@ tropical in @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ ness , pup@@ ill@@ ity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory Cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the expression of expression of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg does not have any effect on standard measurement capacities , including ampli@@ fication sub@@ jec@@ tivity , or the tasks that are associated with the bow .
in controlled clinical trials , an increased incidence of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the recommended dosage can cause additional symp@@ tom@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ ometer or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
it took 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ izing efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets were determined based on the overall co@@ res of symptoms ( except s@@ mu@@ cos@@ m@@ ret@@ inal swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy involving pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ he@@ drin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets in regards to ab@@ ov@@ ing effect , determined based on the nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ le corru@@ g@@ ation , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ nic@@ ity patient groups .
within a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
following the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers on 14 days the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was reached in day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ ing study , which was performed with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine bad .
a component material study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) from pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ he@@ drin , according to the sole offering of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ he@@ drin , was the exposure to the gift of a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety pro@@ ofing , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , for the tox@@ icity and re@@ productions , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine cannot recognize any particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no bigger tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ he@@ drin .
in reproductive studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic to a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 the application adopted by Pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ anz@@ System is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allergic symptoms by preventing them that hist@@ amine , a physical substance , its effect can be un@@ folding .

after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , very rarely has been reported of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ st@@ ling of breathing , it@@ ching , neck and swelling ) or skin attacks .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach pain , diarrhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , dizziness , dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , muscle pain , sei@@ zu@@ res , inci@@ dents of liver infection and about cases of remarkable liver values also became very rare .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophi@@ lic tablet ( tablet , dissolve in mouth ) , 2.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for inser@@ ting .
for children aged 2 to 5 years the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is available in form of 2.5 ml Sir@@ up or respectively .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml Sir@@ up or respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had asthma patients ) .
the effectiveness was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of quad@@ ru@@ ding , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and efficiency on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies were presented to demonstrate that the body increases the syrup , the solution , and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children are un@@ think@@ able .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us became an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tica , the decrease in the symptoms after six weeks was treated with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % of patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied in patients who may be ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to grant approval for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to relie@@ ve symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and elem@@ ental ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experiences of clinical trials for the efficacy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections of 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should occur according to the previous disease process and can be termin@@ ated again after the sound of symptoms and occur at their repet@@ ition again .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during the time of the performance .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not determined in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets which were administered in addition to ery@@ thro@@ mb@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol has not been reinforced with the intake of alcohol and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases , it can come in very rare cases , which can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic , or the ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events which was reported more frequently than placebo was fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth drying ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) .
a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common adverse effect of heada@@ ches , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study that were administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine fold clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory Cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the expression of expression of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses , in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was administered over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval revealed .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg does not affect any effect on standard measurement capacities , including ampli@@ fication sub@@ jec@@ tivity , or the tasks that are associated with the bow .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in treating the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be classified in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
Per@@ sist@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the total co@@ res of the questionnaire to the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , ac@@ eri@@ us effectively reduced the burden of seasonal rhin@@ itis caused by seasonal rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been identified as representative of other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology has under@@ estimated its path@@ ology at different forms and chronic patients can be recruited as much spec@@ tively .
since the history of hist@@ amine is an urs@@ ing factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also expected in other forms of the Ur@@ tica to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the appearance and number of squares at the end of the first dose of Dos@@ age .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines at chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement of the sum of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate the variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients @-@ demo@@ s were comparable with the general seasonal rhin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
there are no att@@ itudes for a clinical relevant cum@@ ulation to once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
this enzyme , however , was not identified for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ; however , drug inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro @-@ studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a sub@@ strate nor the inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ ing study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7,5 mg , meals ( o@@ thal@@ ates , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) does not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were carried out in clinical trials , with a compar@@ ative degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quant@@ it@@ ative differences concerning the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and from Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on the conventional studies on safety pro@@ ofing , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for re@@ productions , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine cannot recognize any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and elem@@ ental ( see section 5.1 ) .
the contra@@ ctual physician should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see below section 4.4 ) and that no data are present which support the treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with as@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , there should be a role in the diagnosis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin testing .
around 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine constra@@ ints and learn a higher sub@@ sist@@ ence load ( see below Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us syrup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are met@@ abolic , is identical to children who normally met@@ abolic .
this drug contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take care of any fru@@ ct@@ ose @-@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ osis absorption , or a suc@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not determined in the context of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets which were administered in addition to ery@@ thro@@ mb@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , intake of alcohol and alcohol has not been reinforced with alcohol influence ( see section 5.1 ) .
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us reported as those treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , administered at up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ stage clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years who came up for an anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ination therapy , received a daily routine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the process of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can extra@@ pol@@ ated on the children &apos;s population .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied to over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied to adults over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased incidence of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets from adults and adolescents in clinical trials have no influence of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ics .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , alcohol was not caused by the simultaneous intake of alcohol induced by increasing alcohol induced by an increase of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reducing the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the total co@@ res of the questionnaire to the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets dimin@@ ished the allergic allergic rhin@@ itis caused by seasonal rhin@@ itis
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the appearance and number of squares at the end of the first dose of Dos@@ age .
the prevalence of this limited phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Caucas@@ ia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the Sir@@ up@@ form@@ ulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which are affected .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was approximately 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ale half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no att@@ itudes for a clinical relevant active ingredient @-@ cum@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable to p@@ at@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with the recommended doses of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup in a dose of 5 mg .
this enzyme for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , was not identified yet , so that interaction with other drugs can not be excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III brown fabric with child @-@ safe polypropylene sealing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ ystyrene spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2,5 ml and 5 ml or with an application injection for preparations for the intake of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at once daily put in the mouth , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and elem@@ ental ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster needs to be carefully opened and the dose of ly@@ ophi@@ lic is to be taken , without dam@@ aging them .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not determined in the context of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets which have been applied in addition to ery@@ thro@@ mb@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were reported in patients treated with placebo .
in a multiple dose study carried out by up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ stage clinical dose ) , clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , display characters , and EC@@ G intervals .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses , in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied to over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) has been applied over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , an increased incidence of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melt tablets once daily put into the mouth , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and elem@@ ental ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experiences of clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 )
immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster needs to be carefully opened and the dose of processed tablets are taken without dam@@ aging them .
the effectiveness and in@@ conc@@ ei@@ ving of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets at the treatment of children under 6 years have not been detected until now .
the overall incidence of adverse events between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ up@@ - and the placebo group had declined significantly and was not significantly reduced from the safety profile in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets proved to be equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for a company formulation .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses , in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied to over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically .
in a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg does not have any effect on standard measurement capacities , including ampli@@ fication sub@@ jec@@ tivity , or the tasks that are associated with the bow .
the spread of this badly met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and lower patients ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients , however , was not devi@@ ating from the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at , the formulation were organic equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined at p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients , in conjunction with the Dos@@ age studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for a@@ eri@@ us melt the use of the 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years .

at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us was 5 mg of melting tablets as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for a company formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses , in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied to over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg does not have any effect on standard measurement capacities , including ampli@@ fication sub@@ jec@@ tivity , or the tasks that are associated with the bow .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reducing the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg , melting tablets containing A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at were the formulation of organic equivalent .
the total analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical trials for the melting tablets revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation using clinical use .
the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between the ages of 2 and 11 who are easily met@@ abolic , is identical to children who normally met@@ abolic .
this drug contains Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take care of any fru@@ ct@@ os@@ - int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ite absorption , or a suc@@ cin@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group , similar to the placebo group .
with infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events of adverse events were more common than placebo , diar@@ rhoea ( 3.7 % ) , a fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ epl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study included a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution for inser@@ ting no side effects in patients at the age between 6 and 11 years .
in the recommended dos@@ ages , plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see below Section 5.2 ) were similar in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased incidence of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis in an alternative .
as demonstrated by the total co@@ res of the questionnaire to the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , ac@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden of seasonal rhin@@ itis caused by seasonal rhin@@ itis .
the prevalence of this limited phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Caucas@@ ia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
because A@@ eri@@ us solution does not contain the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , there was no bio@@ equi@@ valence study , and it is expected to meet the syrup and the tablets .
in various single dose studies it showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable in p@@ at@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with the recommended doses of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup in a dose of 5 mg .

Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) in June 2008 that the company re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed his application for the in@@ junction of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza In@@ flu@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people for the protection against flu , caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine , which may cause a strain of influenza virus that may cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus appears , which can easily spread to man because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the influenza virus as &quot; physical &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is able to form a rapid antibody in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane gro@@ mm@@ et of the virus , with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , detect the human body as a body ) separated , un@@ ites and used as part of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the extent of the clinical data base for the assessment of the vaccine will not be sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepar@@ atory vacc@@ ines .
if you are interested in clinical examination and require further information about your treatment , please contact your treated physician .
if you wish further information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV ) , which are infected in acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ generic term can be taken as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of these combination cannot be investigated .
A@@ gener@@ ase should then be instit@@ uted when the doctor has checked , which has taken an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient before , and the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood has judged that the virus is to be addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice a day of 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of cases after body@@ weight .
aspir@@ ation decreases in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not cure , however , the damage of the immune system can not delay the development of HIV related infections and diseases .
A@@ generic term was studied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
this with low do@@ si@@ fied past@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drugs A@@ gener@@ a was compared to 206 adults who had previously used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , compared with other prot@@ ease .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or had taken a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , as@@ su@@ stain also reduced the viral load , however , with the children who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug @-@ reinforced drug A@@ gener@@ ase had the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , there came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r a stronger apost@@ asy of the viral load after four weeks than in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are heada@@ ches , diar@@ rhoea ( diarrhea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( F@@ atigue ) .
2 / 3 A generic term can not be used in patients who may be ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against am@@ id@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
as@@ su@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are min@@ ed as aspir@@ ated and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other medicines of HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ a ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ dro@@ sis ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ dro@@ sis ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant immune system ) .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children above four years compared to the risks .
A@@ generic term is generally used together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefits of a generic term in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously not taken any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or are not detected .
A@@ generic term was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; since due to the approval of scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited approval for the hub of transp@@ orters in the entire European Union .
A@@ generic term is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
typically , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are supposed to be administered together with low doses of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ dom@@ avi@@ r should be carried out in consideration of the individual viral resistance and the patient &apos;s pre @-@ treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ dom@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ ting is 14 % less than capsule , therefore , a generic Cap@@ sules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram @-@ basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of amp@@ avi@@ d twice daily together with 100 mg of p@@ avi@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If actu@@ ators can be used without the added addition of kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster packs ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ generic term is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data to in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions at 300 mg twice a day .
simultaneous application should be treated with mild or moderate liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ aker 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r during taking of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that as@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy do not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of a HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ ion , does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV on others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generally , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules are to be used together with low doses of kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver factors associated with potentially fatal course .
for the case of a simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis have increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are to@@ g@@ ging over CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended that the potential benefits of treatment is the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the tri@@ bal function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of treatment with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended for the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ yl@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or threatening effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International Standards R@@ atio ) , are methods to determine the drug concentration .
patients who take these drugs at the same time , may be effective for less effective plasma cutting of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive may be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ eous symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of tox@@ icity due to the high pro@@ long@@ ation content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
as@@ su@@ ase should be set to duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms will be accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or was reported on the occurr@@ ence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an ex@@ cre@@ ation of an existing type of diabetes .
many of the patients had other diseases , whose therapy was necessary , associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated with met@@ abolic disorders .
in h@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( Type A and B ) who were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports about an increase of bleeding including spon@@ tan@@ er sub@@ cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis .
at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients can develop an inflammatory reaction to as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ factor Equ@@ ology is adopted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ cop@@ ia , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ aker 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with minor therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated to increased plasma cutting with severe and / or life @-@ threatening effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to prevent resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the lower plasma cutting through a dos@@ ing increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently un@@ wanted effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be blo@@ ated by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taking St. John &apos;s wort , the amber are blo@@ oming and , if possible , check the viral load and add the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose of dos@@ ing for one of the medicine is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ j@@ r is given together with am@@ big@@ avi@@ r ( see E@@ fav@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increases , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) occurs in combination with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
in combination with cal@@ oric ra ( 750 mg twice a day ) in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the c@@ min values of Am@@ dom@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained in combination of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are given at approximately 40 @-@ 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) is given twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is not recommended to ensure efficacy and un@@ think@@ able of this combination .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , but is recommended because of the anta@@ stic component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , that the proceeds from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
for this reason in combination of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose of dos@@ ing is required .
treatment with am@@ us@@ her@@ ence in combination with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be hum@@ ili@@ ated .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in possibly reduces the concentration of Am@@ dom@@ avi@@ r .
if this medication should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is less effective because of the reduced / or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma concentration .
when these medicines are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be done because an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ dom@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is due to del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in at 193 % and thereby a rise in associated side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to use Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in together with aging , is advised to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are present .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with aspir@@ in in combination with ery@@ thro@@ mb@@ yc@@ in were not performed but the plasma concentration of both drugs could be increased in the case of con@@ current administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg for Fos@@ amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ max K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma , which has been observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may be used together with aging , possibly at inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be supervised to toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with as@@ u@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption dysfunction .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va which are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r can lead to an average of am@@ id@@ avi@@ d plasma concentration .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel blocked , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , cel@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Nic@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ ko@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ id@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of these medicines .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma concentration and increased with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ y , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were employed twice daily with 50 µg flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ ym@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , while the endo@@ genous c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % account interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous treatment of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ es , unless the potential benefits of a treatment weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A Re@@ frac@@ tom@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases of plasma concentration in simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma cutting increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ yl@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended using Am@@ di@@ avi@@ r .
a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations may be recommended up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be increased while the benefit of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r can be increased ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , as@@ su@@ ase may not be applied together with oral in@@ gen@@ itor mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while the use of A@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advis@@ able .
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma cutting of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ op@@ tics , especially if there are even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is to be given such as the am@@ om@@ av@@ irus dosage , when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
while using war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia together with A@@ gener@@ a , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Standards R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or gain of anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods are recommended for contra@@ c@@ eption .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( such as Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous treatment of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied to the possible risks for the fet@@ us in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in milk l@@ ender rats , Am@@ um@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to humans into breast milk .
a reproduction of pregnant rats which was administered by the arm@@ or in the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding of Am@@ hor@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the breast@@ feeding .
the further development of mag@@ ist@@ rates including Fer@@ til@@ ity and reproductive ability was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r on the womb .
the in@@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of these side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase Treatment were slightly up to moderately , compet@@ ed early and rarely guided to treatment break .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with taking ag@@ ul@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV Treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease disease .
most of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not support 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) assessed by the examination as assessed by the study medication , and , with more than 1 % of patients , also listed under treatment of treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ h@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of cereb@@ ral fat tissue , prolifer@@ ated intra@@ oral and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ lic@@ ated fat accumulation ( Sti@@ cking ) .
of 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated persons who had been treated with am@@ na@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was only one case ( Sti@@ cking ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients below In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin rash were usually slightly til@@ ly pronounced , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular paper , with or without it@@ ching and occurred in general during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients can develop an inflammatory reaction to as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low do@@ si@@ fied kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed under a few gener@@ ase treatment ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , who received under general ten@@ glyceri@@ des and CP@@ K values , who received cases together with low do@@ si@@ fied past@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of overdose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary supp@@ or@@ tive measures are necessary .

an an@@ tivir@@ al activity of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r in vitro for HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both on acute and chron@@ ically infected gast@@ ric cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ um@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm at acute infected cells , and is 0,@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ dom@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not defined .
in treating anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , previously untreated Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - such as for other kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r blo@@ wn treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure of 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance analysis based analyses of gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ative systems can be applied to estimate the activity of Am@@ dom@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or insul@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is defined as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , V@@ 8@@ 2A , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / M , I@@ 8@@ 2A , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / M , I@@ 8@@ 2A , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / M , I@@ 8@@ 2A , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / M , I@@ 8@@ 2A , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / G , I@@ 8@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / G , I@@ 3@@ 2A and L@@ 8@@ V , with a reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical contact ( resist@@ ence ) .
conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations are subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current inter@@ pret@@ ative systems to analyze results of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing analysis of clinical vali@@ ant inter@@ pret@@ ative inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ dom@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or insul@@ ates .
firms that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( release points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance testing .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ id@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples creates a certain cr@@ ot@@ ion against kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r , and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r stays in general .
there are currently data to cruise resistance between Am@@ phar@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ avi@@ r resistance fade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , avi@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , avi@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , such as avi@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
contr@@ ari@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; preser@@ ving these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early demol@@ ition of a disp@@ atch therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can affect the subsequent treatment .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , based on vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( Vir@@ us@@ load ≥ 1000 mg / ml ) , along with PI ( 600 mg twice a day ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ a ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , primarily with lowest til@@ on@@ avi@@ r ... &quot; received .
one hundred and sixty patients ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ generic ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis posed the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI group in view to the period adjusted ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ bottom wave of 0.4 log@@ ged copies / ml .
the proof of the efficacy of un@@ baked A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , 152 of which were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase has been given to intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied kn@@ ights at the same time ; the majority of people treated with PI had previously treated at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 B@@ ased on this data should be considered in the treatment of treatment with PI to be expected to be considered the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ challenged &quot; entities .
after oral dos@@ ing , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ dom@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increases , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given together with Am@@ z@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
the administration of Am@@ dom@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dos@@ ing ( C@@ 12 ) .
hence , the minimum concentration in the rift @-@ state ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food absorption is influenced by the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the measured distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg ) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as a perfor@@ ated penetration of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r from the blood stream into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease in the amount of concentration in plasma , with the amount of un@@ connected Am@@ um@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ tied Am@@ spot@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredient during the met@@ ering instrument in the case of met@@ ady drug concentration on the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore pharmac@@ euticals , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be in@@ hib@@ ited or hib@@ its a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules , either 20 mg / kg , or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ um@@ avi@@ r is made up of a solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , a generic solution and a generic term can not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ basis .
also , the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of a kidney function is likely to be minim@@ ized for the elimination of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ big@@ avi@@ r plasma organs comparable to those who are achieved at healthy volunteers under a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ uni@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats represented in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of he@@ at@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , and carcin@@ omas has not been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
of the present assessment data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic use , however , there were little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ations test , micro@@ core tests performed in rats and chromosome tests on human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was am@@ id@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven in clinical use by AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , clinical studies have not been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of treatment .
studies of tox@@ icity at vir@@ gins , which were treated at the age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate in both the control and with the Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r animals .
in case of systemic plasma levels , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure with therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus , and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to a delayed development .
24 If a generic term can be used without the added addition of kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster packs ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application should be contra@@ indicated in patients with weak or lighter liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .

the application strength and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the treatment of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a for up to a maximum of 16 weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to rise for six weeks . • For an tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis , it is covered during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is fertili@@ zed before bed@@ time to the affected skin areas , so that it leaves enough long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to placebo ( same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete abor@@ tion of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and carried out Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete separation of tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on 505 patients with acute ker@@ ato@@ e .

if it is necessary due to the symptoms of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reaction , a treatment break of several days may be made .
the clinical outcome of therapy can be assessed at the end of the treatment after regeneration of the treated skin .
there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , whereas ultra @-@ known basic cell carcin@@ oma should be considered to be suitable .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experiences are not recommended , therefore the use of pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors are not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicates that large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .

this evaluation of clinical signs indicate that in these studies with five times a full treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine was very frequently too severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and heavy incl@@ ination ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ ja was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) in treatment or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dentally one @-@ time oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which equ@@ ates to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clinical serious adverse effect which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ thetic examination , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s top@@ ical use of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 allow@@ ances @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete evaluation of the f@@ eig@@ ni@@ es at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is superior to 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however its effectiveness was measured ( by reducing its effect regarding reduction in the concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the concentrations in urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied to patients who react strongly ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .

treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a physician who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient under@@ wear it , every 15 minutes in single steps increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , defined as each related side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion of the in@@ fusion .
for this reason , specifically these patients should continue to be kept eng@@ aging , and in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be available in a reasonable clinical study , in which re @-@ launch facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies are formed against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment start .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion products must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , risks must be c@@ auti@@ ous due to the theory of an excessive risk reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal experiments are unable to prevent or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there were no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that have been exp@@ elled against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase on breast milk , it is recommended to not meet during treatment using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
these clinical trials were observed in clinical trials affected by 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study enrolled more than 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
un@@ wanted regulatory actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during phase 3 study and pro@@ long@@ ation with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older with a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of upper respiratory tra@@ cts and lungs during pre @-@ history , severe reactions emerged , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ els , respiratory distur@@ bing and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe le@@ ak @-@ form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported , are listed in the table .
100 e / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , within 3 months after the treatment of treatment with a ser@@ op@@ on@@ version , the patients were observed in the age of 5 years with a heavier le@@ ak @-@ form ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or until early departure from the study ) there were no det@@ ectable antibodies at 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients who had never came to Ser@@ oc@@ on@@ version .
patients with a lack of low @-@ physical mirror showed a strong reduction in g@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n while using high antibody tit@@ res to determine a variable reduction in g@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal , to low @-@ neutr@@ alized molecule activity in vitro , which seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted drug reactions typically fell together with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme treatment is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of accumulated sub@@ strate and the preventing of further accumulation of enzymes .

the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled study 3 study enrolled in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , which showed the entire disease range , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient rejected the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had an extended exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3.5 year ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 e / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me had an improvement of lung function and the ability to improve lung function and the in@@ ability that is depicted in the following table .
with an open renewal study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as derived from the following table .
the decrease in the percentage of unexpected FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a Hep@@ @-@ nuclear disease prior to treatment 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study , a normal liver size is .
within the first 4 weeks there was a significant decrease in the G@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inin ) that remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients who have been taken into consideration of a combined end point , clinical correlation was summar@@ ized for five efficacy ( mean in 6 @-@ minute walk test , motion range of the shoulder @-@ joint AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was performed in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined at 20 patients , who were at the time of their intake in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the severe de@@ bac@@ le form and 4 with the middle @-@ run form ) .
in four patients , dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to higher G@@ AG@@ - levels in the Har@@ n in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was diagnosed with the weigh@@ ting form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle @-@ run form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas only limited or no progress in cogn@@ itive development was observed in the cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations were performed on the dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ dos@@ ing schem@@ ata to the g@@ ag levels in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 e / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a represented alternative in patients who pose difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , however , is not demonstrated that long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent .

in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a approval for the hub of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each holding tank must be lowered with 4.2 ml of 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ or sis is taken from the be@@ ech@@ ing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in to first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loung@@ ers - advanced or metastatic breast cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) was administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after graduation from P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² conduc@@ tors is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce frequency and sever@@ ity of skin inter@@ actions a day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid are given .
during the seven days before the initial dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and intake must be continued during the course of the treatment time as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dosage .
patients also have to receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as for each third density cycle .
in patients who received P@@ em@@ etry , a complete blood picture should be created before every gift - including differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and a thro@@ mb@@ cy@@ n@@ ill .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose of dose must be held under re@@ tention of blood @-@ forming or the maximum @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the predicted therapy cycles .
according to the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grad 2 Blood .
if patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 degree 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient is the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if patients after 2 dose reduc@@ t@@ osis have a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of 3 or 4 tox@@ icity or so@@ - at the appearance of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials did not indicate that in patients at the age of 65 years , compared to patients at the age of 65 , increased secondary treatment is established .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to in@@ sufficient data to in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and efficacy .
in clinical trials , patients with a kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min does not require any dose adap@@ t@@ ations necessary for all patients recommended to be recommended .
data in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of below 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 3.0 equ@@ ali@@ on of the upper limit ( near liver , metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( in case of presence of liver metast@@ ases ) are not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored in relation to the bone supp@@ ression of bone and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutral count again gains a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mb@@ al count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute neutral number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ per and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as they are observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ th@@ at@@ on@@ cology tox@@ icity as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ ral pen@@ ia was considered if a pre @-@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients need to be applied to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to contra@@ ctual tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ phi@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended to have a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy , and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , when these events occurred , were appropriate risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation , in trans@@ cellular space , the eff@@ u@@ sions of the eff@@ usion before the cili@@ atory treatment can be achieved .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ etry occasionally , when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated living vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible state of the reproductive system is mixed by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before treatment - G@@ inn@@ s on it , advice on sperm preser@@ vation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ yl@@ ic acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in a high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) with a reduced strain rate of side effects .
therefore caution when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be applied in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the interaction potential using N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ term such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be mixed with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ etry .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ tics and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ last@@ ical chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Standards R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient du@@ es with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ions .
there are no data for use of p@@ em@@ etry at pregnant women , but such as with an@@ dic an@@ tim@@ et@@ abol@@ ites are expected to cause serious birth defects in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be applied during pregnancy , except when necessarily adequate and after careful consideration of the farm for the mother and the risk of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible gran@@ ting of the reproductive ability is mixed by p@@ em@@ etry , men should be pointed out before the treatment start to take advice regarding the sperm cells .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ etry passes wr@@ inkl@@ ed into breast milk and un@@ wanted effects when tra@@ ded babies can not be excluded .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received treatment medicine in the treatment arms ( randomised and treated ) .
statistically significant improvement in clinical @-@ relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , was shown in use of the Lun@@ - genetic symp@@ tom@@ sk@@ ala in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in @-@ arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ id arm ( 218 patients ) .

it is applied in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low cal@@ orie , fet@@ ching diet .
patients who are all@@ i to take no weight loss after 12 weeks , should apply to their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hib@@ ited , they can &apos;t build some fats in the diet , which caused about a quarter of the fats carried into the intest@@ ines intact .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in the two studies on patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who all@@ i 60 mg had a average weight loss of 4,8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 was not able to be observed for patients with relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , flo@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair crisis , du@@ v@@ ets , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , ling@@ ering / o@@ ily chair , ling@@ ering rod ( winds ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .

it cannot be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where not enough nutrients from digestive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or in lac@@ tic mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a approval for the hub of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ent , fet@@ ching diet .
all@@ i must not be applied by children and young people under 18 , because there are not enough data to ensure efficacy and safety .
since Or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ized , it is not recommended upon elderly and / or kidney function in patients with restricted liver and / or kidney function .

the probability of occurr@@ ence gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich snack or fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes should be carried out with an improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a medicine versus diabetes , prior to start of therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic may need to be adapted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as drugs to hypertension or increased cholesterol level , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist , whether the dos@@ ing of these medicines must be adapted .
it is recommended to meet additional swe@@ ating actions to prevent the oral contra@@ ction of the oral contra@@ ction in the case of severe diar@@ rhoea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on inter@@ actions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma seal was observed .
when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia in combination with or@@ list@@ at could be influenced by the Quick values ( international norm@@ ality ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at were the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E , and K and the beta @-@ car@@ otene .
however , the patients should be recommended to take an suppl@@ ementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient amounts of vitality ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a disposable Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one a limited number of volunteers , who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , observed a minor decrease in the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal trials showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , since the absorption of incoming fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the number of things are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
the frequency of known @-@ known side effects that were observed after the introduction of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population un@@ kno@@ w@@ ous size .
+ It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to conver@@ sions in regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
individual doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were given over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight subjects .
if the majority of the reported cases of or@@ list@@ at attacks were reported either side effects or similar side effects , such as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies of human and animal , the systemic effects of or@@ list@@ at can be derived from a rapid recovery of the systematic effects of or@@ list@@ at .

clinical trials was derived from clinical studies that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 presented the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ atory , fet@@ al dose .
the primary parameter , changing the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of the Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of course ( table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average result in the total cholesterol level was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline value of 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( output value : 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol amounted to 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline value : 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline value : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .
at the wa@@ ist size , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg . ( output 10@@ 3,7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( bas@@ eline value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentration of non @-@ met@@ abolic or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after oral treatment of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , with therapeutic doses of met@@ abolic or@@ list@@ at , plasma was only spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml , or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ n@@ mol ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients who were given the minimum system@@ ically res@@ or@@ ated dose , M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed lac@@ tic ring ) and M3 ( M1 after shut@@ down of N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ cine group ) were identified , which presented approximately 42 % of the total pl@@ as@@ inal concentration .

Alo@@ ha is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting are used ( such as C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting are ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicinal product that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ plate ) .
treatment in patients under 18 are not recommended , as the effects of this age group is not enough information .
this means that the substance prevented the binding of an chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , prevented the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemical therapies , which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting .
for chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting are treated , 59 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi was no vomiting ( 132 by 223 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron treated patients ( 126 von 221 ) .
for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ists who are regular trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi were no vomiting ( 153 from 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients suffering from On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with d@@ ag@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 % of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsin@@ g@@ Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer of nausea and vomiting in moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a canc@@ erous disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for preventing nausea and vomiting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thick@@ nesses of the col@@ on , patients should be monitored using an@@ am@@ nest@@ o ob@@ sc@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , be careful when using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or those tend to be such an extension .
except in connection with a further chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics @-@ gift , Alo@@ xi is not being used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron hem@@ med the activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ists not ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ static met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pri@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , the simultaneous administration of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( chlor@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ eti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , nit@@ rous oxide , c@@ ox@@ et@@ eri@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ alin and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies exist not , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary by the treated physician .
in clinical studies , the most common patients with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams tend to follow @-@ up side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) that stood at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in relation , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of super@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity reactions and reactions at the appointments ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dose of similar events , similar events of adverse events appeared as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; no dose @-@ response relationships were observed .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies , because of the large extent volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for al@@ xi@@ - over@@ re@@ do@@ zation .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of phosph@@ orus or 750 mc@@ g / m2 of phosph@@ onate ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of d@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received that was given at Day 1 without the exam@@ eth@@ as@@ ant intraven@@ ous .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine as well as 250 or 750 mc@@ g Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients who received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron based on Day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are combined in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indications of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable to the respective effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels of the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ air@@ ar@@ isation involved to block the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out to 221 healthy volunteers , the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. was administered in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentration in a slow elimination of the body with an average season half @-@ value of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentr@@ ating time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally consistent throughout the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 m / kg while being treated with cancer and cancer patients .
after the intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average intake between day 1 and day 5 measured mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration of 42 ± 34 % .
in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ thetic sim@@ ulations , the overall ex@@ position of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days achieved overall ex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the equivalent intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max according to the one @-@ off period was 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro @-@ studies for met@@ abolic have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lower dimension which are involved in the enzyme CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have been found about 80 % of the dose found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered substance caused about 40 per cent of the given dose .
after a single @-@ time intraven@@ ous bolt , the total body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function problems the termin@@ ale Eli@@ mination time and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , only after ex@@ positions were observed , which are considered to be sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 pre @-@ clinical studies showed evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ air@@ ar@@ isation and extend the action potential duration .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in approximately the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure of human beings ) who were given daily over two years led to a prolifer@@ ation of liver cav@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ m ( in thy@@ roid gland , hyp@@ ophy@@ sis , pancre@@ as , side effects ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time application , relevance of these results is low for human beings .

in June 2006 , the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative expert in which the authorisation of the authorisation for the prevention of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C / ml injec@@ tions solution .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on is like a biological drugs called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same ist @-@ effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference motion &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a viral infection caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ opic study the liver tissue damage has damage , furthermore , the values of the liver cycle Al@@ an@@ in- amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) is increased in blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been incorporated , which stimul@@ ates these to become the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on presented data , which prove the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( Effect structure , composition , and purity of the drug , action of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C the effectiveness of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment to medication ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ print © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document , Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business units only . what were the greatest concerns expressed by CH@@ MP to put the approval for the hub ?
furthermore , concerns relating to the stability of the drug and the effectiveness of the drug may not be sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C that spoke to the treatment of Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on fl@@ amed the disease in more patients than with the reference ti@@ lt ; furthermore , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
in addition to this , the test was used to investigate the question of how far the medicine is immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ust @-@ her@@ ed@@ ent skin infection ) and small in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ated in@@ firm@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ ds ) , to be evacu@@ ated and paraly@@ sed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not used to treat infections which have been demonstr@@ ably created or probably by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resi@@ sten@@ te Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because it may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface must not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not speak to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should further investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works through blocking the bacterial bos@@ omes ( parts of bacterial cells , which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was taken after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients on placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected hood showed Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar contact rates : if the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ ain , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were submitted to treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective in the treatment of abor@@ tion ( vain cav@@ ities in body tissue ) or by infections , which have been det@@ ectable , or probably by M@@ RSA , is not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ clo@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the contractor .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) arrived at the conclusion that the Benef@@ its of Al@@ tar@@ go has survived in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections across the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ities , kill or paraly@@ sed wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . Ltd . approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients who have no improvements to those within two to three days are to be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of awareness @-@ awareness or heavy local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment has to be ab@@ orted carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which M@@ RSA is known as path@@ ogen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of retin@@ am@@ ulin in clinical studies was the effectiveness of retin@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by an meth@@ ic@@ illin resist@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment there is no improvement , or the deteri@@ oration of the infected site .
the effect of the simultaneous application of retin@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been achieved against top@@ ical skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , clin@@ ically important inhibit@@ ing in vi@@ vo is not expected to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous production of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle retin@@ ap@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on the soft skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small systemic exposure after top@@ ical use in patients , Dos@@ is@@ adjustment does not be required if top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have demonstrated a repeat@@ ition of reproduction and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement of impact on birth and the f@@ öt@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a systemic antibiot@@ ic .
in deci@@ ding whether the breast@@ feeding pause / stop or termin@@ ated with Al@@ clo@@ go continued , is between the benefit of a stand@@ still for the su@@ cking and the benefit of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials involving 2,@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , which applied Al@@ clo@@ go , the most often reported adverse effect of irrit@@ ation at the administration , accounting for about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of p@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ aut@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding element of the bacterial bos@@ omes that differs from the ashes of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the bin@@ ocular site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ eric Protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ center .
due to binding on this engagement , P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhibit@@ ing the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ ation transfer , partially P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50 @-@ bos@@ om@@ aler under@@ units .
due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of retin@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms may appear , an advice should be stretched by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ane were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in case of failure to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study of healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was raised daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion and raised on coll@@ ated skin for up to 7 days .
out of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were gained .
the sampling rate was 3 or 4 adults in the adult patients , prior to medication , and between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systematic recording of the human corne@@ al application of 1 % of the o@@ int@@ ment has been lowered to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism of retin@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , low in CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .

there was neither in male nor female rats signs of restricted fertili@@ zation in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thereby achieving an exposure of up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest estimated exposure with people ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 of con@@ flag@@ ged skin ) :

ambi@@ rix is applied to protect against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases related to the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases .
ambi@@ rix is used as part of an existing vaccine , where a protection against Hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , ambient temperature can only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the doses of two doses can be taken into an end .
if a ref@@ uses dose against hepatitis A or B is required , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis C or -@@ B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines may cause vacc@@ ines using the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) &quot; as it can withstand a disease .
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twin@@ rix adult since 1996 and the vaccine is permitted in 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adult and Twin@@ rix children are given in the context of an existing vaccine .
because ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ SAFE adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data collected using the application of Twin@@ rix adult , also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti@@ body concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine is compared to six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two injec@@ tions .
ambient moves between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop anti @-@ state concentration against Hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of ambient temperature of ambient temperature at a 6 @-@ month interval between injec@@ tions was similar .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection , redness , mat@@ o@@ ization ( ti@@ redness ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambi@@ rix may not be applied to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
in August 2002 the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ ica . a permit for the hub of ambi@@ rix throughout the entire region .
the standardi@@ zation plan for the scheme is made up of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose of six and twelve months .
if a request is vacc@@ inated for hepatitis B as well as for Hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B anti @-@ hepatitis B anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibody anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibody values are in the same size as according to vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully assured if immun@@ competent people who are addressed to a vaccine strain which require a ref@@ res@@ ion of protection as they may also be protected from immun@@ ological memory using the immune memory .
3 As in all injec@@ tions , the rare case of a an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction to the gift of the vaccine is appropriate for medical treatment and monitoring always available immediately .
if a rapid protection against Hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the Combin@@ ation agent that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen .
with hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the immune system , under circumstances no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ T and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies are achieved , so in these cases the gift of additional vacc@@ ines may be required .
since intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration should lead to an sub@@ optimal pulse fol@@ lower in the glut@@ eal muscles , these injection valves should be avoided .
during these cases , it can be in@@ jected with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation . since it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding .
if ambient in the second year of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us Me@@ z@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ cul@@ ine m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ cop@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immune defects have to be assumed that possibly there will be no sufficient immune response .
in a clinical study carried out by 3 vacc@@ ines of these formulation , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ o@@ activity , gastro@@ enter@@ itis , headache , and fever comparable to the frequency used in the previous thi@@ omer@@ isation and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vaccination doses have been administered to a total of 10@@ 27 Imp@@ air@@ ings at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years , the ability of ambi@@ rix is compared with the 3 @-@ cans combined combination .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ in@@ ities at a calculation base per vaccination program . however , not on a calculation base per person .
pain was observed according to the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 7 % of the test subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the test , according to the gift of a 3 @-@ dos@@ ing combination .
according to the complete vaccination cycle 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix were given , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ age combination .
however , the frequency of dam@@ aging was compar@@ atively high ( i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the test subjects , the ambient frequencies , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received 3 @-@ doses combination ) .
the frequency of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and mat@@ s was low and similar to which was observed after administration of combination with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old Imp@@ fl@@ ingen , the occurr@@ ence of local actions and general reactions were comparable to the ambient sample with 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen .
however , during the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , it was reported to imp@@ ute a frequent occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dosage , not per tape .
the share of Imp@@ fl@@ es , who reported severe adverse events during the 2 @-@ cans @-@ vacc@@ ines with ambient sounds with 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen , was not different .
in clinical trials which were conducted at Imp@@ fl@@ ingen at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % was one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 arranged dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , a month 6 arranged dose ( d. h . 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study carried out in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of ambient and 147 received the standard suitable foam with three doses .
among the 289 people whose immun@@ ity was ext@@ end@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 , which was significantly higher compared to ambi@@ rix .
the immune response that resulted in clinical compar@@ ative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old a month after the completion of the full vaccination series ( i.e. , 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ piece vaccine with ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen .
persons who were treated at the time of the prim@@ acy between 12 and 15 years , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ T and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies could be demonstrated over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 months .
the immune response observed in this study was similar to both anti@@ gens , which was formed by a combination of 3 doses of a combination with a combination of 360 ELISA and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
a clinical trial of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ T and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies is comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months @-@ vaccination scheme .

you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may potentially make a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot protect completely from infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you have been infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus in front of the administration of both vacc@@ ines or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel un@@ comfortable or ill / feel ) a vaccination may not prevent any disease .
a protection against other infections caused by the liver , or symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis or Hepatitis B infection , cannot be con@@ veyed here .
if you already have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of facial or tongue . • If you have occurred an allergic reaction to a former vaccine against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has an severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against Hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the appropriate administration of the second vaccination price ) .
at a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend to you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective HIV @-@ A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with a reduced content of effective existing ingredients is administered to a month after the initial dose , and should give you a vaccination protection before termination of the vaccination series .
sometimes you are in@@ jected with severe bleeding problems under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child weak@@ ened because of a disease or treatment in your / her body resistance , or if you / your child will under@@ go any hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
ambient can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 Do you have your doctor if you / your child may take other medicines per child ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or when you got vacc@@ inated / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given or that is planned in the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as possible as different lim@@ bs .
if ambient sounds at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
normally , Ambi@@ rix fl@@ att@@ ing or lac@@ t@@ ating women are not given except it is urg@@ ently needed , that they become vacc@@ inated against Hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you already have an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 implic@@ ated doses ) : • pain or complaints at the inser@@ tion or redness • me@@ ability • heada@@ ches • App@@ li@@ ability

ambi@@ rix is available in packages regarding 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les available .
based on the data , which has become known since issu@@ ance of the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP informed the opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambi@@ rix remain positive .
since ambi@@ rix was only introduced in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data is limited to this medicine because of its low patient ex@@ position .
ammon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ adequate enzyme defect or with hyper@@ activity of endemic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage ) as a result of high ammon@@ i@@ ac concentrations ) .
ammon@@ ium is split - split by several individual doses at meals - mixed , mixed among the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( through the abdominal wall in the gastro@@ pod ) or a no@@ blem@@ an ( through the nose in the stomach @-@ leading bottle ) .
this was not a compar@@ ative study , since Ammon@@ ia could not be compared to any other treatment or placebo ( an investig@@ ational medicine , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ium can also be loss of loss of loss in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid re@@ tention , fla@@ vo@@ red pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ pleasant post@@ age or weight gain .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ium is effective in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ure@@ tic cycle to high ammon@@ i@@ ac values .
ammon@@ aps has been approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; due to the condition of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicinal product .
the use is indicated in all patients , with a complete enzyme organ already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 life days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ delay ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life of life ) is then an indication of the application , if in the history of history , a hyper@@ os@@ mos@@ sy en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists .
for infants , children who are unable to swal@@ low , or for patients with swal@@ lows , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated by taking the protein toler@@ ability and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing less than 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early manifest@@ ation to car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny n@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ c@@ cin@@ at@@ ase short@@ age must be obtained in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS pills may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing , as a risk of the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a exists if the tablets will not arrive immediately in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg of sodium ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) of sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ formed heart failure or severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium and in@@ dem@@ or@@ tive clinical conditions only be used with caution .
since metabol@@ ised and separation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in patients with liver or kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency should be used only with caution .
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
when sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ity in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in slow@@ ing slow@@ down of ne@@ ural prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed appeal of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans in breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the breast@@ feeding time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an undes@@ ired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these un@@ wanted events had assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ er@@ azi@@ one fibro@@ us , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of overdose occurred with an exceptional single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) with an exceptional single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ace@@ tic , which showed an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ ing of dos@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is an met@@ abolic active connection associated with acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys with glut@@ amine .
phen@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric acid ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore particularly suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ure@@ tic cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early pre@@ mat@@ urely and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the forecast of early manifest@@ ation with the occurr@@ ence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious disease , and the disease did in treating per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ ues within the first life of life .
due to hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nit@@ ric acid ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ace@@ ae ) , proteins reduced diet and perhaps sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate as new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first lifetime ) diagnosed disorders to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients with many intellectual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest@@ ation of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny n@@ am@@ yl@@ ase short@@ age ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ os@@ cop@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were treated continuously with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical status can occur .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney disease with glut@@ amine , and phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is formed .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after applying a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ lic@@ ting healthy adults and in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ure@@ tic cycle , of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster , and with cir@@ rh@@ osis of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabolism was also investigated in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
in the majority of patients with urine cy@@ c@@ lical disease or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in in@@ opathy was det@@ ectable in different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after a fast fasting a phen@@ yl@@ ate acet@@ ate in plasma .
in three of six patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma concentration were five times higher than the first gifts .
during 24 hours , the medicine will ex@@ cre@@ ted approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine above the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , So@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral dos@@ ing of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either by oral ( babies and children who are still not swal@@ low ) or given a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i or a nas@@ cent probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing less than 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ prot@@ eine in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early manifest@@ ation to car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny n@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to the maximum daily dose .
when rat econom@@ ists were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ li@@ as phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral nerve cells .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ er@@ azi@@ one fibro@@ us , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric acid ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore particularly suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat
on the basis of research on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ure@@ tic cycle can be assumed that for each gram it is produced sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical status can occur .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
during durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this case the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient needs to get the medicine above a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they can &apos;t separate the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulates on the consumption of proteins in the body .
if you follow laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you may take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken if it does not include prescription drug .
during the breast@@ feeding you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine could go over to breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headache , fla@@ vor@@ ing distur@@ ban@@ ces , detection of obe@@ dience , disin@@ formation , memory defic@@ its and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions are observed .
if you identify one of these symptoms , get immediately with your doctor or with the emergency absorption of your hospital at the introduction of a corresponding treatment in connection .
if you have forgotten the taking of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
alter@@ ations of the blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mb@@ als ) , decreased appetite , headache , fain@@ ting , liquid pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , ren@@ al dys@@ functions , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects should be noted , or notice any side effects that are not listed in this manual information .
they may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after using the box and the containers after &quot; use@@ able up to &quot; specified exp@@ iry date . &quot;
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , the contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS pills are of whit@@ ish colour and oval shape , and they are equipped with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; .
30 If you follow laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you may take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken if it does not include prescription drug .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with the same single doses , or via a gast@@ ric f@@ ist@@ ula ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly in the stomach ) or an nas@@ al probe ( hose that will lead through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of Gran@@ ules . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a measuring line over the edge of the knife to remove surplus granite . • Take the recommended number of measuring spoon gran@@ ulate of the container .
angi@@ ox is used for the treatment adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with varying strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart failure ) without &quot; St@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an abnormal measurement of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients that can under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose may be administered and in@@ fusion can continue to be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the major study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination @-@ treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I compared .
while the PCI was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a sh@@ utter ) , and they also received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as o@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in case of prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in regard to all indicators as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox is not to be applied to patients who may be ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or other components .
it cannot be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in humans with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is at the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is an an@@ ant@@ able substitute for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd , a approval for placing on the market of An@@ gi@@ ox in the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ lever far@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in case of emergency grip or when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a standard intraven@@ ous duty of 0,1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if patients follow a PCI in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , and the in@@ fusion of the procedure should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after PCI requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours .
directly before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the input .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consisting of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a sole Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be made .
in order to reduce the emergence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and di@@ lu@@ te medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT is higher than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
patients with moderate kidney function reduction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether using bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ Value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is recommended and use the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt start@@ up again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which led to the approval phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes to the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 . patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis patients is contra@@ ctu@@ ally contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be used 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of low @-@ molecular Hep@@ arin .
• known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active substance or other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or risk of blood disorders . • severe kidney damage and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cr@@ dit@@ is . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully examined during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if at PCI @-@ patients below Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most of the blood in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points may occur in patients who under@@ go a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment of principle can occur everywhere .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Standards R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in again reached the existing level before treatment .
based on the knowledge about the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( Hep@@ ar@@ ine , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ost@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these active ingredients may increase blood haz@@ ard .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with thro@@ mb@@ cy@@ tic aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis are in any case regularly .
the experimental studies are in@@ adequate in relation to the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development of in@@ adequate ( see below section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ question@@ ised hepat@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in Group as well as in the compar@@ ative compar@@ ative groups in women and patients over 65 years was more common than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i measures for heavy bleeding as in Table 2 &apos;s foot@@ notes .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in alone significantly less than in the groups with Hep@@ burn plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ ale , intra@@ ocular bleeding or blood pressure level , hem@@ atology with a diameter of ≥ 3 g / dl without exposed blood pressure , re@@ surgery due to blood pressure , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood cells that occurred at more than 0,1 % ( occasionally ) , &quot; other &quot; points of points were retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following data on side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in on 6000 patients that under@@ go a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in Group as well as in the compar@@ ative compar@@ isons groups in women and patients over 65 years of age occurred more often than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred below Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less than in the compar@@ ative group under Hep@@ burn plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or .
following effects , which are not listed above , have been reported as a comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs in table 6 .

angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ ine , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ in of thro@@ mb@@ in , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as at the an@@ ions region of thro@@ mb@@ in , ir@@ respective of whether thro@@ mb@@ in in liquid phase or at t@@ inn@@ sel is bound .
the binding of bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ ine in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in ex@@ its the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby reducing the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .
furthermore , bi@@ valent Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was induc@@ ted by bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in with serum samples ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past to induc@@ ing no thro@@ mb@@ al ag@@ gregation .
in healthy volunteers and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in shows dos@@ ing and concentrations of anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect due to the extension of the ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if the patient was performed following a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in was given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
in the arm of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ question@@ able Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , in@@ jected the upper arm or the upper arm or administered as permanent in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not provide sufficient insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differ very margin@@ ally of human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter period of action has as a short @-@ effective human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a semi @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 5@@ 72 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body &apos;s insulin does not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance glyc@@ ine hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison with a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin shots .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra versus 0.@@ 30 % in human normal levels .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients who may not be ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH an auth@@ orization for placing on the market of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , the thigh or the delta , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the abdominal wall .
due to the dimin@@ ished glucose capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin supply the insulin needs to be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of active effect , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ ering etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can achieve a change in the insulin requirements .
3 An in@@ adequate dosage or termination of a treatment , particularly in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic acid tin . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin @-@ type or an insulin delivery should be carried out under strict dental supervision and may cause a change in the dosage .
the time of the occurr@@ ence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effects of the used insulin and can therefore change to change the schem@@ as .
the substances that enhance blood glucose concentrations may be increased , oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ en@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , m@@ ox@@ et@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ es , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ iz@@ oly@@ tics such as lad@@ ders , cl@@ on@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reserves the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen counter@@ acts be weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experimental studies for reproductive @-@ curing showed no differences between intra@@ - ling@@ ering and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin @-@ cell@@ ul@@ ses entered into human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ated to oral application .
listed below are known from clinical trials known to those undes@@ ired medication costs ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of use data will not be inv@@ alu@@ able ) .

as a result , Li@@ pod@@ h@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is failed to continuously switch the injection site inside the injection site , in the result , a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy in the injection site may occur .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with consciousness @-@ loss can be treated by a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is prescribed by an appropri@@ ated person , or by the intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose load , the patient should monitor the patient in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripher@@ al glucose consumption ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous gau@@ ze of insulin delivery is faster and the impact time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ cell@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic doses of 0.0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg is a proportional increase of glucose syrup effects , and with 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of glucose levels .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effectiveness of action such as normal human insulin and generates the full @-@ volume of glucose effects for about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was confident that at an application of insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ den@@ ial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as with human normal levels that is given 30 minutes before the meal .
insulin was produced in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ ounces control than with human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes before the meal was reached .
if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar glyc@@ em@@ ic control is given as with human normal levels of insulin ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN : before the beginning of the meal was given before the meal in comparison to human normal levels that was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig . 1A ) as well as compared to human normal levels that was given 2 minutes before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin delivery in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN : afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to a humane Nor@@ - mal@@ ign@@ ant , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
