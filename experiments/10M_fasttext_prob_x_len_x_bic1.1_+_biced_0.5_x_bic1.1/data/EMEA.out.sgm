<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Employment Center (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) is assessed in order to proceed to recommendations on the application of the medication.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your disease or treatment, please read the packing age (also part of the PAR) or apply to your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish further information regarding the recommendations of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tablets (tablets that dissolve in mouth) as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as injectioned solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or sight of things that are not present), mistrust and scales; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental condition which alternates patients with manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat mild to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used to rapid control of gesture turmoil or behavioral disorders, if the oral ingestion of medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">For both diseases, the solution can be used to intake or the melting tablets in patients who are preparing the swallowing of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines at the same time, Abilify should be dismantled, and Abilify should be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter" i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works primarily as "partial agony" for the receptors for neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less dimensions than the neurotransmitter is to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thus avoiding psychotic or manic symptoms and their repetition will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, reappear to prevent symptoms, was investigated in three trials over a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases caused by gestive restlessness, compared to placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo in another study compared to 160 patients in which the manian symptoms were stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared to a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which was involved in increased restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the patient's symptoms were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies through to investigate how the body pulls the melting tablets and the solution for inserting (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies involving an injection solution, Abilify was administered in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms as the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the use for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify was more effective than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo after reappear manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify-injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased more effective than placebo and similar symptoms were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrollable), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), nausea, fatigue (sleep disturbances), insoming (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who had mostly manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazol, confronted with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution for rapid control of gestion and behavioral problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder, when an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Chugai Pharmaceutical Ltd. an authorization for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who have mostly manische episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day when a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day is independent of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not demonstrated although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapies or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="33">A lower initial dose should be considered with regard to the larger sensitivity of these patients (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the start or after change of an anti-psychological therapy, even with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased superfine risk with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be treated with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions which are used for hypotonia (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which one year or less lasting, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazol unfaithful dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients, with ABILIFY, patients treated signs and symptoms of late dyskinics should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient sign signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or clear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics have to be deposed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol in patients with cranes in the history of history, or in conditions that are related with cramphorism in relation to be treated with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazol associated with psychologists who were associated with Alzheimer's disease had patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted deebrovascular events treated with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoazione or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related unwanted events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polythpsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be observed regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally used in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could cause serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effects of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system is caution when Aripiprazol in combination with alcohol or other central-effective drug may be taken with overbearing side effects such as seals (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study involving healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, and therefore, similar dosing reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor"), the common application of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of CYP3A4 into higher plasma levels compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should weigh potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease, should have similar effects, and therefore, similar dosing reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be raised to the Dosage at the beginning of the escort therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Captiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are given together with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3 Methoymorphine Ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should be advised to notify their doctor if she is pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data situation for the safety of human being and due to the reproduction of the animal resulting concerns, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential health is clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to use until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, a total of smaller incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, acathisia, dystony and dyskinies compared to patients who were treated with Haloperiac (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled trials over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients were placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled trial study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripiprazol, and 15.1% in patients suffering from Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manische episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under Haloperiac treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 17,6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks with a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically were significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameter, there were no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol treated patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects that can occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and also in the treatment with Aripiprazol has also been reported in the treatment with Aripiprazol, hereunwanted fragile events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since market launch, unintentional or uncluttered superdosiations were observed with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hematalysis treatment in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose when Aripiprazol has high plasma data.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol is suspected in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptor and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro there was a high affinity for Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity to the Dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergen and to histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks in healthy volunteers, the Positry emissions tomography showed a dosing of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudal and at the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a single Haloperidol controlled trial, 52% of the number of patients who contributed to study medication should be similar to study medications in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary study games, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Depression-scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% among the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Oldaapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study involved in schizophrenia of 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study 'weight gain' occurred below Aripiprazol (N = 18 or 13% of the most valuable patients) compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a flexible dosing of over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol demonstrated efficacy comparable to placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placeboarding and active-controlled monotherapists for 12 weeks in patients with a manische or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed a comparative efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect which was comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the week 12 Aripiprazol also showed a comparative share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on how lithium and Haloperiac.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with a manische or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychological characteristics, which partly over 2 weeks did not affect Lithium- or Valproat-monotherapy in comparison to the reduction of therapeutic symptoms in comparison to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in mantic patients who had reached a remission with Aripiprazol compared to placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar disorder, predominantly with the prevention of a feedback in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro-studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the hydration and hydroxyloy of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkylamation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The medium-center elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol in an extensive metabolic rate via CYP2D6 and about 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") metabolised via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not have regard to clinically significant differences concerning ethnic origin or the effect of smoke to the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe cardiac insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to pull the shots on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety proofing, toxicity in repetitive gift, reproduciicity, genotoxicity and for canoing potential, the preclinical data showed no particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of human beings, so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects surrounding the dose of dosing toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation) in rats after 104 weeks at 20-60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to ten times the medium-ady Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum daily dose of humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugate of Aripiprazol found in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral care of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended daily dose or 16- to 81ple of the recommended maximum dose of man based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, during the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulphate conjugate concentration of hydroxy- Aripiprazol, there were no more than 6% concentration in the study, which were found in the study over 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">These effects were observed for doses of dosages, which resulted in expositions of 3- and 11times of the medium-ady Steady State AUC on the recommended clinical route.</seg>

<seg id="300">Ashelplessness 1 The prevalence of hypersensitivity reaction will be calculated based on a definable case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no problem with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubuli active ingredient, which promotes the costing of microtubules from the tubululcers and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibition of their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibition of normal dynamic reorganisation of microcrotubulary network that is essential for the vitational interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys transzytosis of plasma components in the endothelial cells and has been demonstrated in the context of in-vitro studies that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendotheliorally transport by the gp-60 albuminrereceptor is communicated and due to the albuminous protein SPARC (floated protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the field of tumors appearance.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two inardy-blind studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with Abraxane, which was given in form an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which were performed in form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2, either in the form of solvent containing allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without medication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">When recording into the study, 64% of the patients had an adverse state of condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>

<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity against paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree of patients who lived at a time during therapy a peripheral neuropathy grade 3.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for sound on Baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The drug exposition (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous gift of Abraxane on patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, paclitaxel plasma concentration in multiphase mode took off.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has a wide-reaching extravasculum distribution and / or pasture connection of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-min infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane compared to a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of soluble paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane gift (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro-studies of human liver microsome and tissue coating, paclitaxel is primarily covered with 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolism (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After an 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative figure 4% of the total total dose is less than 1% of the metabolism 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel, which points to a far-reaching non-renal cleance.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public. this document is a summary of the European Public Party report (EPAR) which is explained in the studies as the Committee on Human Rights (CHMP), in order to proceed to recommendations on the application of the medication.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can't be used in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetes drug) can be used together with another diabetes medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin patients (in particular overweight patients) it can not be used with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a Sulfonylharnstoff or insulin, the existing dose of sulphonylharnant or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulphonylharnical or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be enhanced and the blood sugar level is reduced, so that type 2 diabetes improves better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acetone in tripley was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl harnstoff, in addition they received either Actos or placebo until 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycerylic hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that blood glucose levels in use of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg were reduced.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triplea study, the effect of the additional gift of Actos revealed to existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl harnum in a lowering of the HbA1c values of 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease of HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to placebo in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were vision, infections of the upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be applied in patients who may not react sensitively (allergic) compared to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabolic Ketoazide (high ketones - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos was used as part of a monotherapies (in the sole use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a approval for the market launch of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin delivery in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and inappropriate for contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the use of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years no data are available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who threatened to develop at least one risk factor (e.g. early heart attacks or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the physician should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dosage.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oil, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edeme when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced macrovasculine disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study there was an increase in reports about heart failure, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased initial liver factors (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors can be increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard, the liver values are as soon as possible to control.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient had symptoms to point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unresolved nausea, vomiting, thighting stress, tiredness, loss of appetite, and / or darker Harn, are to check the liver count values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision, whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon continued, should be led by the lab parameters of the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon a dosing-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can stem from fat storage and is connected with fluid retention in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hematy leverage occurred in the treatment with Pioglitazon a slight reduction in the middle of hemoglobin (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction of 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 3-4% and hematokrits by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin sensitivity of patients, Pioglitazon is an oral and triple combination therapy with a sulphite-harnant or double-fold combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosing-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, under the treatment with Thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazon, is reported on an occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular dema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between the taking of Pioglitazon and the occurrence of maculaödems to be aware of when patients report about disturbances of vision; a suitable ophthalmological issues should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of messages unwanted events concerning bone breasts of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The effectual incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures near 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) treated with Pioglitazone treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 questionnaires per 100 patient years) with patients who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient needs a pregnancy or occurs, the treatment is decreasing (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies in the investigation of the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon have no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceuticals in digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are meterised by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, Cyclosporine, calcium blocker and HMGCoA reducers are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with fibroblal (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon for 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a lowering of AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under the treatment with Pioglitazon, the pregnancy is reduced by hypertension and increased insulin resistance of the breast milk, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fat growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimated in this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a transitory change of the counter and the index of lentil, as they are also observed in other hypoglycemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT-Ange competed over the threefold of the upper limit of the standard lower than placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or sulfonylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing macrovasculitis was the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency while Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has been reported rarely beyond heart failure using Pioglitazon, however, if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or patients with heart failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was a summary analysis of messages unwanted incidents concerning bone breasts of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing PROACTIVE study, fractures found in 44 / 870 (5.1%) associated with Pioglitazone treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">In taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to act on activation of specific kernel receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator) Receptor-g (PPAR-g), which leads to an elevated insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study of Pioglitazon versus Gliclacid versus Monotherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the therapeutic efficacy (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the start of therapy a blood glucose monitoring (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was observed by Pioglitazone at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite an inadequate optimisation phase, randomized to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">Patients under Pioglitazon reduced the average HbA1c - value by 0.45% compared to patients who continued to provide insulin; reducing insulin injections in the group treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin-quota compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapists with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week evaluation of type 2 diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and a rise in the HDL Cholesterinspiegel as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasmatriglyceride compared to Plazebo, Metformin or Gliclacid, the total plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to Plazebo, a statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel was observed while under metformin and liliclacid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the sober-triglyceride, but also improved the postdensely increased triglyceride level, both over a effect on the triglyceride absorption, as well as on the omic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular risk study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovasculitis in groups were randomised, which received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is resorated quickly, with the peak concentrations of unchanging Pioglitazone generally can be reached within 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV equates to effectiveness in about three times the efficacy of Pioglitazon whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceuticals in digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or Rifampicin (cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive, stamped Pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the rotor (55%) and a lower scale in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma elimination time of unmodified Pioglitazone is about 5-6 hours in humans and all active metabolic rate is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function, but the rates of oral Clearance of the parent's substance is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, after repeated administration, plasma enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiomphy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under the treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces hyperboanemia and increased insulin resistance of the breast milk, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fat growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) were induced into the uretic epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other Thiazolidinones lead to an increased frequency of coontologists.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The effectual incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures near 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) treated with Pioglitazone treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 questionnaires per 100 patient years) with patients who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study about two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were investigated by Pioglitazon or Gliclacid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazone, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin-quota compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the sober-triglyceride, but improved the postdensely increased triglyceride level, in addition to a effect on the tryglyceride absorption, as well as on the biological trygliceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the objective of their primary endpoint, a combination of the entire mortghness, non-deadly myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronarisation, suramputation above the ankles, coronarer rearisation and reascularisation of leg arteries, lay out the results that the intake of Pioglitazon are not connected to any cardiovascular risk.</seg>

<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of messages unwanted events concerning bone fragmentation, randomised, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone and showed an increased incidence of bone breasts in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROACTIVE study, a study over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures near 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) treated with Pioglitazone treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 questionnaires per 100 patient years) with patients who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was performed in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancreas does not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is not able to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">The study was measured after 12 weeks of concentration of a substance (glycollified hemoglobin (HbA1c) which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, which pointed out on it that blood sugar levels were lowered considerably, as with a other human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who are likely to react sensitively (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="1277">To avoid the irritation of the esophagus, the patient may not take up until after the first food intake of the day, taking place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronate and vitamin D3 is already being used separately in pharmaceuticals, which are approved in the European Union, the company presented data before, which come from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also led a study of 35 men and 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis in order to detect the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding the increase of vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who had been treated with ADROVANCE, low (11%) than in those who had only premium income (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also submitted data, indicating that the alendrate dose contained in ADROVANCE is precisely the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculum (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive organs such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), soiling (ulcera) of the esophagus, dysphagia (swallowing), beaten abdomen (blinking belly) as well as acidic tins.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with similar hypersensitivity (allergy) against aldryonate, vitamin D3 or one of the other components, ADROVANCE cannot be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It must not be applied in diseases of the esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who do not stand or sit in at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers the gift of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily over five days) led to any clinical significant change in the oral bioavailability of algae growth (increase in average of 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies in rats revealed that Alendrone distributed themselves after the intravenous gift of 1 mg / kg temporarily, but quickly divided into the bones or divided with the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">During the intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-Alendronate, about 50% of the radioactive produced substance was eliminated in 72 hours with the urine. few or no radioactivity was found in the threads.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After the intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal Clearance from Alendronat was 71 ml / min and the systemic cleance exceeded not 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">Alendronat is not excreted by rats via the acidic or basal transport system of the kidneys, and therefore it is not believed to have influenced the loss of other medicines by these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft reactions or to an increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or autoimmune disease.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulations and the corresponding daily dosage; alterations of the formulation or regimes should only be made under the tightening control of a medical device (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dosing adaptions must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dose of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of abducing and tolerability in individual and blood levels (see below "recommendations)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograve on Advagraf, the Tacrolimus-Talmud should be controlled prior to conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">In day 4, systemic exposure was comparable as the Talmud, both with both forms and kidney transplant patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus-Talmud are strongly recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Admire, to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate graft phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low cleance, can take an adaptation of the vagraf-Dosisschemas for several days until the steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Further dosing adjustments will be required later, as pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can alter the stabilization of the patient after the transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosing recommendations - liver transplantation prophylaxis of transplantation prophylaxis should begin with 0,10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - change from Prograve on Advagraf must have become a transplant receiver of twice daily dose of prograve capsules, so this changeover in proportion is 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the whole daily dose to be done.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney stones and liver transplant After a change from other immunoscopressiva at once daily, the treatment with the kidney transplant dose must begin to prevent the prophylaxis recommended in kidney and liver transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients who are surrounded on Admire, an oral initiation dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is to be taken in the morning daily.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other graft factors of transplants in an oral initiation dose of 0,10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day, in an oral initiating dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at intestinal initial dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day, was used in an oral initials starting dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced sperm cells in the targeted area can be needed in patients with severe liver dysfunctions as a replacement of the dose necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function as the kidney function has no influence on the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dose of dosing is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum levels, calculation of cancer risk and monitoring of urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover to Ciclosporin on Advagraf In the transition from a ciclosse to a Tacrolimus-based therapy be careful (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the Talmud in thoroughbred, the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of abducing and tolerability of individual imut-Tacrolimus-tales controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended common checks of the Tacrolimus-Talmud during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of Tacrolimus ought also to be controlled by the conversion of prograf on Advagraf, Dosisadjustment, changes of immunoscopressive therapy or while using substances that could change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicinal product with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may require multiple days until the Steady State occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the levels of the blood in blood is 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talmud levels of Tacrolimus lie in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplantations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and ramp and heart transplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious adverse events, including graft reactions or other side effects, which can occur in a sequence of Tacrolimus teaching or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulations and the corresponding daily dosage; alterations of the formulation or regimes should only be made under the tightening control of a medical device (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">In prophylaxis of transplants in adult patients and transplants in childhood are not yet known clinical data for retardated formulation bribes.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the Tacrolimus clinical effect, the ingesture of herbal supplements may contain the currant (hypericum perforatum), or other plant breeders during a treatment with the vagaries (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations appear in the blood as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctuations in such conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under prograf was known as cardiomyopathy associated chamber or septum hypertrophy, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders, are an existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, fluid load, and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunoscopressiva, the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of malignant skin changes by suitable clothing or using a solar protection with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who have Tacrolimus take symptoms for Pres like headaches, changing levels of consciousness, seizures and vision of vision should be a radiographic examination (e.g.,).</seg>

<seg id="1450">Simultaneous use of drugs or herbal medicinal products that are known as inhibitor or induction of CYP3A4, can influence the metabolism of Tacrolimus and thus reducing the blood values of Tacrolimus or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus- blood levels in the same amount of substances that can change CYP3A's metabolism to monitor and include the Tacrolimus dose to maintain consistent concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism, results in results.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed, prednisolon or methylprednisolone, as it is used in acute abortion actions, can increase the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus with medicines will be metertified by CYP3A4 which will affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus expose the Clearance of Steroid contraceptive and therefore increase the hormone position, decisions are particularly cautious in decisions concerning receptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of Pentobarbital and Phenazon, and may extend their half-term.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a minor number of examinations on transplants cancers provide no indication that under Tacrolimus compared to other immunoscopresva, an increased risk for unwanted events occur with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and high liaison to erythrocytes and plasma proteins can be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialysiable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and work-dynamic effects at molecular level widens the effects of Tacrolimus through its binding to a cytosic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cell.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcide-dependent inhibiting of signal transfer due to T-cell and prevents the transcription of a particular number of lymphokin genes.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advent is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a deficiency due to factor VIII, conditioned, innate blood coagulation disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">Dosage and incidence of application must be applied to whether Advate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or prevent bleeding in surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII, which causes blood clots such as bleeding in joints, muscles, or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is used under a method known as "recombinant DNA" technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it satisfies for the formation of the human poor factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advances is similar to another in the European Union. Recombinate medicines, similar, is produced differently, so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years of age, the application of the drug was studied under the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the study study the efficacy of Advantations in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood detectors were awarded with "excellent" or "good" respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyorexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances must not be applied in patients who may be insensitive to patients (allergic) against the human immunity factor VIII, mouse or hamster egg or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted approval for the transport of Advance at Baxter AG in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage. dosage and duration of the substitution of the substitution set up after the factor VIII factor VIII, following the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">During the following domestic rhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma concentration (in% of the standard or in i.e. / dL).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process, the measurement of the inducing dose and frequency of injections stimates appropriate determination of factor VIII-Plasmaspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, which are different in vivo Recovery and have different half times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 of factor VIII a weight of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-Plasmai can not be reached or when the bleeding is not controlled by a reasonable dosage, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII-therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be handled.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The appointment speed is supposed to be set up after the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min cannot be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutral antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known compensation in treating patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII in IgG Immunoglobulins that are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk, inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk of the first 20 exposition days is the largest and of genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTP) with more than 100 Exposal and anamnestic inhibitors, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII-product to another, the reappear of (lowest titomable) inhibitors are observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women, the application of factor VIII had no experiences during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs's biggest number of patients were inhibitors to factor VIII (5 patients), which were all in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk for the formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (prevalence based on the available data cannot be invaluable).</seg>

<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 pädiatric patients were diagnosed with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with severe inflammable hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) following anticipated exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously, patients of an ongoing clinical study were 5 out of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins, lab parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend as well as a persistent peak of anti-cho cell membranes, but otherwise there was no symptoms or symptoms affecting an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the approvals available since the initial approval, the CHMP has kept the benefits risk assessment as a positive rating, but considered that the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has on the basis of safety fils of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the Authorisation of authorisation should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited was officially licensed for the Committee on Human Rights (CHMP), that the company returns its application to Advance of Advantin for Advantages of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones, or the soft tissues (tissues, the other structures in the body connects, surrounds and bases) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that was genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In the virus in Advexin, there is a "Adenovirus," that has been altered to produce copies of themselves and therefore no infection can trigger in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advances in the tumors would have been injected directly into the tumors and enable the cancer cells to form again the normal p53-protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the undefect in the human body using the p53 gene, usually contributes to the restore damage DNA and kill the cells when the DNA is not restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not working properly, and the cancer cells can grow up and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient, involving the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of undermining, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP asked the answers of the company presented to him, there were still some questions unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the initially submitted documents, the CHMP created 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of advances in Li-Fraumeni-tumors bring benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee further concerns the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medication.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently proven that Advexin can be made in reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient, harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP that the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently part of clinical trials or "compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered mode of action" means that the tablets are so compelled that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is released slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen sown inflammation of the nose (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a tablet per day, which should be taken with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The treatment should be as short as possible and terminated, once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal grind (clogged nose), are clapped.</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug may be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effect dimensions were the changes of gravity of hay fever symptoms that were reported by patients before the start of treatment and during 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated using a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all grasshoppers symptoms except constipation of the nose reported patients who accounted for a decrease in symptoms by 46,0% compared to 35.9% in patients who do pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under aeropaze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (cardiac disease), pharyngitis (throat infection), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomniotic (sleeplessness), somnolentia (drowsiness), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied in patients who may be ensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenerge active ingredients or Loratadin (another drug for allergic allergies), are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aeropaze must not be used in patients who suffer from an angle glaucoma (increased eyeside), heart rate or blood disease including hypertension (hypertension) or hyperthyrogens (caused by cerebral hemorrhage) or a risk of hemorrhagic strokes.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted a approval for the transport of aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is in all to swallow (i.e. without biting, break or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used due to the absence of data to inconceivable and efficacy (see section 5.1) in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The application time is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as for long-term application the activity of pseudoephehedrin can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decrease in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment may be continued with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze pseudoephedrin contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who will be treated with a monoaminoxidase (MAO) inhibitor and within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to alphamimetic activity in combined use of Pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as broocripitin, perpoid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, polyphergotamine, phenylephrine, ephedrin, Oxymetazolin, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient's collective, and the data are not enough to address appropriate recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunctions and do not submit the data to additional recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment with the occurrence of hypertension or tachycardium, arrhythmias, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or gain of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In treating the following patient groups a caution: • patients suffering from digital rhythmia • patients with hypertension • patients with myocardial infarction in the history of history, diabetes mellitus, bladder cancer or bronze age in the history of history.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before carrying out dermatological tests, since antihistamines would otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reaction or reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the framework of clinical trials with desloratadine, in which erythrombycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition, however, clinical interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor tests could not be significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadine and those treated with placebo, regardless of whether desloratadine were alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">This enzyme has not yet been identified for the metabolism of Desloratadine, so that interaction with other drugs can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4, and in vitro-studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor the inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The unthinkable of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, experiences from a large number of contraceptions, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals can't be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictor properties of pseudoephedrin, aerobics should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified that in very rare cases, it can come to a drowsiness, which can lead to an impairment of transport or capacity to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (Seek, Apnea, decreased mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collars) and an CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, treading, convulsions) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, frightening micronement, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, arrhythms, thirst, perspiration, nausea, vomiting, preventive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, axing, blurred vision, hypertonic or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely to treat children, as well as Atropical in-typical symptoms (mouthness, pupillity and - dilatation, skin comfort, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory Cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastcells / basophiles as well as the expression of expression of the expression of the adhesion molecule on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study involving adults, Desloratadine 5 mg does not have any effect on standard measurement capacities, including amplification subjectivity, or the tasks that are associated with the bow.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, an increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can cause additional symptomimetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tachometer or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhinitis, with 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, histamantagonizing efficacy of aerinaze tablets were determined based on the overall cores of symptoms (except smucosmretinal swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy involving pseudoephehedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets in regards to aboving effect, determined based on the nasal smule corrugation, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Within a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers on 14 days the flow-weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and Pseudoephedrin was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dosing study, which was performed with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were desloratadine bad.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component material study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) from pseudoephehedrin, according to the sole offering of pseudoephehedrin, was the exposure to the gift of a Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety proofing, toxicity in repetitive gift, for the toxicity and reproductions, the preclinical data with Desloratadine cannot recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no bigger toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephehedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrin was not teratogenic to a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 the application adopted by PharmacovigilanzSystem is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the allergic symptoms by preventing them that histamine, a physical substance, its effect can be unfolding.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal rhinitis (hay fever), such as Niesen, ongoing or itchy nose and drink or itchy eyes with simultaneous constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the launch of Desloratadine, very rarely has been reported of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling of breathing, itching, neck and swelling) or skin attacks.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chase, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, muscle pain, seizures, incidents of liver infection and about cases of remarkable liver values also became very rare.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg- lyophilic tablet (tablet, dissolve in mouth), 2.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for inserting.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged 2 to 5 years the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which is available in form of 2.5 ml Sirup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml Sirup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma patients).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of quadruding, impairment of sleep and efficiency on days) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were presented to demonstrate that the body increases the syrup, the solution, and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children are unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius became an average decrease of symptoms (symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urtica, the decrease in the symptoms after six weeks was treated with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be applied in patients who may be ensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, Loratadine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to grant approval for the placing of Aerius in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and elemental (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experiences of clinical trials for the efficacy of desloratadine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections of 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should occur according to the previous disease process and can be terminated again after the sound of symptoms and occur at their repetition again.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) may be recommended to patients during the time of the performance.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not determined in the context of clinical trials with desloratadine tablets which were administered in addition to erythrombycin or ketoconazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, alcohol has not been reinforced with the intake of alcohol and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be clarified that in very rare cases, it can come in very rare cases, which can lead to an impairment of traffic, or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius were reported in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events which was reported more frequently than placebo was fatigue (1,2%), mouth drying (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">A clinical study of 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common adverse effect of headaches, which occurred at 5.9% of the patients treated with desloratadine and 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study that were administered up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nine fold clinical dose), no clinical-relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory Cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastcells / basophiles as well as the expression of expression of the expression of the adhesion molecule on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses, in desloratadine, in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day was administered over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in the desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the neunfold of the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc interval revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dosis- study with adults, Desloratadine 5 mg does not affect any effect on standard measurement capacities, including amplification subjectivity, or the tasks that are associated with the bow.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in treating the symptoms such as Niesen, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can also be classified in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week, and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the total cores of the questionnaire to the quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, acerius effectively reduced the burden of seasonal rhinitis caused by seasonal rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria has been identified as representative of other forms of the Urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology has underestimated its pathology at different forms and chronic patients can be recruited as much spectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the history of histamine is an ursing factor in all urticular diseases, Desloratadine is also expected in other forms of the Urtica to an improvement of symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving the appearance and number of squares at the end of the first dose of Dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines at chronic idiopathic urticaria the minority of the patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of the sum of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and growth, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate the variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, in which patients-demos were comparable with the general seasonal rhinitis population, 4% of patients reached a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no attitudes for a clinical relevant cumulation to once daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">This enzyme, however, was not identified for the metabolism of Desloratadine; however, drug interactions with other medicines will not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro-studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor the inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosing study with desloratadine in a dose of 7,5 mg, meals (othalates, low-calorie breakfast) does not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">Patients with desloratadine and Loratadine were carried out in clinical trials, with a comparative degree of exposure of desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences concerning the toxicity of Desloratadin and from Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies on safety proofing, toxicity in repetitive gift, genotoxicity and for reproductions, the preclinical data with desloratadine cannot recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Color film (contains Lactose-monohydrate, hymopless, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains hymeric, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, mild wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of the meals, to alleviate the symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and elemental (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The contractual physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see below section 4.4) and that no data are present which support the treatment of infectious rhinitis with aserius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomic anomalies, there should be a role in the diagnosis, physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin testing.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Around 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic desloratadine constraints and learn a higher subsistence load (see below Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which are metabolic, is identical to children who normally metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients should not take care of any fructose-olerance, glucose-Galactosis absorption, or a sucrose-isomaltase- insufficiency of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not determined in the context of clinical trials with Aerius tablets which were administered in addition to erythrombycin or ketoconazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, intake of alcohol and alcohol has not been reinforced with alcohol influence (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">Overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at the recommended dose of 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius reported as those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, administered at up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nine-stage clinical dose), no clinical-relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years who came up for an antihistamination therapy, received a daily routine dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the process of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadine in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can extrapolated on the children's population.</seg>

<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of Grippevirus appears, which can easily spread to man because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the influenza virus as "physical" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is able to form a rapid antibody in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane grommet of the virus, with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, detect the human body as a body) separated, unites and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1922">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children above four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Ageneric term is generally used together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefits of a generic term in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously not taken any protease inhibitor are not detected.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Ageneric term was originally approved under "extraordinary circumstances" since due to the approval of scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited approval for the hub of transporters in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Ageneric term is used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor (PI) pre-treated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Typically, Agenerase capsules are supposed to be administered together with low doses of amponavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amdomavir should be carried out in consideration of the individual viral resistance and the patient's pre-treatment (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amdomavir as a solution for inserting is 14% less than capsule, therefore, a generic Capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram-basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of ampavid twice daily together with 100 mg of pavionavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If actuators can be used without the added addition of knonavir (booster packs), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of ampavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of knonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Ageneric term is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the absence of data to inconceivable and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase Capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions at 300 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application should be treated with mild or moderate liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver dysfunctions it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoaker 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations, the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a diminished therapeutic effect of amidavir during taking of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that asgenera or any other antiretroviral therapy do not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of a HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with asion, does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV on others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Generally, Agenerase Capsules are to be used together with low doses of knonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver factors associated with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of a simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including a chronic-active hepatitis have increased incidence of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored in clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluorticason or other glucocorticoids, which are togging over CYP3A4, is not recommended that the potential benefits of treatment is the risk of systemic corticosteroids effects including Morbus Cushing and suppression of the tribal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-Coa reductase inhibitor and simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of treatment with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended for the increased risk of myopia including Rhabdomylolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or threatening effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of International Standards Ratio), are methods to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Patients who take these drugs at the same time, may be effective for less effective plasma cutting of amidavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amidavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive may be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadone is given at the same time with amidavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opiatenteous symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high prolongation content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Assuase should be set to duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms will be accompanied or the mucous membranes (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitor was reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an excreation of an existing type of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, whose therapy was necessary, associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with medication-dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral therapy and associated with metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hämophilic patients (Type A and B) who were treated with protease inhibitors are reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaner subcutaneous hematoms and hemmarthrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factor Equology is adopted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunoscopia, higher body mass index), cases of osteonekrose were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width of Agenerase may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoaker 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with minor therapeutic width of Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are associated to increased plasma cutting with severe and / or life-threatening effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and to prevent resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lower plasma cutting through a dosing increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very frequently unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) can be bloated by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taking St. John's wort, the amber are blooming and, if possible, check the viral load and add the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose of dosing for one of the medicine is not required if Nelfinjr is given together with ambigavir (see Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) occurs in combination with amidavir capsules (600 mg twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, dosages of 600 mg of Amprenavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the effectiveness and unthinkable of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">In combination with caloric ra (750 mg twice a day) in combination with caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of knonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The cmin values of Amdomavir in plasma, which were obtained in combination of amidavir (600 mg twice a day) with caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of knonavir twice daily), are given at approximately 40-50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice a day) is given twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is not recommended to ensure efficacy and unthinkable of this combination.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokintic study carried out in combination with Didanosin combination, but is recommended because of the antastic component of didanosin, however, that the proceeds from Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">For this reason in combination of amidavir (600 mg twice a day) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose of dosing is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with amusherence in combination with amidavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitor would be humiliated.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protease inhibitor and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin possibly reduces the concentration of Amdomavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medication should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin is less effective because of the reduced / or possibly subtherapeutic plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be done because an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amdomavir and Ritonavir is due to delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amonavir and Rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin at 193% and thereby a rise in associated side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to use Rifabutin together with aging, is advised to reduce the dosage of Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data are present.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with aspirin in combination with erythrombycin were not performed but the plasma concentration of both drugs could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg for Fosampleavir and 100 mg of Ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of Cmax Ketoconazole in plasma, which has been observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may be used together with aging, possibly at interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be supervised to toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines, if they are used in combination with asuase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitor it is advisable that Antazida can not be taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it can come to resorption dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulva which are known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with amidavir can lead to an average of amidavid plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blocked, such as Amlodipine, celtiazem, Nicodipine, Nikodipin, Nimodipine, Nisoldipin and Verapamil can be increased by amidavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of Agenerase can increase their plasma concentration and increased with PDE5 inhibitors in conjunction with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypoty, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were employed twice daily with 50 µg fluticasonymonate intranasal (4 times a day), while the endogenous cortisol increased by about 86% (90% account interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous treatment of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended together with these glucocores, unless the potential benefits of a treatment weighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG-CoA Refractomase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced increases of plasma concentration in simultaneous administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma cutting increases of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to myopathy, including a Rhabdomylolysis, the combined application of this medicine is not recommended using Amdiavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations may be recommended up to stabilization of the mirror, as the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased while the benefit of amidavir can be increased (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, assuase may not be applied together with oral ingenitor midazolam (see Section 4.3), while the use of Agenera with parenteral Midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous application of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma cutting of Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with amidavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opiatoptics, especially if there are even low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation is to be given such as the amomavirus dosage, when Amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">While using warfarin or other ororal anticoagulancia together with Agenera, increased control of INR (International Standards Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weakening or gain of anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive is not predictable, therefore alternative methods are recommended for contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (such as Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for simultaneous treatment of Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be applied to the possible risks for the fetus in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In milk lender rats, Amumavir-related substances were detected, however, it is not known whether Amprenavir is transferred to humans into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction of pregnant rats which was administered by the armor in the uterus to the end of the breastfeeding of Amhoravir, showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of magistrates including Fertility and reproductive ability was not impaired by the administration of Amonavir on the womb.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The insolubility of Agenerase was investigated in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of these side effects associated with the Agenerase Treatment were slightly up to moderately, competed early and rarely guided to treatment break.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are used in connection with taking agulase or another at the same time for HIV Treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the disease disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the aforementioned side effects come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), which with protease inhibitors did not support 1200 mg of Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) assessed by the examination as assessed by the study medication, and, with more than 1% of patients, also listed under treatment of treatment (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat (Lipodhystrophy) in HIV-patients, including a loss of cerebral fat tissue, proliferated intraoral and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsolicated fat accumulation (Sticking).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Of 113 antiretroviral not pre-treated persons who had been treated with amnaavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over a medium duration of 36 weeks, was only one case (Sticking) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study at 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients below Indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a medium duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>

<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonekrose were reported in patients with generally known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerase twice a day together with low dosified knonavir (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which were observed under a few generase treatment (Grade 3 and 4), who received under general tenglycerides and CPK values, who received cases together with low dosified pastonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amonavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and prevents the processions of viral gag- and Gag-pol- polytechnic levels with a sequence of education, not infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">An antiviral activity of amidavir in vitro for HIV-1 IIIB was studied both on acute and chronically infected gastric cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood-lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitor concentration (IC50) from Amumavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µm at acute infected cells, and is 0,41 µm with chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amdomavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In treating antiretroviral therapy, previously untreated Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir doses have been treated with protease inhibitors - such as for other knonavir blown treatment schemas with protease inhibitors - the mutations described only rarely.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen from 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg of Fosampvoavir with 100mg of pavid twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred until week 48, with 14 isolates genotypically.</seg>

<seg id="2025">On genotypic resistance analysis based analyses of genotypic interpretative systems can be applied to estimate the activity of Amdomavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir is defined as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, V82A, V82A / C / M, I82A, V82A / C / M, I82A, V82A / C / M, I82A, V82A / C / M, I82A, V82A / C / G, I8V, V82A / C / G, I32A and L8V, with a reduced probability of a virological contact (resistence).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations are subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always attract the current interpretative systems to analyze results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on photypic resistance testing analysis of clinical valiant interpretative interpretations systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of Amdomavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Firms that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (release points) for FPV / RTV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance testing.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amidavir associated genetic samples creates a certain crotion against knonavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir, and Saquinavir stays in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data to cruise resistance between Ampharavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosampaviavir resistance fade, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral therapy (one of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), aviinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), aviinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), such as aviaviavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Contrariavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; preserving these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early demolition of a dispatch therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries which can affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day, based on virological failure (Virusload ≥ 1000 mg / ml), along with PI (600 mg twice a day) and nucleosida (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, primarily with lowest tilonavir... "received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty patients (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Ageneric ase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the part study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis posed the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC PI group in view to the period adjusted (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-bottom wave of 0.4 logged copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the efficacy of unbaked Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, 152 of which were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase has been given to intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosified knights at the same time; the majority of people treated with PI had previously treated at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of patients included in the study included a plasma concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data should be considered in the treatment of treatment with PI to be expected to be considered the expected benefit of "unchallenged" entities.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amdomavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given together with Amzavir (600 mg twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amdomavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amidavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Hence, the minimum concentration in the rift-state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous food absorption is influenced by the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The measured distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as a perforated penetration of amidavir from the blood stream into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the amount of concentration in plasma, with the amount of unconnected Amumavir, which represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of untied Amspotavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active ingredient during the metering instrument in the case of metady drug concentration on the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore pharmaceuticals, CYP3A4 must be inhibited or hibits a substrate of CYP3A4 when they are given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase Capsules, either 20 mg / kg, or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amicavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amumavir is made up of a solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, a generic solution and a generic term can not interchangeable on a milligrammbasis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal cleance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the impact of a kidney function is likely to be minimized for the elimination of amidavir and knonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">This treatment schemata lead to ambigavir plasma organs comparable to those who are achieved at healthy volunteers under a dose of 1200 mg of Amuniavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on the carcinogenicity of amidavir in mice and rats represented in male animals benigne (mice) or 3,8- triple (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of heatal cell carcinoma, and carcinomas has not been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Of the present assessment data on humans, both from clinical trials and the therapeutic use, however, there were little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutations test, microcore tests performed in rats and chromosome tests on human peripheral lymphocytes was amidavir neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical use by AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, however its effectiveness was measured (by reducing its effect regarding reduction in the concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme lowered the concentrations in urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients with over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>

<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusion-related reactions, defined as each related side effect that occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion of the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, specifically these patients should continue to be kept engaging, and infusion of Aldurazyme should only be available in a reasonable clinical study, in which re-launch facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, nearly all patients IgG antibodies are formed against laronidase, usually within 3 months from treatment start.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion products must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer interruption, risks must be cautious due to the theory of an excessive risk reaction after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the onset of infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or antipyigka) to minimize the potential of infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a light or medium-severe infusion response, treatment with antihistamol and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be achieved and / or a reduction of infusion rate to the half of the infusion rate.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of single, severe infusion-conditional reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to consider.</seg>

<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of interference with intracellular absorption of Laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experiments are unable to prevent or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there were no data on newborns that have been expelled against laronidase on breast milk, it is recommended to not meet during treatment using Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">These clinical trials were observed in clinical trials affected by 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study enrolled more than 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted regulatory actions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during phase 3 study and prolongation with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older with a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are frequent (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of upper respiratory tracts and lungs during pre-history, severe reactions emerged, including bronchospels, respiratory disturbing and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted medicines in connection with Aldurazyme, who were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe leak-form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, reported, are listed in the table.</seg>

<seg id="2309">In most patients, within 3 months after the treatment of treatment with a seroponversion, the patients were observed in the age of 5 years with a heavier leak-form (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or until early departure from the study) there were no detectable antibodies at 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay detectable antibodies, including 3 patients who had never came to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low-physical mirror showed a strong reduction in gag-mirror in the Harn while using high antibody titres to determine a variable reduction in gag in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal, to low-neutralized molecule activity in vitro, which seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of Gag in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of unwanted drug reactions typically fell together with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme treatment is in one of the hydrolysis of accumulated substrate and the preventing of further accumulation of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Following iv infusion, Laronidase is quickly absorbed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lynosis. the most probable via Manna-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 3 study enrolled in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease range, the majority of patients from the middle phenotype and only one patient rejected the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an extended expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received another 3.5 year (182 weeks) every week 100 e / kg Aldurazyme every week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme had an improvement of lung function and the ability to improve lung function and the inability that is depicted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">With an open renewal study, an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as derived from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the percentage of unexpected FEV is not significant over this period of clinically and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportional to the height of growing children.</seg>

<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks there was a significant decrease in the Gag mirror in the Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinin) that remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients who have been taken into consideration of a combined end point, clinical correlation was summarized for five efficacy (mean in 6-minute walk test, motion range of the shoulder-joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old open phase 2 study was performed in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined at 20 patients, who were at the time of their intake in the study under 5 years (16 patients with the severe debacle form and 4 with the middle-run form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to higher GAG- levels in the Harn in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was diagnosed with the weighting form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle-run form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed in the cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations were performed on the dynamic effects of various Aldurazyme-dosing schemata to the gag levels in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>

<seg id="2368">Each holding tank must be lowered with 4.2 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary Door sis is taken from the beeching bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with Cisplatin to first-line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with loungers - advanced or metastatic breast cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) was administered as intravenous infusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21-day treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of Cisplatin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion about a period of 2 hours approx. 30 minutes after graduation from Pemetrexate infusion on the first day of every 21-day treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronchial cell carcinoma, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² conductors is administered as intravenous infusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce frequency and severity of skin interactions a day before and on the day of the Pemetremixed gift as well as the day after treatment a corticosteroid are given.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the initial dose of Pemetremixed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and intake must be continued during the course of the treatment time as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexate dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also have to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first Pemetremixed dose as well as for each third density cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who received Pemetry, a complete blood picture should be created before every gift - including differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombcynill.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment course, a dose of dose must be held under retention of blood-forming or the maximum-hematological toxicity of the predicted therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">According to the recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3 which are used for ALIMTA as a monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grad 2 Blood.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients do not develop hematological toxicity 3 degree 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient is the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if patients after 2 dose reductosis have a hematological toxicity of 3 or 4 toxicity or so- at the appearance of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials did not indicate that in patients at the age of 65 years, compared to patients at the age of 65, increased secondary treatment is established.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data to inconceivable and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, patients with a kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min does not require any dose adaptations necessary for all patients recommended to be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Data in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of below 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; 3.0 equalion of the upper limit (near liver, metastases) or &gt; 5,0-fold of the upper limit (in case of presence of liver metastases) are not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored in relation to the bone suppression of bone and Pemetremixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutral count again gains a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombal count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutral number, thromboper and maximum non-haematological toxicity as they are observed in the previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hematological and nithatoncology toxicity as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neutral penia was considered if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients with Pemetremixed patients need to be applied to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measure to contractual toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous intake of non-steroid antiphilic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and reduction (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who are intended to have a therapy with Pemetremixed must avoid taking NSAIDs for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy, and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients, when these events occurred, were appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore in patients with clinically significant liquid accumulation, in transcellular space, the effusions of the effusion before the ciliatory treatment can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with Pemetry occasionally, when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated living vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible state of the reproductive system is mixed by pemetremixed, men should be pointed out before treatment - Ginns on it, advice on sperm preservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of non-steroid antiphylic acid (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in a high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) with a reduced strain rate of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution when patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be applied in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and reduction (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data regarding the interaction potential using NSAIDs with long half-term such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be mixed with Pemetremixed for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetry.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulantics and antineoplastical chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Standards Ratio) when the decision was taken to treat the patient dues with oral anticoagulanions.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for use of pemetry at pregnant women, but such as with andic antimetabolites are expected to cause serious birth defects in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetremixed must not be applied during pregnancy, except when necessarily adequate and after careful consideration of the farm for the mother and the risk of the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible granting of the reproductive ability is mixed by pemetry, men should be pointed out before the treatment start to take advice regarding the sperm cells.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetry passes wrinkled into breast milk and unwanted effects when traded babies can not be excluded.</seg>

<seg id="2610">Treatment in patients under 18 are not recommended, as the effects of this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance prevented the binding of an chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), prevented the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemical therapies, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">For chemotherapies, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting are treated, 59% of the patients treated with Aloxi was no vomiting (132 by 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (126 von 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">For chemotherapists who are regular triggers for nausea and vomiting, 81% of the patients treated with Aloxi were no vomiting (153 from 189), compared to 69% of patients suffering from Ondansetron treated patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with dagetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119% of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolassetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted HelsingBirex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the transport of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer of nausea and vomiting in moderate emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancerous disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for preventing nausea and vomiting, induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a Corticosteroids given to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the thicknesses of the colon, patients should be monitored using anamnesto obscation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, be careful when using Palonosetron with medicines which extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is extended or those tend to be such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with a further chemotherapeutics-gift, Aloxi is not being used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2624">In a population-based pharmacokinetic analysis, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inhibitors (chlorodarone, Celecetidine, doxorubicin, Fluoxetine, nitrous oxide, coxeterir, sertralin and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences for the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies exist not, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women, unless it is considered necessary by the treated physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most common patients with a dose of 250 micrograms tend to follow-up side effects (a total of 633 patients) that stood at least possibly with Aloxi in relation, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of superensitivity reactions and reactions at the appointments (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were given in post-marketing experiences.</seg>

<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentration in a slow elimination of the body with an average season half-value of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area below the concentrating time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally consistent throughout the whole dose range of 0.3- 90 m / kg while being treated with cancer and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After the intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average intake between day 1 and day 5 measured mean (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration of 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">In pharmacokinthetic simulations, the overall exposition of 0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days achieved overall exposition (AUC0- ∞) with the equivalent intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax according to the one-off period was 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated over the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro-studies for metabolic have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lower dimension which are involved in the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of the Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron have been found about 80% of the dose found within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered substance caused about 40 per cent of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single-time intravenous bolt, the total body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function problems the terminale Elimination time and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, only after expositions were observed, which are considered to be sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 pre-clinical studies showed evidence that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in ventricular de- and repairarisation and extend the action potential duration.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in approximately the 30x of the therapeutic exposure of human beings) who were given daily over two years led to a proliferation of liver cavors, endocrine neoplasm (in thyroid gland, hypophysis, pancreas, side effects) and skin tumours in rats but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used high doses and since Aloxi is intended for one-time application, relevance of these results is low for human beings.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) approved a negative expert in which the authorisation of the authorisation for the prevention of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C / ml injections solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon is like a biological drugs called Roferon-A with the same ist-effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference motion").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a viral infection caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic study the liver tissue damage has damage, furthermore, the values of the liver cycle Alanin- aminotransferase (ALT) is increased in blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) has been incorporated, which stimulates these to become the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data, which prove the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (Effect structure, composition, and purity of the drug, action of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C the effectiveness of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment to medication (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns relating to the stability of the drug and the effectiveness of the drug may not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C that spoke to the treatment of Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon flamed the disease in more patients than with the reference tilt; furthermore, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition to this, the test was used to investigate the question of how far the medicine is immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of Impetigo (one with crust-heredent skin infection) and small intoxicated infirmations (Riss- or chids), to be evacuated and paralysed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not used to treat infections which have been demonstrably created or probably by methicillinresistente Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because it may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the skin surface must not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not speak to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should further investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works through blocking the bacterial bosomes (parts of bacterial cells, which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was taken after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients on placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected hood showed Altargo and Cefalexin similar contact rates: if the results of both studies were taken together at Hautwain, about 90% of the patients of both groups were submitted to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective in the treatment of abortion (vain cavities in body tissue) or by infections, which have been detectable, or probably by MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Alclogo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is an irritation at the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) arrived at the conclusion that the Benefits of Altargo has survived in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections across the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmities, kill or paralysed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. Ltd. approval for the transport of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who have no improvements to those within two to three days are to be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of awareness-awareness or heavy local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment has to be aborted carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retinamulin in clinical studies was the effectiveness of retinamulin in patients with infections caused by an methicillin resisthylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2-3-day treatment there is no improvement, or the deterioration of the infected site.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous application of retinamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which have been achieved against topical skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically important inhibiting in vivo is not expected to be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous production of 2 times a day 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the middle retinapulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin salbe on the soft skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure after topical use in patients, Dosisadjustment does not be required if topical Retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have demonstrated a repeatition of reproduction and are inadequate in relation to a statement of impact on birth and the fötal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Retapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding pause / stop or terminated with Alclogo continued, is between the benefit of a standstill for the sucking and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2,150 patients with superficial skin infections, which applied Alclogo, the most often reported adverse effect of irritation at the administration, accounting for about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of pandromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitautus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding element of the bacterial bosomes that differs from the ashes of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binocular site ribosomeric Protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomal P-binding and the Peptidyltransferasecenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Due to binding on this engagement, Pandromutiline inhibiting the peptidylation transfer, partially P-binding interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50-bosomaler underunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of retinamulin at least some infection forms may appear, an advice should be stretched by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the insane were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treatment with S.aureus the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study of healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was raised daily under occlusion and raised on collated skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Out of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% retapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were gained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling rate was 3 or 4 adults in the adult patients, prior to medication, and between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systematic recording of the human corneal application of 1% of the ointment has been lowered to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative Metabolism of retinamulin in human liver microsomites was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, low in CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro review on Genmutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood-lymphocytes as well as in rats microkernest to in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither in male nor female rats signs of restricted fertilization in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thereby achieving an exposure of up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest estimated exposure with people (topical application to 200 cm2 of conflagged skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats the oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (correspondingly to ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development faticity (reduced weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity is determined.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of approval for placing on the market has to ensure that a pharmacovigilar system, as in the module 1.8.1 of the approval application, is present and works before the product is marketed as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The authorization of authorization to carry on the perverse is obliged to carry on detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical processing activities, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and described in the 1.8.2 of the approval application, as well as all the additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP's guideline on Risk Management Systems for the products for Decuse, "the updated RMP should be submitted simultaneously with the next periodic Safety update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms to be treated, select the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams, or lotions on the area that is treated with Alclogo if it has not been prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth, or on the lips, in the nose or in female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the salve look for one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor about advice, if discomforts.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After carrying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterilen bandage or a gazelle band, unless your doctor has advised you to cover the area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is applied to protect against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases related to the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of an existing vaccine, where a protection against Hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, ambient temperature can only be used when immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the doses of two doses can be taken into an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refuses dose against hepatitis A or B is required, Ambirix or any other hepatitis C or -B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines may cause vaccines using the immune system (the natural defense of the body) "as it can withstand a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix adult since 1996 and the vaccine is permitted in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect the same diseases, however, Twinrix adult and Twinrix children are given in the context of an existing vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because ambirix and TwinSAFE adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data collected using the application of Twinrix adult, also used as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine is compared to six months and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient moves between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop anti-state concentration against Hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of ambient temperature of ambient temperature at a 6-month interval between injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection, redness, matoization (tiredness) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002 the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologica. a permit for the hub of ambirix throughout the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the scheme is made up of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose of six and twelve months.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a request is vaccinated for hepatitis B as well as for Hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B anti-hepatitis B anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) antibody anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are in the same size as according to vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured if immuncompetent people who are addressed to a vaccine strain which require a refresion of protection as they may also be protected from immunological memory using the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As in all injections, the rare case of a anaphylactic reaction to the gift of the vaccine is appropriate for medical treatment and monitoring always available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against Hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the Combination agent that contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">With hematalysis patients and persons with disruptions of the immune system, under circumstances no sufficient anti-HAVT and anti-HBS-antibodies are achieved, so in these cases the gift of additional vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intraocular injection or intramuscular administration should lead to an suboptimal pulse follower in the gluteal muscles, these injection valves should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">During these cases, it can be injected with thrombocytopenie or blood coagulation. since it can occur in these cases after intramuscular gift to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If ambient in the second year of a separate injection, Tetanus-, azellular Pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus Mezae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with a combined masculine mumps-rubella vaccine was the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunoscopressive therapy or patients with immune defects have to be assumed that possibly there will be no sufficient immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study carried out by 3 vaccines of these formulation, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matoactivity, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever comparable to the frequency used in the previous thiomerisation and preservative-containing vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccination doses have been administered to a total of 1027 Impairings at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years, the ability of ambirix is compared with the 3-cans combined combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matinities at a calculation base per vaccination program. however, not on a calculation base per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed according to the gift of Ambirix at 57% of the test subjects, compared with 39.1% in the test, according to the gift of a 3-dosing combination.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle 66.4% of the subjects, the Ambirix were given, over pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-Dosage combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of damaging was comparatively high (i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the test subjects, the ambient frequencies, compared with 36.2% of the subjects who received 3-doses combination).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of impregnated pain and mats was low and similar to which was observed after administration of combination with the 3-cans vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old Impflingen, the occurrence of local actions and general reactions were comparable to the ambient sample with 360 ELISA-units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, during the 6- to 11- year-olds, however, it was reported to impute a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dosage, not per tape.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of Impfles, who reported severe adverse events during the 2-cans-vaccines with ambient sounds with 360 ELISA- units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen, was not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials which were conducted at Impflingen at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the serum rates for anti-HAV 99.1% was one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 arranged dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, a month 6 arranged dose (d. h. 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of ambient and 147 received the standard suitable foam with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">Among the 289 people whose immunity was extendable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6, which was significantly higher compared to ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response that resulted in clinical comparative study of 1-11-year-old a month after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e., 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, vaccines received either a 2-piece vaccine with ambirix or a 3-cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA-units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">Persons who were treated at the time of the primacy between 12 and 15 years, the persistence of anti-HAVT and anti-HBS-antibodies could be demonstrated over at least 24 months after immunisation with ambirix in 0-6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was similar to both antigens, which was formed by a combination of 3 doses of a combination with a combination of 360 ELISA and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">A clinical trial of 12- to including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAVT and anti-HBS-antibodies is comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 months-vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose is administered at the time of a combined diphtheria, Tetanus-, azellular Pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with the initial dose of a combined measles mumps Röttine vaccine was the immune response to all antigens.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may potentially make a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot protect completely from infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you have been infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus in front of the administration of both vaccines or hepatitis B virus (although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel) a vaccination may not prevent any disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections caused by the liver, or symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis or Hepatitis B infection, cannot be conveyed here.</seg>
<seg id="2782">If you already have an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itching skin rash, shortness of breath or swelling of facial or tongue. • If you have occurred an allergic reaction to a former vaccine against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child has an severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a protection against Hepatitis B (i.e., within 6 months and prior to the appropriate administration of the second vaccination price).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend to you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective HIV-A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with a reduced content of effective existing ingredients is administered to a month after the initial dose, and should give you a vaccination protection before termination of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes you are injected with severe bleeding problems under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child weakened because of a disease or treatment in your / her body resistance, or if you / your child will undergo any hematalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambient can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons can not be sufficient, so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Do you have your doctor if you / your child may take other medicines per child (including those who have been vaccinated without prescription) or when you got vaccinated / or immunoglobulins (antibodies) have been given or that is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">But it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be vaccinated at separate places and as possible as different limbs.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packages regarding 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles available.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has become known since issuance of the first permit for placing on the market, the CHMP informed the opinion that the benefit-risk ratio for ambirix remain positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since ambirix was only introduced in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data is limited to this medicine because of its low patient exposition.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with inadequate enzyme defect or with hyperactivity of endemic encephalopathy (brain damage) as a result of high ammoniac concentrations).</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is split - split by several individual doses at meals - mixed, mixed among the food or via a Gastrostomieschi (through the abdominal wall in the gastropod) or a nobleman (through the nose in the stomach-leading bottle).</seg>
<seg id="2809">This was not a comparative study, since Ammonia could not be compared to any other treatment or placebo (an investigational medicine, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also be loss of loss of loss in blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, flavored pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant postage or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) concluded that ammonium is effective in patients with disturbances of the uretic cycle to high ammoniac values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps has been approved under "extraordinary circumstances" due to the condition of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicinal product.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, with a complete enzyme organ already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 life days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-delay (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first life of life) is then an indication of the application, if in the history of history, a hyperosmossy encephalopathy exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, children who are unable to swallow, or for patients with swallows, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated by taking the protein tolerability and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing less than 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early manifestation to carbamylphosphate synetase or ornithintranny namylase, substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatase shortage must be obtained in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS pills may not be given to patients with swallowing, as a risk of the emergence of Ösophagusulzera exists if the tablets will not arrive immediately in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg of sodium (2.7 mmol) of sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 grams of sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with conformed heart failure or severe cardiac insufficiency as well as with sodium and indemortive clinical conditions only be used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolised and separation of sodium phenylbutyrat over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS in patients with liver or kidney insufficiency should be used only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">When subcutaneous use of phenylacity in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in slowing slowdown of neural proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed appeal of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacate is excreted in humans in breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the breastfeeding time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an undesired event (AE) and 78% of these unwanted events had assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy associated with lacerazione fibrous, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred with an exceptional single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg) with an exceptional single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetic, which showed an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosing of dosotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacate is an metabolic active connection associated with acetylacetylglutamine by acetylacetylglutamine that is excreted over the kidneys with glutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenchiometrically seen is comparable to phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric acid); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore particularly suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the uretic cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phenylbutyrat can be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early prematurely and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The forecast of early manifestation with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infectious disease, and the disease did in treating peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first life of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hematalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitric acid (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylaceae), proteins reduced diet and perhaps substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate as newborn at postpartal (however, within the first lifetime) diagnosed disorders to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even with these patients, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients with many intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifestation of the disease (including female patients with heterozygous form of ornithintranny namylase shortage), which were treated by a hyperoscopic encephalopathy and were treated continuously with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological status can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that Phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney disease with glutamine, and phenylacetylglutamine is formed.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were obtained after applying a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in solicting healthy adults and in patients with disturbances of the uretic cycle, of hemoglobster, and with cirrhosis of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also investigated in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form 15 minutes after ingestable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urine cyclical disease or hemoglobin inopathy was detectable in different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning after a fast fasting a phenylate acetate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with cirrhosis, which were treated with sodium phenylbutyat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate concentrations in plasma concentration were five times higher than the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">During 24 hours, the medicine will excreted approximately 80-100% in the form of conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine above the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus testing, Sodium polyphenylbutyrat was not treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either by oral (babies and children who are still not swallow) or given a Gastrostomieschi or a nascent probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with newborns, infants and children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing less than 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serumproteine in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early manifestation to carbamylphosphate synetase or ornithintranny namylase, substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat economists were exposed before the birth of phenylbutyate (active metabolias phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the cerebral nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy associated with lacerazione fibrous, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenchiometrically seen is comparable to phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric acid); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore particularly suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess fat</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of research on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the uretic cycle can be assumed that for each gram it is produced sodium phenylbutyrat between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological status can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form 15 minutes after ingestable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During durability, the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this case the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8,6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient needs to get the medicine above a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so they can't separate the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulates on the consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you follow laboratory studies, you must notify the doctor that you may take AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrat can influence results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other drugs Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken if it does not include prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding you may not take AMMONAPS because the medicine could go over to breast milk and damage your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headache, flavoring disturbances, detection of obedience, disinformation, memory deficits and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions are observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you identify one of these symptoms, get immediately with your doctor or with the emergency absorption of your hospital at the introduction of a corresponding treatment in connection.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you have forgotten the taking of AMMONAPS take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>

<seg id="2876">When taking AMMONAPS with other drugs Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken if it does not include prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS with the same single doses, or via a gastric fistula (hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly in the stomach) or an nasal probe (hose that will lead through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take a heaped measuring spoon of Granules. • Strange a straight edge, e.g. a measuring line over the edge of the knife to remove surplus granite. • Take the recommended number of measuring spoon granulate of the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment adult patients with acute coronary syndromes "(ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with varying strength) or myocardial infarction (heart failure) without" St- Hebung "(an abnormal measurement of electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients that can undergo a PCI, a higher dose may be administered and infusion can continue to be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with angina or heart failure to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the major study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) with the conventional combination-treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was often used a stent (a short tubes that remains in the arteries to prevent a shutter), and they also received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as ociximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">The treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in case of prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularisation) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox was as effective in regard to all indicators as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox is not to be applied to patients who may be ensitive (allergic) against bivalentudin, other miludine or other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It cannot be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in humans with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is at the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is an anantable substitute for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd, a approval for placing on the market of Angiox in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (instabile angina / non - ST-lever farction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency grip or when an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a standard intravenous duty of 0,1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If patients follow a PCI in another episode, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, and the infusion of the procedure should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After PCI requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Directly before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the input.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consisting of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a sole Bolus gift from Angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should be made.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the emergence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and dilute medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and administered intravenously intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT is higher than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Patients with moderate kidney function reduction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether using bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-Value is under 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is recommended and use the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt startup again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which led to the approval phase III- PCI study (Replace-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes to the gift of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dosing adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3. patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also with dialysis patients is contractually contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully examined during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalentudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if at PCI-patients below Bivalirudin most of the blood in arterial puncture points may occur in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), while the treatment of principle can occur everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and treated with bivalentudin, a monitoring of the INR-value (International Standards Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value of the treatment with bivalirudin again reached the existing level before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the mode of action of anticoagulancia (Heparine, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombozytenostationshemmer) can be assumed that these active ingredients may increase blood hazard.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalirudin with thrombcytic aggregates or anticoagulancia the clinical and biological hemostasis are in any case regularly.</seg>

<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalentudin Group as well as in the comparative comparative groups in women and patients over 65 years was more common than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined according to ACUITY and Timi measures for heavy bleeding as in Table 2's footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bivalentudin alone significantly less than in the groups with Hepburn plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneale, intraocular bleeding or blood pressure level, hematology with a diameter of ≥ 3 g / dl without exposed blood pressure, resurgery due to blood pressure, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood cells that occurred at more than 0,1% (occasionally), "other" points of points were retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with bivalentudin on 6000 patients that undergo a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalentudin Group as well as in the comparative comparisons groups in women and patients over 65 years of age occurred more often than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred below Bivalirudin significantly less than in the comparative group under Hepburn plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Following effects, which are not listed above, have been reported as a comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with Bivalirudin is immediately abrupt and the patient would closely monitor blood pressure with regard to signs of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalentudine, a direct and specific thrombin of thrombin, which binds both at the catalytic center as well as at the anions region of thrombin, irrespective of whether thrombin in liquid phase or at tinnsel is bound.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalentudine in Thrombin, and with its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin exits the bond of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 slowly, thereby reducing the function of the active centre of thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Furthermore, bivalent Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) was inducted by bivalentudin with serum samples (HIT / HITTS) in the past to inducing no thrombal aggregation.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients Bivalentudin shows dosing and concentrations of anti-coagulatory effect due to the extension of the ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If the patient was performed following a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of bivalentudin was given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention to be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm of the ACUITY study, unquestionable Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, injected the upper arm or the upper arm or administered as permanent infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not provide sufficient insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differ very marginally of human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter period of action has as a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a semi-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 572 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body's insulin does not work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance glycine hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in comparison with a decrease of 0.14% in insulin shots.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra versus 0.30% in human normal levels.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be applied in patients who may not be ensitive (allergic) against insulin lulisin or any of the other components, or in patients who suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra must be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH an authorization for placing on the market of Apidra throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta, or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the diminished glucose capacity and the diminished insulin supply the insulin needs to be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of active effect, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinkering etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can achieve a change in the insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or termination of a treatment, particularly in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic acid tin. these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin-type or an insulin delivery should be carried out under strict dental supervision and may cause a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of the occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the effects of the used insulin and can therefore change to change the schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that enhance blood glucose concentrations may be increased, oral antidiabetic, angiotenin-converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitor, moxetylline, propoxyphes, salizylate and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathizolytics such as ladders, clonidine, Guanethidine and reserves the symptoms of adrenergen counteracts be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies for reproductive-curing showed no differences between intra- lingering and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin-cellulses entered into human breast milk, but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorated to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are known from clinical trials known to those undesired medication costs (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency on the basis of use data will not be invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - silent, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or treading, anxiety, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive dog, headache, nausea, and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">As a result, Lipodhystrophy is failed to continuously switch the injection site inside the injection site, in the result, a Lipodystrophy in the injection site may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with consciousness-loss can be treated by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg) which is prescribed by an appropriated person, or by the intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose load, the patient should monitor the patient in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose consumption (especially by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous gauze of insulin delivery is faster and the impact time is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin-cellinglulisin in the therapeutic doses of 0.075 to 0,15 E / kg is a proportional increase of glucose syrup effects, and with 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effectiveness of action such as normal human insulin and generates the full-volume of glucose effects for about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was confident that at an application of insulin-ulisisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postdenial glycaemic control is achieved, such as with human normal levels that is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin was produced in 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-denounces control than with human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes before the meal was reached.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycemic control is given as with human normal levels of insulin (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN: before the beginning of the meal was given before the meal in comparison to human normal levels that was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (Fig. 1A) as well as compared to human normal levels that was given 2 minutes before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery in gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN: afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to a humane Nor- malignant, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
