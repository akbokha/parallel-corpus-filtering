the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in spite of its small size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some features of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
for further information on the use of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and you will find the built @-@ in functions in the manual &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; you can setup settings . open the card card tools , and select the desired modules .
this is a list with standard installation modules from the K@@ DE ; add @-@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package co@@ de@@ base , which includes &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; before you comp@@ ile this package .
to use the crash @-@ module , click on &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras , you can view the page that brought &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crash@@ es if available , delete .
the add@@ ling filter ( also called the folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar in ex@@ tras . with the module you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current directory on different ways .
to view the DO@@ M construction supervision in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M &apos;s tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document &apos;s displayed area . as default , the display begins with the root no@@ des of the document , example : 1 element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ assemblies of this root pipe .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; displays a further view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different tool@@ bars and text messages to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in printed folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . every object is represented by a rectangle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the inside objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder is reflected in the size of a folder as the sum of size records . in this way , large files can be detected , even if they can be seen far below in the folder hier@@ archy . according to this , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap presentation is a rectangle , which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles offers meaningful colours and labelling settings .
the colour of a rectangle , which is switched from view colour mode , can either display depth for the easy detection of the check@@ box or the figure of another file size , such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rectangle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature , you can design@@ ate if there is enough space available or if the surface is provided by limitations with the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . moreover , you can set the relative position of the inscription on the rectangle .
in Dar@@ em@@ ap for Tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be observed , that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target will not always be able to display the mer@@ ging of entries , and this framework will need place , which is then lost to the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , if the rectangle is square .
as divi@@ ding the area of a entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation will be provided . here , it is necessary for the labelling and avo@@ idance of space loss by frame always beneficial to create spaces that are possible to spl@@ end@@ able . the best methods of this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second allocation .
you can design@@ ate the minimal area for one entry over the menu entry . instead , a sample pattern is drawn into the area of the superior details , to indicate that this area is actually covered by a sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map @-@ wid@@ gets that was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ as .
you can find the picture gallery in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu in the Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

you can also visit the di@@ gi@@ ate ; homepage to visit news about released versions and other information about &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; to learn .
the best start to join &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; participate in the developer mailing list . instruction for signing in the developer mailing list of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; .
if you start &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can simply type p@@ ad@@ names or click on the folder -@@ symbol folder symbol to select a folder .
in the second field you &apos;ll need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many files as you would like to add . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; will additionally be used as an al@@ arium library . att@@ itudes di@@ gi@@ K@@ am
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder as the base folder . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; viewed every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the passage of the folder you get a progress indicator as they can see :
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; dur@@ ations re@@ recur@@ sive to the Library of Library in its whole depth . you can do no sub@@ folder , unless there is a box in hidden folders . you can add extra@@ ordin@@ ator &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; as you enter a point before the name of the folder .
if you take an existing file with photos as base folder , you will notice that the albums in my al@@ yp@@ ad has no photos as symbols . you can change the album by using any photos from the album and this will then be used as an album icon . more details can be found in the section Alb@@ ums .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate your digital camera . after that you should learn how to use my albums and my key box to manage your photos in the albums .

how to setup this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h Work@@ flow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera system will be provided to you with your digital camera and supports your photos directly in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; -@@ albums you can download more than 1,000 digital cameras supported by library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course every medium and every card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate .
modern digital cameras feature the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards , and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) data transmission . the camera is also used as a record drive . the link can also be realized through Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) under any circumstances .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; uses the program g@@ photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also a free , further expanding number of digital cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the machine . since photos are in general big files and transfers via serial port are slow ; it supports these cameras and leads the transfer of images using g@@ Photo@@ 2 . you will find a complete list of supported cameras on this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that the predic@@ tive pictures of di@@ gi@@ K@@ am needs to be read reliably . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may have to look out pictures or the production could be very slowly .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; is how easy the functionality has been extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plug@@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide the modules all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as there is also a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; by writing a small module to complement one function as changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; even carry out .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either switch the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + F .
pull and dis@@ assemble pictures anywhere : you can cancel a picture in another part of the universe , above the horizontal separation line or into another application window . the only restriction is not able to cancel a picture in keywords , data list , or search .
- a file selection permits to extract the common@@ est : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IFF , Ro@@ h , Movies , and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields which are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , fil@@ tering on the fil@@ en@@ ame is shown only if this man is displayed as symbol view . which fields will be displayed in the dialog der allocation settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; creates a organized view of your photo albums . these albums can be stored in a single Alb@@ um@@ tree . these albums can be sorted by the folder , in which the album was created first , sorted by the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ cy properties or by the date of their collection . the date may be sorted into the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select this album Imp@@ orting images . you can also add a screenshot directly to an album . select this album Imp@@ orting Screen Photo .
in order to move or move a picture from an album to another album , you can select the photo using the mouse to move on the target album and then you can select whether the picture is moving through moving or copying . you can also select multiple photos and move them to the target album .

the album date : will be used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by post .
the buttons el@@ dest , average , latest : these set the date on the el@@ dest , the newest image or the average of the album . in addition , it is attempts to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of any file is used in this folder instead .
when you first opened an album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; open , the first picture is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you &apos;ll need to click on the image with the right mouse button and select the context menu &amp; quot ; When Alb@@ um@@ for@@ schau dice , select . in addition , you can drag the photo onto the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be s@@ acked .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; supports the input of key words for individual photos in the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window displays you the main view of your photo . if you select an album , all pictures will be displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two buttons in the tool bar .
when you open an album the first time you need to wait short while the th@@ umb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid in which you can re@@ produce all th@@ umb@@ nails in the menu ex@@ tras .

photos are everything related to &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; works . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures so as it fits you . you can reach all the functions that have with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you can reach the context menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you have the choice between viewing the images , a slide or the editing of the pictures .
you can open the image processing with a photo by selecting either F4 image ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... Select a manual on how you can edit your photos . you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the functionality you need , not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button . for this , and how you can adapt the context menu to the file type . for this , and how to adjust these needs , you will find information in &amp; K@@ DE ; manual .
you should note that , after processing through other image processing programs , you can &apos;t store these data using the related met@@ ad@@ ata . some programs do not store these data using the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; gives two ways to shoot . the easiest is to click to the preview and select rotation . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify degrees of rotation .
to change the file names , you can click to the Settings menu and select F2 name ren@@ ame from the context menu . be aware that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ ti@@ f , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; del@@ eting , it is moved to the tr@@ ash of &amp; K@@ DE ; post@@ pon@@ ed . F@@ 8 image del@@ eting or de@@ f if you prefer really delete you can use this by using Shift ; de@@ f .
the view &amp; quot ; my Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ p@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos on the data . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; use either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , date of last change of file .
if you select a month out of the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with brief reports provide a flexible and powerful option available to organize your photos and catalog@@ ed . tags are stick@@ ers , individual photos or whole groups can be assigned . as soon as a photo is assigned a photo , the photo can be found through the selection of this keyword or search again .
when a keyword is selected , all photos , which were marked with this keyword , are indicated .
tags can be s@@ ort@@ able in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also perfectly organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; You can find out parts of the tree &amp; quot ;
the keyword will be stored in a database for the fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords will notice the loss of the database re @-@ imported when &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the pictures not@@ ices .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or , on an existing keyword , click on a new keyword if you cli@@ cked on an existing cli@@ c , then this keyword will be the first word of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and delete it . if you delete a keyword , the photo is not deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a sample by drag it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once a tree .
you can change the properties of a sample by clicking with the right mouse button and select in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ;
to select another photo as an album icon , you &apos;ll need to click on the image with the right button and click on the context menu . additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
um &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; s functionality with key words have to be used , first you have to look at the keyword on two ways : as soon as you have chosen the photos , you can click on the relevant keyword on tree &amp; quot ; . alternatively , you can click on the keyword on the look of the pictures and select from the context menu .
you can choose a photo of any number of words . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keyword on it , select one keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was done , one for the event , where it has been made etc .
once you have signed a photo with brief , this will be shown below the preview of the picture in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the cont@@ ex@@ tual menu pop@@ up menu and remove from the key menu . the menu shows you just the tags that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ etable display shows a tim@@ ely adjusted hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . in order to select a sched@@ ules , you can only click on the lower right of the box frame , which gives the time unit . as a result , all matching images are displayed in the main window .
in the bottom , you can enter a title and store your selection . then it appears in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp , and in the future more .
Neb@@ ch@@ er Such@@ box is a small lamp the green if the search results will find . if you click here the fil@@ tering is deleted , and all images are displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp is red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . however , you can save this search here but as a live search , always the filter what you have entered as search criteria . after you were log@@ ged , he was stored in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and search is carried out . the search list will be displayed in the main window . if you want to change your search back in my search list . if you select your choice after search , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the view of my search list and select one option in his context menu .

if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the context menu .
the Advanced search provides you an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in specific fields of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; s database can look for .
the list of search rules will be used to set the options for a search qu@@ ery in the Alb@@ end@@ ate bank . all rules can be added or deleted by operators . any option can be associated with other over the logical operations all ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... Select a type &amp; quot ; AND N@@ ICH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; each picture is characterised by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . these enables images to compare these sign@@ atures . the lower the difference between two image sign@@ atures , the more they conform to it . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a range in which you can fall into any image , to find a similar picture . by using a swelling , the results can be enlarged or reduced . if you can insert a picture from somewhere over the symbol of un@@ precise search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sk@@ etch : free color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; finds the appropriate pictures . also here , a swelling can be set .
this tab displays an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button in order to move a square . all images inside this coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this is prec@@ eded by your pictures Ge@@ o data .
in the bottom , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o @-@ filters . this will then add a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ ord@@ ner .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; introduces a lumin@@ ous in a separate window with which you can compare pictures . it works with all supported image files , also raw files , together .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The ligh@@ test is added and its window opens . if you are back in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; main window , you can open the lumin@@ ous quickly with L Extras .
from the fore@@ see , you can compare the pictures you want to compare , to the left or right field of the window . if you can preview it out of the tool@@ bar and execute Zoo or shift operations on one of the pictures , then you can compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better to use quickly from a picture series . if you use pair @-@ wise directly from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically displayed in any template to display it in the left side . this is simplified in the right area . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures .
of course , normal soldering work also work directly from the lumin@@ ous , e.g. F4 file extensions ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both models in the lumin@@ ous table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure time .
in the lower end of each area you &apos;ll find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can view to the visible range of the image , you need to click on to the visible range of the image . then both images will show the same image range .
the zo@@ oming also works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom @-@ controllers under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out to zoom . this happens in both pictures when you look at mode .
what is a digital survey administration - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers any part of the process after the image has been made up to the final edition and the permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , sc@@ ans or digital photos does the form of digital surveys . however , most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to backup your pictures , use , protect and use photos . we look at the procedures for digital photographs the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; use , evaluate , re@@ alizing , re@@ alizing , optimi@@ zing , optimi@@ zing , optimi@@ zing , optimi@@ zing , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , trans@@ forms , conden@@ sed and exported content that hab@@ it a mon@@ et@@ ype or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are according to your definition data , information on or documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I dare to argue that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will not need to find any certain photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; . the base met@@ ad@@ ata is guaranteed in a database as well as in the image files , very fast search and create a secure archi@@ ving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and need to know before you want something in your system . your image files must somehow be arranged on your computer . you must decide if you want to save others to your computer , whether you want to store them on a network drive &amp; etc . please note that you need to switch to a larger drive at some point .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . tourist pictures can be found quickly over your location . if you &apos;re doing enough photos , you &apos;ll be able to use sub@@ folder like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of pictures to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work@@ files have and you will not want to re@@ organise your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . separate new files .
the separation of original and working files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the site of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by choosing the corresponding item in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? for this purpose , &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should select any photo keywords , inscri@@ ptions and an evaluation . of course you can select all the images that will need the same attribute and then put the value . it makes sense when you can focus on the best photos on the best photos .
let us now take key words , key words , as you proceed with other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalog@@ ed pictures from another source with embedded key words , then it gets &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; automatically add the images to the correct position within the tree is no problem , and can easily be done by pulling a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords will be followed by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; updated while it is pursued .
the graphic shows like different met@@ ad@@ ata . this is a very rough representation , since every block of met@@ ad@@ ata is found in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all the pictures .
enough of the keyword - the next section refers to prot@@ ector or comments , the third important tool to at@@ ise your met@@ ad@@ ata .
most don &apos;t want to just see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you &apos;re sure about how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . far the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then start some details , people , the place .
and now I say you this is the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing is . Wow ! one starts to dream associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may possibly even hear the silence . the inscription has changed your perception of this panorama as completely .
for others consider the title perhaps more important than the picture yourself can tell you . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is the meaning to the viewer , to help Him to help you understand what you understand is what you understand .
it is al@@ right when a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength to act with a lab@@ eling for themselves .
with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you can also send a lot of text in an international alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) when lab@@ eling . you can even export it for a selection of pictures simultaneously . if you export your images in Web galleries , then you will have to tell them about your wishes for the labels and / or the title of Web @-@ gallery .
remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Google Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train rides this space already with lighting speed .
the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization will be im@@ min@@ able already . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat the pictures at the recording location . you can also export the pictures at the recording location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice of copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the execution site of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; as a information should be paid :
author ( syn@@ onym for actor and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , for example , to protect the identity of the photographers , for example , the name of a company or organization can be used . if this field does not support Com@@ ma nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author Title ( Syn@@ onym for Constitution ) : linked with the author . this field contains the number of work of the photographer . examples of this field can be titles as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ k to the auth@@ oring field , this field must be completed as well .
editor ( Syn@@ onym for Con@@ sole ) : use the bi@@ dding field to identify individuals who offers this photo . if the photographer has an news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations will be listed here if the picture is a bearing photo , then here the group / agency is the picture here given .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with hosts is able to delete this , in the image of embedded met@@ ad@@ ata . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in every image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; will provide such a module for the st@@ acking processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that went on the road or a fire . this kind of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we will discuss problems with the so @-@ called new media .
cro@@ ll On@@ track , the world &apos;s biggest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which had a loss of data .
in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these c@@ auti@@ ous products must be treated , so you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer to get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers above gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that is a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it is in your sur@@ veying room .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording devices . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about to choose the right .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you were just written only . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for the form@@ att@@ ing and the control mar@@ gins . despite this massive protection they al@@ ps them through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust , etc .
there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications such as damaged disks , hard drives , Flash@@ media , USB drive etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to capture the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slow with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate media . also , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; writer features and then on a clean , dark dry and locally protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
dis@@ manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers guarantee a new disc , but not the data . Google makes a big field study on the hard drives of hard drives to this topic : dis@@ missing information
shortly : Dis@@ ks stay at the longest when you are operated in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperature tracks , the most frequent error cause , SM@@ ART may notice this error . some of SM@@ ART adher@@ es to im@@ min@@ ent failure . this is especially read and re@@ location counter . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power out@@ age before you saved the files but these losses are usually possible without any major problems .
during most electric devices not much , this is different from devices containing computer chips and high @-@ speed spro@@ cket . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause these anom@@ ali@@ es , complete data loss , hardware degra@@ dation , devast@@ ated mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from inev@@ itable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against power sp@@ ik@@ es is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is a portion of energy stores absorbed and the rest is gro@@ unded . however , it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . however , remember that not every plug @-@ bar contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also be careful to protect against lighten@@ ing the protection against lighten@@ ing .
since a transformer is able to use any cables at your computer , you should pay attention to all peripher@@ als that are connected to your system . some manufacturers are also able to provide a phone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and television card .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specifically designed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for on the road .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctu@@ ations in power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a few seconds can result in loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection against over@@ l@@ ash@@ ings , these tools automatically provide rechargeable battery power . if you are allowing you to save your data and run the system , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the life time of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
remember the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security for electricity problems with the cost of avo@@ idance of this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer protects you with it . finally , you should always remember all the cables before you go into the holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is a further popular offer to store any data .
they are compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore only effective against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . that &apos;s why it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available on photos stored on photos . the professional version provides you more at your disposal , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , Web solutions are very secure . data transfer errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the great companies is included in the offer a backup and a sub@@ divided memory . so they are Des@@ ast@@ er@@ proof .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are pr@@ one to transfer errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integr@@ ates between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about it is that no one says if a transmission error occurred , not when it was destroyed in your hardware . it &apos;s quite worried that there is no protection for your computer . no one seems ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more secure data than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable network parts are another source of transfers , since they create inter@@ ferences within the data streams . at normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transfer@@ ring problems , you should look into the future . thousands of mistakes can be seen in 2010 .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems appears to be one of two candidates who can handle turn@@ tables on low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope it &apos;s available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ race file system . this is still in Alpha @-@ Status . it uses the same protection mechanisms the z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in notebook and 46 % for work@@ top systems . not@@ ebooks now amounts to 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most people think . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems such as theft , or new installations ; and it is currently only limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS are minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corruption data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the exam@@ ining process during an operation is higher and a defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 Bl@@ en@@ dencies of fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise character@@ ization for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of the 10 meg@@ api@@ ary sens@@ ors . even if this resolution is even too high for compact cameras and the end result is ideal for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel resolution . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk can be found today for 100 &amp; euro ; so make sure your data is affected by a data loss . therefore , make your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make something dangerous like the re@@ installing of your operating system , the exchange of disks , or the size of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . do planes exist : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or whole house .
hence , des@@ ast@@ er@@ ative fle@@ x@@ ion always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs into your neighbor , your office or something like that .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a more common reason for a data loss despite safegu@@ arding the panic . if you have a backup not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two points : one of the complete safegu@@ arding and the final differentiation .
in@@ cre@@ dible backup : a backup of files have been changed since the last backup . created several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time . this backup comes up with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system on the next with the exception that it has only been tagged and not continually running .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool you can easily setup your machines . in contrast to the script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer Scri@@ pts r@@ sync only the difference of files that really changed . this happens and if you want to increase security via ssh .
save important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer on a DVD or another op@@ tics medium .
this approach makes you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the end , you will come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment for at least one month and a moment you should manually happen after you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ invent@@ ing images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time period you really interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be respected :
as the future is un@@ fore@@ see@@ able because of nature , everything is said to be careful with caution and re @-@ rate during the time . unfortunately , there are no other possibility to get back@@ wards compatible . all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask oneself like the current system is backward . the less variants you have in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered with explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that &apos;s important to reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have installed the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . on * nix systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this range and put it on a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was recognized by the system , but do not hang them .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC &amp; dollars ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollars ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no more software you can read , then you can create it yourself . this task is simpler from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG is designed as an open source standard for GIF . but it is much more . it &apos;s loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , but not as many as T@@ IFF uses and a slow compression level . this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures .
T@@ IFF was widely used as picture format . T@@ IFF can store in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a low @-@ loss compression of compression ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . a problem is , however , that this format has been adapted to many people . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Negative file format is a license @-@ free and open rough aspect ratio , designed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the T@@ IFF / EP format and is required to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful cam@@ ore manufacturer , D@@ NG is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this is perhaps one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology has introduced to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block &amp; quot ; a mix of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic of XML and R@@ DF . the file information are stored in a file itself . the file information is stored for XML / R@@ DF ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers move it before an original of your recording , mostly in the rough format , where it stores the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . however , it can re@@ consider any problems with the link between the met@@ ad@@ at@@ ric file and the image file . therefore , you should consider if you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ at@@ enst@@ ards , which includes a large range of application purposes and modelling , discussions and collabor@@ ative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fying efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of met@@ ad@@ at@@ enst@@ ards and practices .
for example , import pictures from the camera , card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures are on the camera head , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save these in your Ro@@ re@@ chi@@ v . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a host@@ ile processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut under any circumstances from other programs .
protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , add in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; in paragraph adding a photos to an album , you &apos;ll find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import@@ ing photos to your Alb@@ end@@ ad@@ ata bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; connect these with the calcul@@ ator , turn the camera to the display mode , and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it is possible to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ fty indicator appears at the lower end and the capture pictures of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not show images for file association settings . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol indicates the file association for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information on each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of a updated or its met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information , which can be log@@ ged from the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer . note that with some digital cameras did not get all the information available .
the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer data , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; or the image processing . note that this met@@ ad@@ ata is not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button , and then download the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; . at downloading the photos are not deleted or we recommend you to verify that the pictures are secure in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the settings selected using the standard selection methods of &amp; K@@ DE . once you select the photos , select the button download and then select selected . the kno@@ b is selected until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is available now . these pictures have been downloaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate . in this case the new pictures have been selected with a star in front window . if you select this option , you will of course download the new pictures .
if you use buttons all download or selected files , select a dialogue with which you can select the target album . you can read the list of existing albums , like normal folder . select the list of folder on the list . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you select the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; downloads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all at once , simply delete the button free . if you just want to delete a few , you need to delete it first and delete the delete selected .
please note that there are no possibility of deleted photos that you deleted from the camera . therefore , the photos will not be checked in the tr@@ ash of &amp; K@@ DE ; they should be carefully checked , if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to complete the camera arith@@ me@@ tic , you should do this over the camera to make it faster .
cameras use as file names for the photos are often not particularly expres@@ sive names . this can be used again after the photos taken from the camera . this can be useful if you upload photos of different recording sets in the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and spe@@ ar of the image and date @-@ based underground . if you use this latter option , a file will be created automatically .
the options during the transfer opens three more options that will be performed before the photos stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF fields in the IP@@ TC @-@ field . with the latest option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish a different file format as the standard format , you can add the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . please add the option to the date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command .
if you use the camera file name , you will have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in case of capital letters if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , used &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name , which makes the camera available in preview . their settings will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; can use any information about the orientation of the camera for time recording , to perform an automatic rotation during the sign . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section of the page a met@@ ad@@ ata you can find more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not deliver these information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn off , use the button Advanced and select the automatic shift in the bottom of the window .
if your camera is made information about the date where the photo was made , can be used &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; these sub@@ albums are based on the image data . all images with the same date are loaded in the same script . not all cameras are available in the same script . in the section side@@ bar met@@ a @-@ data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this option , you will need to add this option and select the disk @-@ based sub@@ set at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from their hosts to your camera is the button download . then select File Transfer dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; you can select the file extensions that will be uploaded . you can also choose more than one file with the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you , where the images are to be loaded up . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select the desired file and press OK to start the upload . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as general term in this document . this is a position that can be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and that can be displayed on a map . the identification of data can be carried out by the American GPS , Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional phot@@ ograph@@ ers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place . not everyone uses an aircraft to carto@@ graph@@ s an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forget later , where exactly the photo was done , you can open a browser with a click to locate the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ f ; users want to locate the site of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is well to en@@ rich the position data of a photos .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the data into these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ working of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera which has integrated a GPS unit . but there is a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as card module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save those data in the GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the module to ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and width of lat@@ itude or other data , you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ if@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ defined coordinates to be created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com will show no European street types . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , all of the navigation details for Europe are showing .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tries to give you much control over his work processes as possible . there are lots of settings that have the behaviour of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; to select this settings , you need to set up on these settings . you can change between these settings , by clicking on the icons of the left side .
you can select a preview of clicking on the embedded preview or edit images . specify the standard behaviour of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; firm when click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation of standards and copyright data . these data will be automatically selected to the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields when the option to download from the camera interface . even when database synchron@@ isation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ oc@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for the editor : this field should contain the identification number of photographers . these can be names like e.g. arranged photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description on the car field , this must be filled also .
editor is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to work the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this is a photo agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here , then the group or agency will be available for the picture here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the appropriate IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ . this way , the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; this met@@ ad@@ ata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; imported without lost .
store images as embedded inscription ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments which you can also read with pictures embedded in pictures . attention : in pictures , which contain already labelling , they are over@@ written by the contents of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate .
the page settings contains all the options for information that will appear if the mouse po@@ inter is located in the main window over a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; di@@ gi@@ ate ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; preview , you can add the file extension to this list and remove any file in a &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; Alb@@ um@@ folders that has no such enlar@@ gements , ignored from &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset , by pressing the button Update on the right side of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; can be put on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; in the entire image size Lad@@ quot ; should you use only on fast computers . if you have one , then you can obtain a better result .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color you can select it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture . these colours are specified here . in picture editing , this screen mode can be switched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
the Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ ject is meant that images are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance and colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia to the higher explanation .
using the P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG is a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can add this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
using the T@@ IFF @-@ files option , you can adjust the De@@ fl@@ ate -@@ compression @-@ compression extension for T@@ IFF @-@ images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IFF @-@ images . it does not affect the image quality , as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorith@@ ms are loss @-@ free .
having los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you were able to lose the loss of loss , the relation between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate , picture @-@ working was only a photo @-@ viewer for photographs . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing .
the standard value is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option with odd lines in the output . if you use this option with a minimal loss of details . this option records this issue with a minimal loss of details . this option marks the image a little soft , eliminated but the 2x@@ 2 wi@@ z@@ pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white is not set off . standard is a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors , using the second sensors , this effect will get more details in four steps . for other cameras , this option will be ignored .
the standard is the top lights , so the parts of your images are in@@ different , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to catch a penet@@ rating white in the settings . in addition , you can solve some unusual results , since it shows the sp@@ ik@@ es in various ros@@ aries . last , you can attempt to recon@@ struct some of the missing information from the sh@@ lich@@ ter .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast filled as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red shares of the still un@@ filled blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how many color or white you want .
when you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and can be adapted for each image individually .
put the L@@ umin@@ ant value to your taste . you probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . but this may also be made later in the image options of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; to keep the time for the demo @-@ invo@@ icing , you should be conservative .
a demo application algorithm is a digital picture process to obtain a complete picture from the particle data that will come from the color filtered image sensor , which have many cameras and which are known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color @-@ construction .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; and D@@ ni@@ w provide you three alternatives to you : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it was created . however , it creates color action against the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the colour vari@@ ance of your lenses you can set the red and blue pro@@ o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a gra@@ ining correction because you will be carried out during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions like this again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; information about colour space over a colour space to translate the colors as precisely as possible .
behavior Questions , if an image in the image processing is opened / color administration module with raw files .
colour profile folders S@@ etting the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you store all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; exam@@ ines this folder during the start .
settings of the ICC profile you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can change when opening the raw file later .
the Color Gallery View is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here only your pictures are color @-@ managed not the whole screen .
the input profiles should be done to the camera plate and model you are using . not all profiles are produced on the same kind . there are some , such as Canon , which no color tone mapping or gam@@ ma@@ d@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ b gamma does not apply to conver@@ sions at 16 bits . this means that you must perform the tone mapping itself .
there are more options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your photo print from a device again . this is very useful before you print image , as your printer has a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated , rather than leaving the blind algorith@@ ms of your printer .
for most cameras it &apos;s quite obvious what colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not in the Canon &apos;s models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles to fit together . this answer is naturally un@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion can be seen in the style for the objective : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug @-@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; picture viewer and image processing is supported ; many modules support , which are written to cooperate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select which you want to use , and these are then loaded by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window and in addition , you will also see some of the cont@@ ex@@ tual menu pop@@ s .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu below Settings .
more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be accessed via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b is adjusted for the time between the outputs , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds is good . the other check@@ points turn the met@@ ad@@ ata a res@@ p , which appears at the lower end of the pictures during the display .
the camera features show on the left side a list of all available cameras . on the right side up there is a button Auto detection , which is trying to identify the camera properly , and make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image definition . currently , here are Seri@@ al , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass memory .
at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you have to set the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / pass , specify when you hang on your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you need to connect the camera with your computer to display them in the display mode .
try out whether &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set up camera model and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . these will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the confirmation dialog for the moving of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bank , you can adjust the Con@@ vers@@ atility of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; when del@@ eting a photos in an album , you will find further details in the del@@ eting of a photos and del@@ e@@ tion of an album .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be tac@@ itly with@@ held &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without feedback . otherwise , you must apply the changes with the button modifications .
they also can bind the ad @-@ screen umbre@@ llas of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; under sub@@ types , this acceler@@ ates the starting process of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; .

various color paintings can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you can adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can select under the settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be enum@@ er@@ ated below :
these designs have been defined in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; to create , you will find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; contains a quick image processing with some base tools . you can use these to view your photos and correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of a preview and menu entry .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of these are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; therefore , you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in the section image processing .
a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the file name , current date number , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size shows .
a menu bar at the upper edge , including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
editing functions of photo editing edit your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you use File Save or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have stored the image .
so you might need a copy of your image before you change it . you can save with file stores .
as long as you have not saved , you can restore the original image by using the menu file , restore the button to restore the image editing in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change that you have been performed on the photo since last store .
virtually every action of educational work can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can sort , by selecting editing and re @-@ manufactured using editing from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should do the key abbrevi@@ ation , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z for the back and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ change @-@ Z to re@@ produce .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a cont@@ ex@@ tual menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all the actions between also re@@ processed and restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same head@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool bar , image high , image down or the entries in the menu file . if you have any changes on the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter in the photo and zoom out in that you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the An@@ si@@ chts menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : enlargement factor automatically
view Full screen view shows the photo in full screen mode . you will normally be able to change the tool@@ bar . normally , if you do not wish to change this on the installation dialog by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; then you can call this from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; watch this section to set the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print it in the menu file and get the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; press dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print single pictures or whole sentences . entire image pages can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the images with the standard methods and from the menu album Export device . if you follow the wi@@ z@@ ard you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which is available to important information and actions for selected pictures , also available in picture processing . it will be displayed if one of the five riders are cli@@ cked :
multiple @-@ click on the same rider will appear or disappear again in the rim .
in the labelling view , you can insert labels with unlimited size or insert . note the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields that you can use by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut down and special characters are formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC @-@ labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you comments on , use either the button application or change simply for the next image , the inscri@@ ptions are then stored .
in addition to the applic@@ tion button , there is a button more . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also put the met@@ ad@@ ata to the files . however , this is always done when you select a met@@ ad@@ ata settings that are always written in the pictures .
the section evaluation shows a score rating of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the top bar or with the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the evaluation from the side@@ bar is always used to evaluate more pictures at the same time , select this context and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key view shows a search box for fil@@ tering the keywords , the sample @-@ tree and a selection box with the previously in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; session fixed stit@@ ch .
the keyword is dynam@@ ically adapted to the given search phr@@ ase . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities by searching for a by@@ word . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief when typ@@ ing the sample at a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , these settings will be saved for fast access .
keyword can also be set by marking the respective check boxes in the tree . all keywords : image files are stored in the IP@@ TC field .
if multiple images are selected in the main view , select a keyword in the sample @-@ tree , this only will be applied to the up@@ scale image and not on the entire selection , if you want to choose a selection with a keyword , please read the section keyword filter .
the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the main window displayed . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and addic@@ ts . if additionally , one or more sample filters from the right side will be used , only the chi@@ ves of these two are displayed . all set keywords are available .
you can also drag and lay down . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view , you can easily drag them out of the right side bar and put it on the selection . as a result , a dialog appears that you want to set the keyword .
in the top example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the sample filter is selected on no keywords . they were drawn with C@@ tr@@ l + a and afterwards the keyword sub@@ stit@@ uted from the right head tree to the selection and put it off . a dialog asks whether this keyword is supposed to be set .
these search for changes takes place in any start of the program . you can also be switched on the settings .
if you have a rule with and you have created and realize that it should be or should be a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry to be found in the database . this may be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can define a Advanced search over all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button . the options then look like this :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the pictures in the full resolution .
this article / tut@@ orial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve mainly used &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate and adjusted for concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a colour @-@ administered workflow is the colors that of your camera or scanner can reach a predic@@ table variations of which in fact you can print out the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner at the same time that you print or publish the colors back from your digital dark@@ room .
if the subject is on color administration , everybody wants to know which buttons it is necessary for the results that he wants . unfortunately , this tut@@ orial will give you sufficient background information about colour Administration . additionally , you should make links with deeper information enabling you to obtain your own informed decisions to make you the desired result .
if your image workflow is fulfilled every six below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about colour administration .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB @-@ colour gam@@ ut . ( further information click below )
your only other photo editions are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and make life for all so simple , why should one use another colour space and thus would you have to worry about color p@@ aci@@ f@@ ng ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ x @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour space , so please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excellent site and then click on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB color space ?
yes ! if you are working in the RGB @-@ color space or not , you &apos;ll need to calibr@@ ate your monitor , since it &apos;s RGB of your monitor . if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , then you must either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB @-@ standard , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions giving one image in most cases . therefore , use it before attemp@@ ting to try a further manual processing .
the features norm@@ alize , ab@@ stain@@ ed , automation and contrast exp@@ ires from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ t automatic correction automatically try to make the best of your colours . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see which works best on your photo .
norm@@ alize the leu@@ ka@@ emia values above the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as light as possible without its color sha@@ dy . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
compar@@ ing : this method uses the illumin@@ ant factor in the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity can be used as flat as possible . sometimes , the result is very good results in improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it is also only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracle with a painting or destroyed it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the rot@@ - , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust the rot@@ - , green and blue channels on the entire history of history .
contrast Incre@@ ased : this method improves the contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of a picture through the post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest values on the maximum possible range and a new ji@@ bs of all values in between . this is only visible at balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the bald @-@ slip of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white waste of a photos .
the white @-@ equal correction is somewhat limited because of an colour space with 8 @-@ bit color space . if you can also be too far from the original picture , areas with over@@ flow occur . if you are working the white like in the mode , your possibilities will be better to correction .
this tool is based on a white bal@@ ancing extension of the copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it via the menu entry to the white picture of the picture processing .
the front window can be adjusted in size . on the left , the original image can be seen as well . the preview can be dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whit@@ ish like , then click on the window .
the preview of the target photos has a red markers . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pi@@ p@@ ics under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right above , a hist@@ ogram is indicated that once you have changed a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three sha@@ des or your sum will be displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on sha@@ dows , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow Adjust@@ ment allows you to improve or di@@ mming the sha@@ dows of your photos .
starting with the af@@ ore@@ mentioned checks , you should use the colour temperature @-@ pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and after that you can use the color temperature to calculate the color temperature of the white monitor . this type will also set the temperature and Green Val@@ ues .
additionally you can set the white off with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ load indicator will increase the colors , if more than a colour channel of the Pi@@ pe is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in the white balance . this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and load do exactly this . each setting of the white compar@@ isons you have set can be saved in a text file and re@@ load later .
the Button default settings uses all the filter values back to their standard values and the respective neutral white compar@@ isons . note that even neutral settings will be given another photo than your original . if you store them , your original image will be changed .
you can set here the deco@@ ding depth per colour channel of the processed picture . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . this coding also requires more turn@@ tables , computing time and also stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialogue as the editing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color tone mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the hel@@ lig@@ aments . a detailed manual for the use of color profiles can be taken to rate .
another important tool is available in the menu under color ton@@ ic correction . this tool presents an integrated way to adjust the same mistakes and allow you to use them for several photos . this is useful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistakes and you always need the same correction . in the manual for ton@@ ing correction you will find further information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to gra@@ dation , that you will find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool color effects provides you four colour effects , a solar effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ line filter .
in times of the chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was created an effect when using a partial flash light and subsequently inver@@ ted the development of the image . this had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas were inver@@ ted from the second lighting . this result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar thermal system . in approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows the picture which is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is made , finally a negative picture is that not to produce Fot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the revised intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filters sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easily , he emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an illustrated color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot , and therefore a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as powerful colors are also made by some phot@@ ograph@@ ers , especially those who have little landscapes , too much .
the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on light to the contrast edges . the parameter Levels controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repet@@ itions the strength of the ne@@ on . in big pictures the filter can equi@@ p the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual you want to fix the color con@@ tra and the brightness of the photos . all your settings can be seen in the preview . once you are satisfied with the score , use the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you have a photo of poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can be able to increase it instead . all changes you can carry out in the preview if you like the result you can confirm the changes with oo@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ k@@ starch / contrast / Gamma , the tool reads sound value correction for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog to this tool appears very complicated , you only need the area of sli@@ der . more concrete the three sli@@ der below the history program .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the inside and to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the operation is to post@@ p@@ one the kno@@ b and make sure how the image changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview can be dynamic , updated on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis is displayed . in pictures the large areas of a constant color is dominated by the linear hist@@ ogram of a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ ier .
the three colour pin@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image , in order to adjust the input of the sha@@ dows , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers enable the output values to inter@@ actively with the input values . the compression of output values can be used , for example , to create a diversi@@ fied image as background to create while something else is fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button , images are automatically set in dependence on the values of the image .
save as and store : with these buttons , the set values are stored in the file system and later re@@ loaded . the Gim@@ p level is used .
if you are using this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input will automatically re @-@ adjusted for all sha@@ dows , means and sun@@ tones . please click the preview of the original image to set the input of the hist@@ ogram for rotation , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over@@ load device controls all color channels to indicate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . here it is a indicator , i.e. you will get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect to see the final result .
below you can see an example of the adjustments of inputs applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview can be dynam@@ ically updated on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
Modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere Channel : this box box allows the channel to indicate the channel changed by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode allows the log@@ arith@@ mic mode .
if you move an arrow to the right , for example , the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright tones are corresponding with dark expressions and that are corresponding to the corresponding picture @-@ pixel dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the curve that will change the original value , create a point on this line and move it on and off , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve can be created with this file system and later can be loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you create this method and the three d@@ pi@@ p@@ ettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette to use you and click on the original picture to put control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ load device controls all color channels to indicate over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel superior pixels , you get the combined result . here it is a indicator , i.e. you will get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white picture which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ duct . shadow and te@@ ens was applied using the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the correct ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; image processing is a tool to improve the channel channels , or change the sha@@ dows of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix colour sha@@ des of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of the image processing .
you can select the colour for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window displays you a preview of . the original can be considered as a comparison of your own rider .
the preview of the target picture features a red markers . if you positioning this in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the appropriate color value .
the controls for the module are right down : control for red , green and construction allow you to adjust this channels even if you also activate the respective color component . this is particularly convenient if you are also using mon@@ ochro@@ me , since the channel mixer is then used to generate great black @-@ and conver@@ sions of your photo . try the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a colour is to a visible roug@@ h@@ um which occur naturally in colour channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the far@@ my@@ ths first .
the Save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any mixer @-@ setting can be saved to later and download . that used file format is the Gim@@ p @-@ mixer format .
the option over@@ load device controls all color channels to indicate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . here it is a indicator , i.e. you will get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the painted picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction ability . with the development of digital photography , black / white one step , since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scenarios and fits especially well @-@ portraits in the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lin@@ ter filter . this improves landscape , maritime scenes and air photos . thus similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Orange film .
rot@@ ational : sim@@ ulates a black / white film illumination with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ est@@ effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar @-@ fruits to the day of the day . so similar to the 003 of C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ ary .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural shade of paint and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium touches while offering a little cold in the sha@@ des . this is very similar to the process of a pressure and re@@ development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ ons . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether there is a color picture or not , you can look like a painting in an ancient master , a pop Art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu input image texture and image processing can be used .
relief : move this parameter to the right raises the illumination of the depth or three dimensional texture on the picture .
a paper text sample is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and changing under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool frames can add a decorative frame to be added to an image .
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos is not easy task . to keep its attention , it is a psychological barrier to keep an eye frame . this is a psychological barrier to the scatter@@ ing eye . under image frame , the module can be started using the image processing .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . en@@ cir@@ cled with a thin line and a broad frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , it rot@@ ates with a nice three @-@ dimensional setting , ideal for a button effect and decor@@ atively add a decorative frame with pattern .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
this with the frame has been bigger than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important to print the pictures , especially if you use the tool according to aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple a form@@ at@@ ted text in a picture to any place . this also goes on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text , and place it with the mouse . use text surface , orientation , colour from colour space and character set with its properties . the larger the image , the larger needs to be the character set . to conclude , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any attitude you have chosen for your text can be changed until you select &apos; OK &quot; button . after the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed .
use the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; use tool sten@@ cil to place a template on an image .
the menu Picture Tem@@ plates can be used in picture editing , to place templates for a picture .
for the template there is no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and to add with maximum compres@@ sing ( 9 ) to remove the template &apos;s size of the template . if you have to add your template in English to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; mailing list di@@ gi@@ f @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you &apos;ll need to set your template file with the button base folder inside the dialog . select the folder you can copy the template . these settings will be registered for the next start .
after the root folder was set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template . the selection of a folder will automatically update the template &apos;s template .
below the preview , there are three buttons on which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button makes the underlying picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inking : this button resi@@ zed the underlying picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of mouse . if you want to use the template on the whole image , you need to shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
shift : use this button to move the form below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template on your image . the picture will then be adjusted automatically .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; three different tools are available for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and simple , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny p@@ ics .
Un@@ sharp@@ ened mask works on the contrast of edges to make a sharp picture . actually it &apos;s not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and he is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Chang .
the focus is probably the best of the three , since it truly improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is why sharp edges are printed with only minimal differences to a colour point . this in turn indicates that sharp edges are printed on paper . SLR cameras will normally require more thou@@ ght@@ ful sharp@@ ening as normal cameras for the private user .
at JPEG image , an internal sharp@@ ness of internal sharp@@ ening has been applied . images in the raw format should always be tigh@@ tened in during processing .
some scanners spend a sharp@@ ening filter during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this dis@@ able , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful outcomes by sharp@@ ening a photo of sharp@@ ening sharp@@ ening . this allows you to navigate with the menu entry .
but they should deal carefully , since the results are not very natural : sharp@@ ening the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you can find it on the menu input Kor@@ rig@@ or Re@@ focus . under Re@@ focus , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too tight . the solution , the image is a bit soft to draw . use the tool to make the soft@@ ness with the menu input Kor@@ rig@@ gle , and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter is sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove veil@@ s from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help edit the picture . the window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius , or amount increases the effect . if you make the sharp@@ ening mask too strongly , smoke and generate the impression of gr@@ ates near sharp edges .
the radius will introduce a number of pixels on each side of an edge by the filter . high @-@ resolution pictures allow larger channels . so you should make images best in their final resolution .
the amount is added to the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red picture that is added to the original . thereby , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the corpor@@ al value is a fraction of the maximum RGB values and the necessary differential amount . it is possible to define a minimal difference in this way for the edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change occurs between the tones of sharp@@ ening and therefore cosmetic errors can be avoided in faces , heavens and water surface areas .
this is an example of the un@@ usually m@@ asked filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture the ( 2 ) . im@@ properly m@@ asked with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool Re@@ foc@@ usses , focuses on an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright infr@@ a @-@ protected ab@@ using filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to make a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ en@@ quot ; it is used to focus a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ening images is usually better results than in@@ sharp m@@ asked . you can start from the menu by setting colors re@@ focus within the image processing .
in practice the circular she@@ ath works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ el . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ ill has a very long tail , which is far from the original tor@@ ches , which is widely influenced by the original tor@@ ches . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ ill is influenced in most cases even very strongly from distant pixels . it causes un@@ wanted outcomes .
circular support : this is the radius of circular switching . it is the most important parameter for use this module . for most pictures the default value should result in 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very in@@ sharp , but then pay attention to Heiligen@@ vou@@ chers .
Cor@@ relation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce Ar@@ te@@ facts . correlation coefficient can be found in 0.5 and values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced to the sharp@@ ening effect of the module .
Cater@@ pillar filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce Ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 is the image quality very bad . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will continue the image further .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , use these values to avoid un@@ sharp@@ ened filter . in most cases , if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation between the correlation and / or the rocket filter .
match @-@ size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ ry can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular support or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any Re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing parameters will be placed on that you will then be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before you use the module .
otherwise , you should use the module , before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible , but then leave un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read pictures and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module onto the un@@ compressed image .
generally , it produces in@@ sharp m@@ asked better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by a sharp m@@ asked for a bigger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ tically it must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never allow the effect of def@@ use . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters you can never point out the effect of the F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ters always at least as good as the sharp@@ est mask . the F@@ IR Vienna Filter is often better in processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between different fil@@ tering , on a small , focused picture :
the original un@@ clear colour picture must be corrected . this picture has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed result is attributable to un@@ sufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information about the methods of sharp@@ ening improvement in digital images , you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address .
the kno@@ b controller sets the sharp@@ est of the area p@@ orted to generate a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ te allows a customized color for pupils . in case you want to adjust blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the image error correction is one of the bro@@ ther@@ to developed tool to remove non @-@ required arti@@ facts .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AG@@ E Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different default settings as a starting point to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available settings are listed below :
in case you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab and Advanced Settings &quot; tab .
detail work p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of details . a smaller value leads to a consistent gl@@ itter@@ ing over the image . a value of 0.9 should be so preserved , so that no sharp@@ ening is necessary . please note that the details of the convention is always under@@ lined .
code depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes equally in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you create a film grain or CCD space , JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts will be best eliminated at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum effect factor via all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , put this value as a level of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is subject to greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to generate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually , 1 or 2 is usually enough .
angle gradu@@ al da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small . be sure that small angle should be a long run@@ time . you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step @-@ length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step within pixels . you should set the value less than 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never greater than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More on quality you can get through di@@ alling this option is only low . he doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it .
the buttons save as and load do exactly this . each setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and later will be loaded again .
picture error is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last but still last long and a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button demol@@ ition .
below , you can see how image errors can be removed with small art@@ e@@ facts . the module is used on a photograph that in Guatemala City has been used with an analogue camera . as you see , there is a unique black arti@@ fact in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey , the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate came ; cat@@ tery reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter H@@ he@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , for example , from dust or hair on lin@@ se . it can also be used to remove sensor people from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned pictures from books or magazines .
if you need further information on micro@@ cameras for digital cameras , you can read these in the tut@@ orial in English .
the screen photo shows a typical scene with a digital camera and an high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny wall that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the lower advanced settings can remain in the default settings .
radius controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values increase the time by the filter per pixel and allows the image administered by the radius and the color in it is smoo@@ th@@ ed and thus smaller bugs are adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel pitch to determine the filter forward . if it is raised , noise tips will be adjusted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details may not get more and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls the edge of the filter for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the frequency response is not possible or any noise tips can occur . if you want to remove a weak or JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to enhance a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to change an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process which is controlled by the details settings .
gamma : controls the G@@ amm@@ ate tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark zones , which are typically stronger , however , the shadow zones .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase damp@@ ing . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter response to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , noise and phase gl@@ itter can appear on the edges . he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this .
save under and store : these buttons are used for this . all parameters for space reduction that you have set can be stored in the file system and later is loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your lives . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) and the random reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture too cute for your purpose . the solution , the image is a bit soft to draw , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen with the menu input Kor@@ rig@@ gle and experiment with the Gl@@ ance . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; photo Rest@@ art is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo presentations .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts of your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sors and local errors . the smoo@@ thing is performed along the image con@@ tours and thereby receives the content as it does the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ turing . the tex@@ tual replacement is developed with another tool , the image error correction , developed by the IM@@ AG@@ E team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ die and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas it is even very far away . as a loss of los@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ e@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are shown in un@@ compressed image . this attitude should correct this problem .
the buttons save as and load do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can her@@ eby be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo Rest@@ oration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last but still last long and a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below , you can reduce how a photo of a formal noise is being restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO was used . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct one below ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo that has been created with a scanner . you can see the scan @-@ arti@@ facts produced by the scan lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot @-@ pixel photos that were used with a CCD camera gem , eight were to remove . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ stop .
light , t@@ ote or hot pixels are especially important in high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression of hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pi@@ v@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark sub@@ tra@@ cting method . there is currently no manual method to choose the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will recognize automatic hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to take you to discover the dark image directly by using new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the correct image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note here that the wi@@ z@@ ard will notice the last dark and automatically ref@@ resh this in the next meeting .
the image range and the preview help you correct within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all examples areas .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate this pixel size . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ inc@@ ision : an average of the adjacent pixel size is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel block is drawn up to calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear bends ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in block .
square : this is the default method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less for pixel block is approached to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel &apos;s pixel .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less can be approached to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic bends ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction is a tool to correct the v@@ int@@ ment , i.e. under@@ going corners , a image .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often do the entire sensor range . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ nic@@ ig@@ en@@ quot ; ( sha@@ dows ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that sensor there . Tele@@ promp@@ ted show this behavior too .
however , it has dis@@ advantages . many center filter need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the Bl@@ ending filter , which should be impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lens should also be used , also with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ sharp@@ est effects caused by movement .
with the great exposure of modern filters and film scanner , it is also possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by an equivalent transformation in a base that has been made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright from John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vig@@ net@@ tic correction filter and with three further exposure of the target picture .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light signals at the point of the largest density of the filter . the default density is 2.0 , which means an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or randomly to compens@@ ate the density of a greater degree of vig@@ or reducing it to compens@@ ate it for a small degree .
Leu@@ k@@ starch , Con@@ tr@@ ast and Gamma Settings : the editing of a picture reduces the lumin@@ ance of the pixels . you must adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options , as you need to increase your settings , as you need to increase the settings .
if you want a more sensitive re@@ positioning of the target picture , let the values for lumin@@ ous / contrast / gamma at zero and use gra@@ dation from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate device ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction in an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the v@@ ign@@ ant in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a cereb@@ ral and contrast correction was also performed on the image with this tool .
die &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; Lin@@ ear dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion . color@@ less dist@@ ortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree handles the overall geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or conv@@ ex form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fla@@ w@@ ls off the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the coefficient fourth degree is corrected to the distant corners of the second degree . if you combine these two geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion , virtually eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of second order . using negative values can be corrected , dist@@ ortion @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of the order . this value is stronger than the edges as in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has the inver@@ ted pre@@ mark of the General .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and leads through a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while reducing the image .
brigh@@ ten : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview the dist@@ ortion correction . the values that you use for your image will be stored and used as standard values .
the V or cus@@ hion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting @-@ or size changes . best , you perform this correction as all the first . if you are cutting a picture new and later a mut@@ ually @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of the wrong way .
to help you find the best correction for you , this tool gives you vertical and horizontal line line . do you move it to an important place , such as the seaside town or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button in order to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the / / ho@@ ver@@ ular dist@@ ortion with the help of lines .
if you &apos;re a ho@@ ver@@ ular dist@@ ortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can cut them with the cutting tool in the menu , cutting them from the image processing or via the zoom controller .
for most pictures , the user @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from the front , frames and paintings , it is the perspective to correct the every angle in the image 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand , you always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective .
this is an example of the ann@@ ular correction being applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infr@@ a @-@ red , the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left of the window you can select the range for a preview . if you shift the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can adjust two parameters , adjust the gra@@ iny and film sensitivity ( ISO ) if you want to sim@@ ulate the grain texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and domin@@ ance of the colour green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in converting . green meadows are white like snow !
since filter channels to re@@ produce infr@@ a @-@ red film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour settings are missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red filter printed on a Land@@ scape Photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) and the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO levels create a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; Filter Film Agency is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film grain on your pictures . this is known from classic @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to enhance the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer has large silver grain of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere released from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ ft view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter .
with the controllers , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film producer to a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the working ( 2 ) , which was used as a film sensitivity to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; Filter Oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; Filter Oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance , like an oil painting . nature images and styles are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the pin size between one and five . th@@ icker thick@@ nesses are better for large images . smoo@@ thing the gl@@ ands or , from the other side of view , the char@@ ities .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and which is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and Gl@@ ance 17 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients for creating a coal deposit . therefore , images of their gra@@ dients are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene they would have chosen to sk@@ etch out . these are good pictures to begin with it .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator cho@@ oses the pin size and the bottom adjust the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result may be further improved by adjust@@ ing the intensity value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter engraving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped on wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your pictures with a simple structure , in which color does not use the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ astic landscape .
depth allows to set the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engra@@ ver filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) , which used a depth of 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using dist@@ ortion effect . it is used to copyright protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image in the cells , and it can look like if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need long time for calculation and generate a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using non@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses the copyright @-@ protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom in@@ def@@ y : wi@@ ping the picture along the circular lines that go out of a center . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ening a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al im@@ sharp@@ est : wi@@ ped the picture by rotation of the pixels around a centre . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a rot@@ ting camera .
distances : wi@@ pes the picture to create a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to re@@ sign back in the background .
movement of motion : wi@@ pes the image by horizontal movement of the pixel . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photography , camera .
delicate un@@ sharp@@ est : wi@@ pes the image soft in the dark and strong in bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or to add a warm and subtle g@@ low .
cont@@ amin@@ ant : wi@@ pes the image by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a mot@@ ion@@ less moving camera .
intelligent un@@ sharp@@ est : find the colour tank in the picture and fry them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells , and then it is created by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ets are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image . this gives them natural pictures a great appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm .
dri@@ p size does not allow the size of dri@@ ps to change . since the drop @-@ size does not grow automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . amount changes the amount of drops . f@@ ish@@ ops changes the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can keep using &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; editing a section of free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that will remain freely . if you leave the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ack , the range will remain blank by rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ack &apos;s filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ r@@ oring or turning into the right orientation . the tools for this purpose you will find trans@@ forming or transformation s@@ ke@@ wers .
photo infl@@ ated is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to increase a photo in a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you wake up a picture and get the details sharp ? how can you find out the missing information or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the size of size . select trans@@ forming size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool for size will use a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to ampli@@ fy the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for blowing up .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IM@@ AG@@ E team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to say to the tool , as you want to change size . these settings are available in the rider , New size and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the input of the new size is retained for the aspect ratio of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is subject to greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to generate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect .
buttons as and load will be used exactly . each deposit for photo can enlarge as text file saved and later re@@ loaded .
photo infl@@ ated is very fast with what it does , but it can still last a long time and a high CPU load after you . you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see an example of photo infl@@ ating , by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the forecast ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard aug@@ mentation .
the cutting of a photo is not just a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture with the mouse simply just the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle , create this rectangle then while you move the mouse .
if you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . as a result , you can change the size of the area to a cutting area by going to the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle create you by clicking on the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting @-@ section , use the button The Zu@@ ill button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries to store or file Save as in the menu to save the re @-@ cut photo .
in the fore@@ seen area , you can change the size of the rectangle by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you defined in the dialogue remains .
after aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a single @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the file format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format is assigned .
the tool indicates aspect ratio and uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal to whether you may be centi@@ meters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you may see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to be selected horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below , you can set the Max . relationship button for cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool sets out aspect ratio ( horizontal or vertical ) , depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) , these settings are stored as standard values in dependence on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data are mir@@ ro@@ red and not the original picture .
the settings of contra@@ cting assistance enable help to capture them , so that you can create your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ rule , harmon@@ ious triangles is a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ious triangles at the diagonal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division of a different natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus mus@@ sels or the pet@@ als of a sun flower . it emerg@@ es in all possible things that we find as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already with the old Egyptians and Greeks who designed the temple and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you joined your pictures , buildings and even photos related to your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , etc . , where every number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two numbers in the middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmon@@ ious .
the golden @-@ centre provides liquid aid lines , if you have an image . these assist will be enum@@ er@@ ated below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos to get closer . compared to third @-@ thirds the golden spiral line of the eye can follow through the picture . this kind of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow on this type .
another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should give something that the eye can be in the center of composition . this can be a line of its or different objects . this something can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the golden triangles are also top@@ pled from the top . its failure are the center of sides of the golden rectangle . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to this lines can place a static object .
when you use golden triangles use your frame around your frame , you will create a effect from a professional photographer dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try to place your photo focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t reach differently .
the options Horizont@@ al mir@@ ro@@ red and vertical mirror can be used to reflect harmon@@ ious particles .
with the button color , you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the support lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the colour of lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easy to adjust the camera not exactly vertically and horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where things are turned around an angle . you can repair this with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; image editing and tool @-@ free rotation . choose Trans@@ forming the free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide is set in degrees . by default pres@@ ets you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will appear on the right above .
for your help , the module contains a horizontal and vertical line at your disposal . move the mouse po@@ inter to position the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the image , you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after turning a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is the function of transformation from the picture processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the automatic function automatic . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option sets the picture a bit after rotation . but note the above warning .
all per@@ cent@@ ric trans@@ formations are performed at a fixed point in the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you have to use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview can then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which you can help to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty sections created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty sections created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees towards the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees near the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees near the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjust@@ ing the perspective , the image becomes a little added . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adap@@ t@@ ations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have attached the perspective , you can easily cut three angular holes on the corners . if you want to clean this , it is the picture with transformer cutting from the picture processing .
the switching tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part to the opposite . this is no rotation , the picture is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rectangle will be transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can restart this module over transformation .
make your picture by using the Horizont@@ al angle and vertical angles . if you press on pres@@ ets , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of Eff@@ ective will display you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed right from the fore@@ see .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button in order to adjust the lines to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the draw , the picture will be a bit wi@@ red . for a single layer of this effect , this effect is usually negle@@ cted , but two notes are given twice as much as in@@ corrup@@ tible and therefore you should avoid this .
after shifting , the picture has a beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an option to eliminate it is the picture with transformer cutting from the picture processing .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the formats are therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the type like this libraries comp@@ ile , you will be able to edit a large number of pictures with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate .
because of this ad@@ diction of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system , but you will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF underneath .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; only shows files in formats that know . this is done in file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can edit this list of file extensions for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; in the section configuration you will find more information about this .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats you can find in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression technique on digital images . in this way , redund@@ ant information is reduced , in order to save the image data onto a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 also supports , in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results as JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also be able to save if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the shell format , you can read about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge used in colour very useful guides in English . you can download raw size images in JPEG or T@@ IFF with the raw image converter from &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; in the following configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; supports the store of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; included . with this , you can see more than 200 raw file formats . all of them can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of commodities which came from &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; supported by :
many digital cameras are supporting the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . if you click on a film file , it is not a film editing program and therefore , if you click on a film file &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings to play movies use to play the program to play .

if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast is already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the bald module .
many tools which you need for photo editing are in &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; included . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , so@@ iling , r@@ ins@@ ing , re@@ focus , in@@ sharp m@@ asked , &amp; etc ; use a standardized dialog type before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applic@@ ated quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of filter to the current picture . to the left of him , five buttons allow the compar@@ ative mode of the fore@@ see@@ able area . these modes are :
vertical divide without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected presentation .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected pre@@ views .
vertical divide . the left area shows the original and the right for comparison the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original , and the lower part of the filter &apos;s effect .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the fore@@ ground and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can be able to display over@@ load and lower cle@@ aring . the colors used in general can be adapted .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can remove this framework by mouse inside the picture and look at the part of the picture , from which you want to look ahead . the preview of the dialog starts immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left @-@ hand corner , here is a help and the possibility to res@@ p all buttons on your default values . all inser@@ ts from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar properties shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained , it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the important parameters in shooting of the photos . these data are derived from the EX@@ IF data if they are available .
this tab displays an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button in order to move a square . all images inside this coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this is prec@@ eded by your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit is an editor for pall@@ ets files . application can be used to edit colour pal@@ let and to select and use colors of colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; K@@ DE ; can either be installed for the entire system or just one user . in the latter case they are in your personal file for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined colors and last used colours .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or bro@@ wse the files by files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the palm view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the color next to it . the color is described below the tabl@@ ature preview . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to choose . in order to create such a selection , click the area next to a colour to move the cur@@ sor there . afterwards , you move the mouse on pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m cur@@ sor is inserted under the button color , the color will be inserted either or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode is selected or over@@ write . this mode allows you to select the check box over@@ write under Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection , which is created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting , and insert .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a c@@ eil@@ ing sign , followed by a line character in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; included .
the colors in the pal@@ let and the output of colour selection can be pulled with the mouse .
you can choose a color somewhere on the screen and then select the color chosen on the left .
&amp; graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE programme for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Dresses . graph@@ s . graph@@ s are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , particularly in Computer Science . so far there was not a modern &amp; GUI program , which includes graph@@ s and X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program .

menu to open the Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; open or graph@@ ed the graph in &amp; co@@ graph ; in a &amp; Kate ; component to open
loaded from large graph ( currently there are problems of about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than this no@@ des )
other required software : &amp; graph viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program that requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of graph@@ s required . needed in detail :
the main window shows the opened graph@@ s , each in its own window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom image file . in this case the tool bar contains only the icon file and open the ( empty ) List Last updated files . Click on the first icon to display the dialog file .
after selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom image photo :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the character space . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
the zo@@ oming in both directions is limited by a factor of 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just changed in &amp; co@@ graph ; uploaded file from another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; graph viewer ; can also realize your choice , so that later , you can change your decision later , you can set the menu icon Settings ... use , see also .
if you open a graph out outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graph ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; -@@ instance to open or want to display the lad@@ ders in a sub@@ window of the ongoing instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also changes with setup dialog .
with the program launch , you can open all graph@@ s of your last meeting again . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also define how the graph is to be split to multiple sites . the number of horizontal and vertical pages may be freely chosen .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which are to be entered into one page , will be entered into this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not appear in the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several sites distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
once again , load uses the possibility to determine behavior when a file has changed on the hard disk , eg . from another program . you can set a default setting ( automatically re@@ load or to ignore the changes ) or program each time .
the site is open to determine the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; determine if a graph is open outside of a current session . you can open a default behavior for this case ( the graph@@ s in a new window or in a lower window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the page seating force gives the possibility to determine the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; determine a standard behaviour ( the files of the last session open or not ) or determine if you are asked to get asked .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic location allows GPS coordinates to display in the met@@ ad@@ ata of a picture and edit the geographical data stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ sample of the image and loc@@ alization may be displayed in an external browser card .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization is available to loc@@ alize pictures geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system that is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itud@@ inal and width of lat@@ itude is used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ st@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call up the menu . in order to un@@ load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to upload a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains the rest of the same time at the same locations , as pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded , a automatic correlation is performed in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera system must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . Click here your camera zone .
setting for the maximum time deviation is a top deviation for GPS time and camera capacity . if the deviation is carried out , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds is then cor@@ related to all images in this field .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you do not have any matching data . if you know that in reality , you can set a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can cor@@ relate these limits and then cor@@ relate to the button .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialogue . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . as the dialog can use the coordinates from a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed area and can be set . select the relevant region and get it again through until you have a sufficient accuracy . the amount must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that ex@@ if@@ tool uses to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported to HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is encoded UTF @-@ 8 to enable a possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders where the settings can be adapted to the settings . the semen selection does not select all albums . you will need to select these albums , with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area , the Al@@ ask@@ preview and the text which will appear in the head of the HTML page will appear .
the tab has defined the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is created largely self . if you click on a picture you &apos;ll click on a new page in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will display directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ Show , displayed
the rider album defined the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything will be created there .
if you select the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , the influences can also be explained by all other settings .
the tab displays you some of the settings from the album Reiter for the he@@ als , these are small images that are displayed in the Gallery .
a progress window displays the user to how far the action is . press ab@@ ort out to break the process .
if the module creates the pages , the window is not automatically closed . therefore , you can read the program reviews in order to see if errors have occurred during creation . the web browser is automatically launched to preview the preview list .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows to view a selection of pictures and implement basic operations like fil@@ ming , zo@@ oming or sc@@ oring . the viewer can use short commands and M@@ aus@@ sten . it has been developed for quick image display and rapid access to its functions .
after start a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module permits to store images in JPEG format , without the usual losses on quality or met@@ ad@@ ata .
the consequence of the loss of loss is that the file size increases , as no compres@@ sing of the colour information is taking place . for example , there is also again the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool that you can connect to your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ .@@ or@@ . attention : the participants of this list speak English .

with the import -@@ function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module you can copy data from one image to another . then select the import function and then call the import function , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied by clicking on the button OK .
this function doesn &apos;t work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please look ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in a slide show .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected pictures to a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . between the single pictures you can add a basic screen size . you can also add a audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide .
all pictures will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can create a background colour for the slide . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . you may also use the K@@ 3@@ b program for burning the media .
first you need to select the pictures which will be packed into the MPEG Di@@ as@@ au . then you can start the module with ex@@ tras m@@ asch@@ au .
these selected pictures are then listed below image files . there you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning to select the file on a TV , you must default the respective TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture . the speed of the picture is specified among them . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth white @-@ shift .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should set it black . you can determine the name and path of the generated file . keep your name mp@@ g if possible .
if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the film . after all settings you have adapted your wishes . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go quickly or in all the rest you enjoy a coffee , if you are back again .
if a note appears that co@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right below .
print assist@@ ent allows to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined pictures can be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is , for example , make sense to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import / convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that there is the same results , like the software from your camera writer . sometimes you get better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file that will be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . by the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further process the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains equal and only the extension is accordingly adapted . JPEG uses a low @-@ loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged Image format , T@@ IFF , keeps all the information of your picture and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compres@@ sing .
if you pre @-@ edit your images often or later you should not use the JPEG format , as it allows only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata that contain in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF file .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use ab@@ ort .
the stack @-@ processing mode allows you to convert various images to once . if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single pictures . however , you have the possibility to automatically re@@ write it automatically . however , this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier test . however , the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all the pictures in an album . it uses the image from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several pictures of an image collection . it uses the image size from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can add the image size or enlarge . in addition , four types of the image change can be provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the picture will be automatically chosen , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : the change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your image to screen size .
proportional : proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
printing preparations : preparing the image for photo printing . the user can adjust pressure up and size of phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background colour , is adapted accordingly .
using this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send chosen images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures before . further pictures can draw on the list of the pictures .
after you started the module , the pictures window with the selected pictures will be displayed . you can add more pictures from your selected images . you can add more pictures to the selected image . for the last modified image , a preview of the picture will be displayed .
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and place it down to add the list of the pictures .
with the button images , remove the selected pictures from the list of chann@@ eling images .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients with the button OK . you just need to add the addresses and the subject line . these selected pictures are already attached as attach@@ ments .
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of receiving emails . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . their configuration is stored and used each time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify in the Command button below the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must install the G@@ mail agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after selecting the comments in a attached file , comments to images in a text file added and the mail are added .
the P@@ NG format under the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the loss @-@ free formats such as T@@ IFF . you should therefore have to use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG image file format and files the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ data are added to that pictures .
when the process is ready , the window will not automatically shut down , so you can view the status reports on the search for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . by the button lets you s@@ lie this window ? en .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have displayed your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ trans@@ itions range in the presentation use very elegant field trans@@ itions by Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the file names indicate that the file names are displayed in the left @-@ hand corner during the presentation .
the loop makes it all displayed in an endless loop , you can manually start with Es@@ c .
the option images acci@@ dentally choose that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so , no sequence of pictures are used in the album .
under delay between the pictures , the tim@@ ely distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should see this one before you &apos;ll show your friends !
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itional effects of which you can choose . by chance , choose from any transition between images a different effect .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left screen . move the mouse into this corner by you .
with this tool bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , stop the previous and the next image and stop the slide .
on the left screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .

&amp; photo album ; gives you two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures . the one is integrated into &amp; photo album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user &apos;s book , it is described in &amp; photo album ; integrated version which you can create over the menu file HTML ... click on .
before HTML pages will be created you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas of content , layout and purpose . in the following , each area will be more accurate .
first , enter the title of the over@@ clock and a description which should contain the HTML file later . upon photo album ; HTML example page you see an example of this settings .
next , choose if a &amp; photo album ; -@@ Export file is to be seen on the overview page . you can find information about export files you &apos;ll find in .
last , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . by this way , you can avoid that information is displayed without a description . for example , you can &apos;t use pictures of a party . note that each pictures are exported . you can not use this attitude to hide certain pictures from particular viewing .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most of the settings are unique , which is why it is not particularly received .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions on the images . therefore , those who want to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x@@ 600 , no more images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the dis@@ solution at any time you have specified . so he can get your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this installation area , you place the different folders and URL where your website is stored .
best , select a basic folder for all your HTML files , and for each next set , a new sub@@ folder .
first you must select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the future images . here you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if they are really all visible to the viewer . if you have created for the basic folder , a web browser , after the pages will be created , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will restart in the wrong folder .
in the case that the HTML files produced by you do not have to copy it manually . thus , the import @-@ function , see , correctly , you must specify the final target of files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the ones described just described above were based on basic folders and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder will be used , whose name you set up in the output file .
if you are looking for a family party , a meeting or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo album ; you may need to add a HTML page to viewing the pictures . however , you can add a HTML page to viewing the pictures , then you have to add with &amp; photo album ; this work is not even going to do .
with &amp; photo album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the image characteristics are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it if the pictures itself are stored in the file , or if in the file it is only a link to pictures , that you can have all pictures together and so independent . the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the pictures in a double way . first searches , the images of the URL , which you have provided in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file , are searched carefully . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for Export Graphics is described , which you can export over the menu file .
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it should act on internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three sel@@ ections available :
when you select manuals near the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file , you will have to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
using the Autom@@ atically option to copy the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file copy &amp; photo album ; the pictures automatically switches for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it &apos;s usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you would like that , just select the export file option .
the last option of this page contains maximum image size . if you are sending your friends images , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file might be very large . here you can limit the size by clicking on the maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with .@@ k@@ im from your web browser or from the menu file Imp@@ orting ... select , will import &amp; photo album ; the exported database as described in .
the assistant to imports consists of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import , after that , in which file the import images should be copied .
it can be that you person@@ alise the category persons to the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is required for your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialogue window , which are imported categories of the imported file , and which categories are described in your database .
in the fourth step , you can equal the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example will be seen on the picture .
it must be simple to search images and look : if you look at pictures , you want to view images from different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you are looking for example pictures of your Italy vacation , you might want to see any pictures with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) Please check out the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) the searches and look at ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it was expanded and today also takes your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about images , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; K@@ photo album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . it is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. nor@@ mals or revisions in CVS , back where they want .
&amp; photo album ; remember the file where your pictures are stored and used this with future starts . if you want to read another database with pictures , you can start &amp; photo album ; using the -@@ c option . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
on the menu entry , photo album settings ; set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo album . in the following section of user guide you will be explained to you the various settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with whom you can call your imagination and options for the viewer . for each setting , an exhau@@ st@@ ive help is available , which allows you to set up a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described as you can design@@ ate various properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
in view of the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a lab@@ eling and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a Mitt@@ en@@ lie@@ ds as explained .
in view of the installation options , which are available to you for determining the members of the members . you can choose the category you wish to configure . in the left window is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; K@@ photo album ; share its module with other graphics applications , such as di@@ gi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug @-@ in interface . you can find information on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed through the menu modules . however , the modules can &apos;t be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; photo album ; however , most modules have a help page which you can call on the module itself .
since the modules can be used together with each other , it can be that the modules have been tested with the demo database ; it is why you can test new modules first with the demo database before you call them on your own pictures . demo _ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . do not say I &apos;d never warned you !
the applications that use modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; photo album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you share functions with various applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can &apos;t use their images in albums : this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order to albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; photo album .
sim@@ ulates &amp; recorded photo album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , thus displays all pictures that show you the picture gallery at the moment .
besides the current album &amp; photo album , the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s the following :
if &amp; photo album ; s Browser displays the content of a category , for example , all people , then each entry will represent an album for the module .
or it will be the category you have specified in the installation dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you select the category people , you will have posted a photo album and so do if you have selected people to view this and the module .
since some modules with &amp; photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog , and select the modules that modules are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you can start &amp; photo album ; with your own pictures .
as you are acc@@ ust@@ omed to any other K@@ DE application , you &apos;ll see the window with which you can bro@@ wse your image database . in the section we will not show any information about your pictures . in the section we will show you on this window , now click on the page pictures , which shows you an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; photo album ; is the possibility to see every image with notes . this includes information on the persons appearing on the image etc . you can either play each image individually or for a larger number of pictures , at the same time . if depicted on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all images in Copenhagen were recorded .
all these notes can be used for searching and bro@@ w@@ sen as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can set three lists with a text field by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album ; because you will always be able to use information about your pictures .
the following idea is the shift of images included within the list : for example , if you are depicted a family re@@ union and in all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can find that the used names are moved up to the top that can be found faster and arrange .
in case you prefer to have a alpha@@ be@@ tically listed list , click on the icon for sorting according to the list .
if you have selected remarks on each image individually , you might want to edit all selected pictures and add these images with notes . Click this case simply on the front and back buttons , which are located below the preview of the picture right up .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , have taken , it may be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu option multi @-@ entries to use with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California . in addition there are San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the register dialog@@ s there is possible to add a entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also find an entry into a category and place there in order to make this entry into a sub@@ category this entry . attention , this is ahead you &apos;ve just alpha@@ be@@ tically sort your categories . see also .
you can shift the individual elements of the register dialog@@ s by clicking and move the upper edge of the frames , click and move . you can also make a separate window by rolling it out of the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs to be satisfied with the settings , click on the button Op@@ tions ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current construction and look of the window .
you can also let a frame completely wi@@ ped out . if you wish to get this window again later , use the button options ... and then click on the window . this process will be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in your browser , you will receive an overview of pre @-@ illustr@@ ating images of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you have no filters here . you can configure the size of th@@ umb@@ nails , by simply by drawing the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply .
if you have a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it is displayed in picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window open with a picture viewer , a new ad window is created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete , and select either the remove key , or select the menu option . now , you &apos;ll show the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; my photo album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use images to have stored on the hard disk . of course you have to record the pictures somewhere , so that you can see the view of &amp; photo album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo album ; if not all needed pictures of the hard disk can be loaded .
images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , images are present , such as pictures ; you can view the preview of these images . however , you can view these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you can see , this function will require you to copy files from folders and copy it again . so , if you want to avoid the insert of your images , you can &apos;t buy a larger hard drive to save all pictures on it .
in the menu Images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy you want to view the pictures so that you may wish to see for other un@@ appro@@ ach@@ able view . alternatively , you can also view all the pictures that you may see your little sister may control , control , and menu entry all other than in recent view .
with this , you have set what images should be hidden in the case of anything . if you have a laptop now to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , so all pictures you &apos;ve locked out will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures once more , click on lock .
it is also possible to commit a password to un@@ lock the pictures . to install this password , select password in the menu privacy .
please consider that this picture protection is not very secure in case of this picture . for one , everyone can read or delete the password as un@@ turn@@ key text . this kind of password protection is only used to den@@ ounce that with &amp; photo album ; not very familiar to the view of private images .
the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it , of course you want to consider them sometime . for this reason you can look at some time . for this reason you can see them from preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have about the image , like who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ Box is in the top part of the picture you want to see , so you can configure them with the mouse . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , look , matching entries to this show . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you select people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons very high and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu .
when several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . then you can download a new picture after a few seconds . how often it can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus or Min@@ us . started and hal@@ ted the slide by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful capacity of the viewer &apos;s album and photo album ; it is used to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can easily move in the image and zoom out . to the mouse button you can easily move out . using the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out into the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not zo@@ omed . with the uni@@ formity , the zo@@ oms sets the zo@@ oms so that each pixel is equivalent to a pixel &apos;s pixels .
note that the only zo@@ oming operations that work for videos that are coming in and out zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ a@@ ste .
rotate the shooting functions from the context menu . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu option notes from the context menu .
if you can look at pictures you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can view the viewing and configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , they may prefer to mark the picture and consider further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you &apos;ll view one after another .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features while you are viewing . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you can print the corresponding letters . see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , these are available to you in your browser . so , if you have all pictures you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , you can use one module to copy the selected pictures on a CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and particularly features can be shown in the preview view . if you can view these categories in D@@ re preview view , then you can add features to the pictures by simply press the character for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you can watch &amp; photo album ; painting on the picture .
the painting is not stored in the image , but in the database . on the way you can revers@@ ed your gem@@ s later .
in a picture you can see on the painted picture . in order to un@@ lock the painting mode of &amp; photo album ; please click on the picture from the context menu . to finish the painting you simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar on the window .
in order to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling , you have to use the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete rule , but the documentation too &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood .
in the object @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously , but not the object of a selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected using the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool bar , or select a menu entry in the menu insert .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following procedure will be built , so that you can choose the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on application to take these changes . if you have invali@@ d values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can view the input commands , and then click on application or dis@@ card changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains user documentation .
when you edit a texture or a part of texture , you can see a preview of Your Own View .
press on preview in the Capital View and a small example of the scene is ri@@ pped by the chosen texture . as default , if you want to create one texture in texture map ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross locally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button , and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear , and it will display a small cross in the wire @-@ model view . this cross is marked the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a visibility stage . you can specify it relative to the level of the superior object or as an absolute value . objects are only then displayed if selected are or their visibility stage less or equal to the scene of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ed , it has a window order form as default . the object @-@ tree and view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can save it any time . you can also save several window orders and change between different arrangements .
to insert a window over or below a view , drag the link to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle will then display the new position .
to create a new column , drag the link to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view , extending over the whole height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the arrival in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flash@@ card re@@ iter above in the views .
the last possible window order form are floating views : views which are not embedded in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the arrival on the Desktop , or click on the little to the left top arrow in the An@@ de@@ bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the An@@ fe@@ eder bar . to prevent the left , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location .
the current window view allows you to save with view window order ... store . it will be a dialog displayed in which you can store the window order below an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ed ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual is written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 relevant . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; version 1.0 not supported .
to render the current scene , click the symbol Ren@@ dering The symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool bar , or select the menu entry point of scene .
a R@@ ender mode is equivalent to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s In@@ i files . it defines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to set a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can insert many R@@ ender modes , from a quick look to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender or in the tool@@ bar , or in the R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu ... select the following dialog :
every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name any name , but it is useful to recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the check box section and give the image section to the ren@@ dering in the input fields .
in the combination field , you can select the characteristics that use &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflective photoelectric sensor . a detailed description of R@@ ender properties can be found in the user guide book &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is drawn with only one beam per pixel , various errors can be produced . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in bends and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . in general , see images with this property better .
if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive way ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive , because each pixel is continuously split and adap@@ tive because the score of records depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam of pixels . if you adjust the difference between the values to the adjacent pixels , then both pixels are calculated using a particular additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the depth value of 4 additional points , a grid of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the following threshold is higher , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be followed individually and can be tested for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the records can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you place j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map map , you can adjust if the alpha channels will be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have not met an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console input . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file import@@ ing ... and select a file from the dialog box .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers are currently supported ; not yet the complete control sum@@ mer@@ ing of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if , when import@@ ing errors or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
you can extract objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . this adds the source code to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply mark the source code and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the Capital View , click &amp; Bl@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . please ask the path to your Doc@@ umentation and Version . it supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example al@@ tim@@ bers ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the file of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is used in different ways of the library , the first folded file is used .
the colour for wire versions . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the colour for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected controls .
the color of the rectangle for the viewing field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type characteristic .
you can adjust the objects on the button in the context menu of the Settings menu set . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling , and rotation .
larger values give a more accurate wire model and therefore a better se@@ wing for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects , such as the ball , you can adjust the detail level for two directions .
when you cross high detail work for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided into , if the camera uses an enhanced projection . expanded projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to the projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you indicate a wall , a wall is mounted behind the objects . the wall is shown in a check@@ er@@ board pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you cross the floor , a ground is below the objects . the floor is shown in a check@@ er@@ board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you are activ@@ ating cant@@ e@@ zation , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for the ren@@ dering of scenes is used . the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . more information regarding the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can create existing window arrangements , or create new window orders . in section window orders , you can create and store shut@@ ters .
the Combin@@ ation field Standard window arrangement : displays all existing window frames . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; uses the chosen window order in the start of the program .
the list preceding window frames shows all existing window arrangements . you can create a new arrangement with the button and remove a selected arrangement with the button .
every window order is identified by name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views of the chosen windows arrangement . new views can create and remove selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with New column create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ locks , you will receive a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and viewing the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ed ; installed and now you want to follow no more specific knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tut@@ orial , you should be able to create the ultimate , simple scene , among beginners : a sphere on a plane .
but you should consider following war@@ nings if you are compl@@ aining that you will receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , do not use rules for ren@@ dering , as a result you can obtain a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you &apos;ll only get a black picture .
if you have everything faul@@ t@@ less installed , you will see from the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ed ; following default shut@@ ters :
take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation , so you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ed ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu entry to edit . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wireless model view shows how the camera is watching the whole scene . in particular , note that in the fourth wire @-@ model view ( right below ) , this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the results of the scene of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new record with the name camera . if you click on it , you &apos;ll find the content of view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details .
do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera , this is future instructions reserved , but notice that the camera can change in the viewing point , with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click on the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position .
if you press the button or press the input , change the wire model views and the object @-@ tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you might add a cube ( inser@@ tion end body qu@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an aw@@ k@@ ward approach to the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; indeed offers a simpler opportunity . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : select the plane in the object tree , change the name and then press the button applic@@ ation@@ or the input . in the object tree , the new name is immediately shown .
the wire model view is also showing the plain , although at the moment only as a limited end@@ ental level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane bends forward .
if you &apos;re looking at the object tree , you &apos;ll notice that you can check out the input for each new object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit among the horizontal line , just allow you to know some of these parameters . select a shift and set the values as follows :
first choose the bottom to set up its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something special at the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can select how the object should be inserted . the pig@@ ment will then change in the object tree . you can see the name in the property view ( name = Ground pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button you see how the pig@@ ment now looks like .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a m@@ attes black material because you can check the appearance of materials anytime with a click on a preview . also , there are many possibilities for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities , but take now the sim@@ pl@@ est .
if you look no color on Qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , click on the button application and then click the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color name . here are further settings required . in the colour list you need to insert two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do it more frequently , but the box color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , choose any colours , and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step you should already be able to run , as you should have understood the basic version of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling ; already understood . the ball can be just as easy as the ground :
in the view of object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input or button to press ) , so the ball has got contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would have moved across the floor to the bottom .
of course , the ren@@ dering makes now a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface is like a m@@ ist black material . put an appropriate material in the following step .
if you have selected the ball , you can now as@@ sign a material now . like the bottom , enter the sphere a pig@@ ment as colour :
choose stor@@ my object and change the name for example in the pig@@ ment . Click on the pig@@ ment , select , and set the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects , if you take time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen pictures and click on users or press the input .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already give up some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal is still not selected :
you should now have a good impression of what opportunities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; offers . hopefully you have learned so much you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ tra@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you prefer a scene , the Ren@@ derer hypo@@ the@@ tical radi@@ ance from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , which ren@@ ders the scenes ) by any pixel . the rav@@ ender will be calculated using the visu@@ als of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects are processed for pixels . so , the scene is pixel &apos;s pixels .
as you can imagine , you &apos;ll see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with whom you see the scene . without a light source you &apos;ll also see nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously every scene needs to be prevented , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in default file dialog , you can select a file that you made with &amp; co@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers before ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . is it a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been dis@@ car@@ ded since the last storage .
you can only select this menu entry only if you have not stored any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last reverse order . this menu entry only can then select if you have used editing .
store the current window order and opens a dialog , in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; here you can change the appearance , the key short@@ cut and the standard behaviour .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; change commands , or add new commands .
open a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove them with this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling .
a B@@ ump map is a possibility to mod@@ ulate rough surfaces without any buttons on the surface , without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
plots are simple geomet@@ rical forms which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are made from dozens of or even hundreds of these plots . these models are then processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color on pixel @-@ based , by using a picture file as color map .
&amp; ku@@ ppe show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application features a file browser where you can select pictures for viewing .
pictures can either be displayed in a separate window in size , image or screen mode .
the use of &amp; out@@ feed show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return .
you can adjust if any image should be displayed in one of its own window , or if all pictures should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file in the browser window . then , if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog insert - &amp; out@@ feed show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , Android and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of editing and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cut can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can further down below . default is not full screen mode .
is this point activ@@ ates , downloads &amp; c@@ ick@@ ness ; already the next image in the folder while you still choose the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for sli@@ deshow .
with this option stores &amp; sn@@ ick@@ ness ; at the end opens the name of the last opened folder . next start opens &amp; c@@ apped show ; this folder in the browser window .
Click on the colored beams to select a background colour . this is used in order to fill the background of screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , here the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; sn@@ ick@@ Show ; then set up that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window is enlarged by the full screen . this option is switched to default for default .
determines whether the slide show will begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time interval between a slide change . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the Command field . the default setting is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is reset to 0 , the slide show is repeated so long until it is interrupted by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the Command field . default is 1 .
here , change the key@@ note for the various business cards of &amp; c@@ ick@@ Show ; in the flash@@ cards sh@@ orts for the display window and short commands for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the folder and window for files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays big icons for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
displays th@@ umb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
shr@@ inks the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
virtually enlar@@ ges the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; c@@ ick@@ Show ; also closed when no browser window is opened .
show the picture in original size . this is only useful if the automatic scale is activated .
open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; photo editing based on &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; photo machining . &amp; show photo ; is part of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; project .
&amp; show photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; K@@ DE ; is &amp; show photo ; an open source project . this means that the user reports part to it , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ case photo ; makes it as easy as possible mistakes or possible improvements to report . wherever you are in the program , your browser contains a link to reports from problems and wishes . if you are using this , your browser will open a page to reports from problems and wishes . all required information is already filled , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show@@ case photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are able to help each other . if you &apos;re interested in any user of &amp; show@@ case , you may wish to answer any other questions of &amp; show@@ case . in this mail@@ ing@@ list you will find English speaking , you should be powerful therefore in this language .
the best start to join &amp; show photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list join . guide to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show photo ; .
show you can see much control over his work processes as possible . there are many options to access the behavior of &amp; show photo ; you &apos;ll need to show on these settings , you need to set up on these settings . you can change between these settings , by pressing between these settings , by pressing on the symbols of the left side .
in the range of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed if the under@@ line or over@@ load rot@@ ator should be selected , the colors with what you want to indicate in contrast . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ load a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ case photo ; possesses a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and promotions to the selected pictures . you can also view these photos in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; Can@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not make more than images and enhance them .
&amp; Can@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and add images that do not make more than images and save images or save images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also view images in front of the store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; channels ; with the command , l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner can not be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog can open to selecting the scanner .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . finish off &amp; release .
the further settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; can@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not very special .
to install an image , the user can only start a disc and then scan them for the final scan . the forward scan is started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and out from the current selection out zo@@ oming . it can also adjust the zoom that the whole preview can fit into the window .
when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you select a preview in the settings , then the image is displayed in a preview window , as below is displayed , then the picture will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demol@@ ition and you go back to the main window .
by the kno@@ b settings the same name is opened before the main window . you can change here the most important settings .
the user can view the picture , if desired , consider before saving . in this case the option must be selected on Save a preview . if this preview of user is not desired , then the option has to be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; Can@@ l@@ ite ; images to select . dialog for each image opens up the dialog in front of each one @-@ called image . if &amp; Can@@ l@@ ite opens it automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must be asked to ask for a file name .
this setting defines where images are stored in the storing without any file name . if the images are stored in any scan , this folder will be used as standard for the save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ....
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically save images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog to store . the automatically stored picture gets a num@@ eric covering of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # character is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adapt the image quality to save image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE assistance with the &amp; can@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button over starts the K@@ DE about -@@ dialog for &amp; channels ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing system can be used to finish &amp; channels .
li@@ l@@ ite ; is under the GP@@ L licensed and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , which is used by &amp; Import , under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs key@@ chains . below you can set up a list of these pump@@ kin and select your function . the global key short@@ cut can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player windows and select a key keyboard short@@ cut by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window and select short commands ... Select .
you may be able to set up existing multimedia buttons that they work as &amp; amar@@ ok ; short commands are functioning . this allows you to make your keyboard for &amp; amar@@ ok ; control centre .
the D@@ COP interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP function will be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and K@@ DE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ sharing options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script may not be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script , if all necessary modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user may not run why a script is not running .
requested &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos;
in folder scripts or templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required features . you will quickly find that the letter of scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ COP can exchange your scripts containing Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be connected to any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable the output of external programs and commands . in this case , d@@ co@@ p &gt; function can be accessed relatively straightforward . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be accessed quite simply . here is an example in Python :
&amp; amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default settings and respond correspon@@ d@@ ingly to events . of course , a script will ignore the events if there is no use of it .
configure the script , configure the setup dialog . to store the Save and store of setup data each script must take care of . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder , where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is all@@ u@@ ded . the script is now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions for further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volume @-@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is a unit value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ iz@@ ni@@ ated : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title : contains the path to the selected files of play@@ list , when a user @-@ defined menu entry can also be added to the script it can use d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script add@@ ressing men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ ap ) to remove one entry to remove d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ title ) .
before &amp; amar@@ ok will end , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do so , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ a script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server ; such packages are in the reason normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can also be downloaded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 is only allowed to accept script packages with the Extended Res@@ identi@@ al script . for that reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages at the same point .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ Parameter @-@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script is ready , you can download it at www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i script site of &amp; amar@@ ok . you should use the category amar@@ ok , scripts and scripts .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features , but is still surprising to use .
with &amp; amar@@ ok , you can simply draw music into the play@@ list instead of going through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for only a certain title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos;@@ s collector browser and the quick search will be found within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right one for you . and if your decision is still difficult , choose the dynamic mode and the intelligent re@@ play@@ lists automatically choose the right music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . moreover , many other useful features make Amar@@ ok to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ live your music !
typically , you have to enter the base folder of Amar@@ ok sources , to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok , and install :
da &amp; amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not comp@@ ile any difficulties when you encounter problems . if you encounter problems , please report this in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mail@@ ings list .
&amp; amar@@ ok , just as most applications enable some options to enable or dis@@ able the compilation with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies need to be fulfilled , so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements .
activ@@ ates deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; amar@@ ok : can be implemented without trouble on the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; amar@@ ok .
in addition , the Player window displays , in addition to the play@@ list , respectively . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window is displayed .
pro@@ longed wait : this feature is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the voting barrier .
re@@ design : this feature is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . therefore , the color scheme for the mood has been modified .
file files from the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . otherwise , the file files are stored on the location of corresponding music files . otherwise , the file files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok . saved ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you select which browser of &amp; amar@@ ok will be started when a browser is needed .
other brows@@ ers are : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not listed in the list .
play@@ list when saving , save the current play@@ list automatically with the end of &amp; amar@@ ok ; dis@@ able this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list .
relative paths to manual stored play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , &amp; amar@@ ok will be ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the play@@ list , otherwise the absolute position of music files is stored .
a lot of pieces in the play are visible , resulting in the play@@ lists window , to keep the current number always in the visible window area .
when switching to the context of the context , automatically changes the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is all@@ u@@ ded .
in the section of the appearance you can adapt and amar@@ ok . the section is sub@@ part in three parts .
in font section , you can use the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise you can select writings to select the following areas : play@@ lists windows , player window and context browser . press on selecting ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of user @-@ defined colour scheme , you own the qu@@ al of choice and can design@@ ate its own color scheme . in addition , use the choice of colour choice for front and background colour .
playing at the start , that &amp; amar@@ ok will continue , after the program launch , playback automatically starts with the play on the spot , which has been stopped at the end of the end .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to restri@@ ct the switching of the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can consider the effect of all settings in this preview area .
the first option is the font . Click on selecting the dialog to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shade causes the text in the O@@ SD is illustrated .
your own colors will give you the option to suit the O@@ SD colour for writing and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if suit@@ ability is not activated , the pre @-@ set &amp; K@@ DE ; colors are used .
the input field Display text display the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by type of plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to its needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama @-@ users . thus , you can define , on which screen a multiple @-@ monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers will enable another adjust@@ ing possibilities in this card card .
the card card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , which is &amp; amar@@ ok , search for music files . to include a file into the collection , mark the check box in addition to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting up as with the selected folders .
brows@@ ers : this causes that &amp; amar@@ ok causes , both the crossing and their sub@@ folders will be bro@@ wse through music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected file added to changes ( e.g. music files added or delete ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to carry the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists import : results that &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection file ( .@@ pl@@ - and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) will be added to your collection . later , the play@@ lists will appear later .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the Combin@@ ation Field Dri@@ vers : can be selected between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another device in the main window of MySQL is needed .
the MySQL @-@ device is used to set the database for &amp; amar@@ ok . under machine : will host the computer database . afterwards , under port : the network port is typ@@ ed under which the database is achie@@ vable . name : is the database name , to which the connection is made .
use us@@ ername : and password : to enter data that will be needed for connection to the database .
the card modul@@ .@@ f@@ m as@@ sures the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and need to create music recommendations regarding the current quantity .
here enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one at the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send dis@@ able pieces and updating the profile : this setting allows you &amp; amar@@ ok , to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters : after activation of this setting is &amp; amar@@ ok , a list with similar interpre@@ ters of each piece can be accessed . note : you may not need a load in the context of context . note : you need not need a load @-@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the features and the gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you need to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including those contained in it , because &amp; amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to be written for example modules or scripts ) , how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD is prec@@ eded that your window manager will hold the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . however , we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these represent an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files gets an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library to days . you can also edit the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log , and you can also delete the broken file that has caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
most of these mostly is that Tag@@ li@@ b of read the met@@ a information from this file crashing . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for that in &amp; amar@@ ok is somewhat more mature .
make sure all of &amp; amar@@ ok will be compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example &amp; amar@@ ok , but with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x was compiled , this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate automatic mode . turn off when in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail is automatically open to a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring dist@@ ortion and you can send us a good back@@ trace , the bug is guaranteed .
this is that many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ info , but this is not known as Unicode . the following Perl script raises the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error in writing of tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ E &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random playback / repet@@ ition / Dynamic play@@ list ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can simply fix the symbol effects on grey and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases you have to click on an icon , until this attitude will show its effect .
if you receive this error : icon look@@ up error : icon look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ .@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if am@@ aro@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ or amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you might need to remove any col@@ li@@ ant Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .conf instead , that am@@ aro@@ K will find the correct version first .
there are several ways . most inst@@ aller problems are easiest because the help of an expert on Unix or lin@@ ux distribution . you can also search help from other users or for the developers . use the Forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help to seek help . please enter a mistake there if something is located on the correction of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok , only an empty play@@ list appears . how do you get it into music ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folders . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start @-@ up window was converted into the statistics window . you will find it under ex@@ tras .
the meaning of these icons have changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are available for the evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate its pieces , the play@@ list must be displayed in the play@@ list of the play@@ list . Click here to the new evaluation column to determine the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from play@@ list from the screen menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list and let them fall there , just like you would do it with other files . so simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the Add @-@ button , the button will save play@@ list . Click on it .
presumably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; amar@@ ok . now look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is available in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras .
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok . uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual issue is supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ 5mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support like pretty any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ mail can even add text and P@@ NG !
it may be ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where@@ with the default of no MP3 decoder ( of pat@@ ent@@ ric reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , input a@@ ste
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; amar@@ ok , plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ rec@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender , allowing multiple applications to use the device at the same time . this can be achieved by a sound card using hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software @-@ Mixer ) .
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem and a solution . you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
this is doing &amp; amar@@ ok , already . don &apos;t forget that media first need to de@@ code . G@@ ather does not simply look for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ ather reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can issue directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of the Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real@@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ is@@ ra@@ pper can be set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause pin@@ ched r@@ end@@ ition . read this bug report . enlarge The Sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA @-@ setup file .@@ as@@ oun@@ dr@@ c can also help .
either use not use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ amp@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get complete the faster art co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ yl@@ fig . so &amp; etc ; ) .
presumably use the art driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been highly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the powder in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less applications react with visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed but if I want to switch to the G@@ aul driver , crash@@ es &amp; amar@@ ok ; down . why ?
after the G@@ etty installation you &apos;ll need to register all components and register the G@@ ST holder , to register all G@@ bps components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Store ph@@ yl@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . then run the G@@ ST @-@ register once a system manager and once as your normal user . delete the module file with G@@ ST @-@ config ( g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run the G@@ ST holder again . start now &amp; amar@@ ok .
please report on bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g if you have a list of suggestions / wishes , send them best to our mailing list : amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

in essence , this is the previous evaluation with a decl@@ ining value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has every single review on the overall result .
you can set the rating for a piece yourself by clicking with the right mouse button on a column description in the play@@ lists . then mark evaluation . then you can select the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by selecting or F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog met@@ ad@@ ata .
the developers do not want you to publish when you should post a stable version of am@@ aro@@ K . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan which is not to put together with the short @-@ term plan of am@@ aro@@ K .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please enter the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crash@@ es and also causes a lot of error reports .
probably was invented &amp; amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the / configure routine has not compiled this output modules . you have to configure &amp; amar@@ ok , re @-@ configure and install .
well , I have &amp; amar@@ ok ; new installed but the output modules are still not released . and now ?
probably use a distribution that is installed from the actual program separately . although G@@ etty is installed , the necessary Develop@@ er files . you must now install the package g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine de@@ vel ; then you need to re@@ comp@@ ile and install again .

the play@@ lists browser designed very simple to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , he also includes the play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists bro@@ ws@@ ers contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists to the run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection that never played .

the sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; amar@@ ok . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; amar@@ ok , it must be integrated in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; amar@@ ok is started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpre@@ t in the upper list of the media player brows@@ ers .
to transfer pieces on your iPod , drag the desired title from the play@@ list and let them fall on the list Interpre@@ t . if you are ready , click over to your iPod . when the transfer is complete , you finish &amp; amar@@ ok , and redeem the drive attachment for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar is a search area where you can search for a file . search is particularly useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden , which correspond to your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser is an address bar where you can pick music from a given URL . if you can take a tar : / home / Mike / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can play music from there in the musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now , you can draw the music from there in the play@@ list .
if the play@@ list is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be very difficult in the window . in this case , reta@@ ining the Shift key may be helpful : this will be inserted into the end of the list , and not on the bottom position .
the play@@ list contains all of you to play attached pieces . you can change the order by typ@@ ing the entries simply with the mouse on the desired position . once you enter the letter , only the pieces are displayed in order to reset the filter . in order to reset the filter , press the reset button until the text field is empty .
if you enter separate search terms through spaces , is &amp; amar@@ ok ; search for entries , which are all search criteria . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries , one , two , and three .
if you enter between search terms OR , according to entries , which are either the one or the other search key . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries , include the space character , then include the search term with ge@@ ese : Mike Old@@ field . thus , after entries are looking for Mike Old@@ field , but not according to entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you select a certain search engine , you can also look for bigger or smaller . for example : evaluation : &gt; 50 . this is searching for pieces , which have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece which does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces which do not contain something .
you can combine these sy@@ sc@@ outs after you . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all tracks which either contain Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 , and not the comment bad .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click on the right button on the entries . then you will receive a mark with a number . the number is identical to the sequence in which the pieces will be re@@ produced .
the play@@ list of the play@@ list is located at the bottom edge of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the play@@ list . on the left , you can add the button to the right , back to the play@@ list , empty play@@ list , empty and random@@ ized mixing .
next , you follow the buttons and restore . so you can revers@@ ed or restore any changes to the play@@ list .

the cover administration is a useful tools to manage your cover images . you can launch it by choosing actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the artist &apos;s links on the left side .
with the menu view , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover management . select from :
the qu@@ eue @-@ long administration received your major move in &amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function , you have even more control over the play@@ list . after you have set a piece in the waiting list , this number represents the order in the &amp; amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played first , 2 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
the administration of qu@@ eue ski@@ ps over extra @-@ time administration . if you want to add a piece in the play@@ list and then click on + . you can also use the pieces in the play@@ list or use the context menu in the play@@ list . the order of pieces can then change in the qu@@ eue position .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , of which two are already pre @-@ given ( the details to the establishment of these later ) .
your play@@ list with random pieces of your entire collection and plays random pieces during play .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your play@@ list . you do not need a load @-@ f@@ m @-@ profile to make this dynamic re@@ play@@ list .
just click on the desired play@@ list , drag them into the play@@ lists window or click with the right mouse button on it and then select loading . in this way , your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new play@@ list !
the two pre@@ set Mo@@ di random mix and play@@ lists mix immediately complete your play@@ list and you can add the play@@ list Recomm@@ ended pieces starting with an empty play@@ list and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will each be added next to the next piece , therefore your play@@ list will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current play@@ list , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing play@@ list as starting point . on the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the button Rein@@ fill the current play@@ list and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the play@@ list and you can change the corresponding settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic re@@ play@@ list , you have the option to click on Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to the editing settings of the play@@ list .
here , enter any name for the play@@ list . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this attitude is not active , your play@@ list will grow continuously , the setting for upcoming pieces will be passed over and they will not be able to listen to this play@@ list . however , if the attitude is active , the plays are already played at the respec@@ ting the play@@ mate pieces .
split pieces - this is the number of played pieces that are to be kept at the beginning of the play@@ list . thus , you can easily see which pieces were played recently .
this is the number of items added to the play@@ list . if you set here more than 1 , then the play@@ list will grow continuously because only one piece is played and removed .
the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left of the dialog , you can already cross the play@@ lists or intelligent play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , &amp; amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the requested play@@ lists .
some scripts allow their own settings . you can adjust the settings by setting the script and then click on it .
you can install new &amp; amar@@ ok ; scripts can be installed by clicking on the script . after installing the script , select a new entry in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet . use the button for further scripts .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . please click on to delete the script automatically .
if you are searching for information to write their own scripts , please check in the section letter from scripts .
the dialog box visu@@ alis@@ er plug @-@ ins is used to activate the available visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations in &amp; amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . in order to use a plug @-@ in , you simply activate the check box beside the name .
this quick instructions will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; b ; in four steps you can create an audio CD . to trace the steps , you must have a li@@ mp@@ se installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , and a file with audio files .
this is a dialogue window in which you can select which files you want to burn on CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 &apos;s or other low @-@ loss compressed formats , remember that you replace a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by any los@@ s@@ less format . for this purpose , use au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialogue window , you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has completed the burning process .
this quick instructions will show you how to copy and copy a data CD in only four steps . to trace the steps below , you must have a li@@ mp@@ se installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you have to set the Qu@@ ell CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
for copying a data CD , please select Extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you can now see a dialogue with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the button Start button . now you can see a dialog box like that or something like :
in this dialogue window , you can track the progress of the copy . once the reading of the original in the image file is complete , you will be asked to an empty CD medium on which the data is burned .

cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . these programs are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio @-@ data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis is benef@@ ited from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality m@@ peg video decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio @-@ layers layer I , layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
lame : a far developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial encoding . lame is used by the MP3 Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t wma file to burn them on an audio CD @-@ CD .

norm@@ alize : this tool will be useful to adjust the volume of music files onto a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creation of mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections . without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of various albums can lead to the un@@ pleasant effect that the music pieces can be played differently according to the same effect .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start the CD and automatically play all the videos on the CD &apos;s basic folders .
this is a comfortable way , newly opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . Click on a record opens the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file is over@@ written , otherwise it is asked after a new file name .
store the current project using a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save will be displayed by selecting the file and file name for the project file .
stores all open @-@ opened projects . this is the same as if you would like to store for each single project file .
includes the current project . if a project changes and still not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; based on what should happen . you can then also break between stores and modifications . furthermore , you can also break down and keep the project so open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project , which is meant to happen , just as if you were called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each stored project this project is asked , which is supposed to be done as if you had called the file .
if you call this entry , you can select about the released dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you select the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialogue &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the features dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning process can only open when the project contains data .
open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can carry out many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them will be described above what is this ? help ( reachable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you use files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful if you are using files for a multi @-@ session CD , even if this function is not used , so that you can see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes me to remove imported files from the current project . all other files will remain in the project . this function removes any files from the medium , it only displays the previously imported files .
open the CD copying dialog . this also allows the copy of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create a picture of a CD that you can burn after sometime later . moreover , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copy . you should also try to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD copy @-@ dialog . this also allows the copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only provide a copy of a DVD with the help of copying dialog . furthermore , the target medium has to be large enough to absorb the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW drive . by doing so , you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
open the dialog to form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely er@@ ased . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , lets you choose between the writing modes and incre@@ mental .
burning an earlier CD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ rescue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not yet supported yet , so you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously shown DVD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
an earlier DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window will usually be used for reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used all@@ ot@@ ically . it contains information about the video , coding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the inserted tape . this information is shown in the table view and include features of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
when it is crossed , a small body is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information on the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden .
switches the folder view one or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents are activated , their content is shown in the table view . CD / DVD drives also have a cont@@ ex@@ tual menu with functions such as media information , locks and un@@ locking of the drive or throw of the medium .
this site turns one or off . the contents of the table allows you to select and draw files into the projection screen . the table view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if an drive was selected with a CD / DVD in the folder view .
switches the head@@ count in the project view one or off . the head@@ thing is a nar@@ ro@@ wer range , which is only visible if the project view has open projects . the cop@@ h@@ ort has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this gives a dialogue window to change the keys of keys for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . after one of the available commands in the upper part has chosen you can adjust the key rules further down .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistance systems . thus , system administrator can be set up to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator right will need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be carried out . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended to person@@ alise and custom@@ ize the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can use either the command line d@@ co@@ p , or that something more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , therefore , more your taste and type of your task will be crucial , which of the enclosed programs will be given .
in this chapter we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started ; then enter something like that at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program are in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts mentioned below .
the D@@ COP interface &apos;s standard D@@ COP interface is &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions to create new projects .
COP@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ .com Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ .com Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ .com Project ( ) The COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ .com ( ) B@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ .com ( ) ( ) , bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) , bur@@ n@@ c image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) , bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one can create a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly created project : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ interface , which is applicable only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
loc@@ alization Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String containing ) , p@@ add@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : List List , Q@@ String ) ( Q@@ String path ) , ren@@ ame It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String @-@ Name ) with set@@ al@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String )
with this , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several files , and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ .com / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / home / tru@@ ste@@ .@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; it is an audio CD ; it can easily be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder &apos;s installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator : is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and from many co@@ di@@ ers who are currently co@@ en@@ code for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) . additional co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if installed ) .
first the titles of &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed to the MP@@ 3- or OGG format , or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , the reading of &amp; CD ; is used by &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia has been used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already been installed . however , all these programs are usually not necessary to comp@@ ile it . however , only if FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary .
which code file / file format should be used ? see Chapter Wel@@ ding Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction about coding , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . if not the firmware version of the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection . in any case , &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only one must be done ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , afterwards the daily handling is explained to read a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble over at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which co@@ di@@ ers programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from free@@ DB or free@@ DB can work completely without a network , where everything is covered manually .
this is only a brief list of commands from the main window . on the side step , for example , you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program &apos;s configuration .
starting on request , the CD@@ DB will start the CD data according to the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online ) , in the latter case must first be connected to the internet . )
starts editing and , when a Encoder has been configured in the Code index tab , encoding the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that you can read the option with another encoder as the standard . it is to be observed that previously the Encoder has been configured in the encoding settings in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that a selected file will be selected to en@@ code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code reading .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as protocols , p@@ ie@@ p@@ ses ) for programme events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different card cards ( like Encoder , to set the encoding ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ ach@@ erer and compression rates and helps you in choosing the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression , MP3 and OGG files are the most common . OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ No so &apos; free , lame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to high @-@ quality sound quality ( at high rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG cutting sets is present .
MP3 - When music is also heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 , these devices mainly support the MP3 format .
a brief list with parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer to most people and most musi@@ pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of titles . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ ster@@ e@@ systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you necessarily have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this attitude .
the &amp; CD ; information which are manually entered into the program via the free@@ DB program , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used together with &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the code program to create folder and file names , as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . manual or assistance to the co@@ di@@ ers tell the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; Title to the key words ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s have to be coded , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title Parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters which can be used ( = button @-@ name in the assistant ) :
that is what free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can read / enter the information , so that all other information can be downloaded from yourself in the hosts . it &apos;s to note that here is only spoken by text : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal but I ( An@@ m of the U@@ e@@ ber@@ ber : this is the author ) I &apos;m not attor@@ ney . however , nobody can prevent from the &amp; CD ; more or less value , so neither can the artist nor the music business get attached to the music business . all information can be done anyway on a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; it is active to select a check box . for use of free@@ DB can be fitted with another ( counterfeit ) address used in the system . in this kind of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used in retri@@ eving data from server ( This may only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; to use free@@ DB , the geographical position is to be used on the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth on the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online check of &amp; CD ; information about reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which output program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know it , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to be observed that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the matching distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done .
to save the selected wav files , the co@@ di@@ erer can be selected to save the desired file format . at first open , there are pre @-@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added to this tab .
the co@@ ater package must be installed from the relevant lin@@ ux distribution before the co@@ di@@ ers can be used . this is also necessary for pre @-@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . additional information on co@@ di@@ ers are located in Chapter Wel@@ fare Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Code , further information can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ alist .
that can have many causes . check out the device type of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reader use of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to put both programs with a command line in a terminal . that might give a hint on that which is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the shell CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this may give tips as you have to go forward .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use &apos; lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key words ( tags ) .
it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame on your computer . both programs should be available as a pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . however , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile a search engine as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission to own ( eg ; by using the Con@@ quer@@ or to copy something inside ) .
the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; something which probably is done only once and
the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; what a per@@ tin@@ ent &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
here we determine the using co@@ di@@ erer for compression of music ( lame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set Extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the free@@ DB file to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet download .
although we can change these settings at any time , we are probably not able to read any of any &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
the device number will be handed over to the elite program that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device number of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map of general settings . here you can &apos;t do much to do . here you can define an additional conversion . in our example everything will be loaded / entered as shown in screen photo .
only selecting incomplete information , so you will be informed when data are missing to bear witness ( tags ) .
the card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; automatically download the internet from a free@@ DB file .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; to be connected to the Internet in order to access the free@@ DB server .
the second sel@@ ector box is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry was found immediately to read the &amp; CD ; that &apos;s un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can be easily changed with Con@@ qu@@ ette &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to enter everything manually , dis@@ able the selection box and free@@ DB file is not used . however , this is worth over 620 MB in offline mode , if you use free@@ DB in offline mode , the two selection box must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up in the card card .
CD@@ DB is free@@ DB for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system which data will get the CD ? read the section via free@@ DB . just put everything in the screen photo .
mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we just want to work on the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server close by . on this way the load will be distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work as equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls are connected to the protocol of 88@@ 80 standard , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first check box should be enough .
simply take the settings from the screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
the number of allow@@ able pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore just try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross the &amp; CD ; throw out at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined files for temporary files : when you cross it , then the path / folders can be specified in which WAV files is available . if the box is not enabled , files are created in the private folder . do not forget to make this folder when you want to make something with the WAV files .
everything will enter as it is on screen photo . the command is a bit long , under circumstances , something must be bl@@ amed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is approximately 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of creation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; meeting for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of a later amendment of the Tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this sample :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : when a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each evaluation of a &amp; CD ; when you chose the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again .
this section is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard drive runs out . we will create MP3 files . first , a connection to the Internet is built , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from free@@ DB can pick up . the process of the free@@ DB must be described , must be repeated for each per@@ cent@@ ering &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD which is not yet contained in free@@ DB , the screen photos are a bit different from the data for a &amp; CD ; with successfully dispens@@ ed by free@@ DB , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of retri@@ eving them from the Internet . comments are to be found on the differences .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD to find this example . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not been done so now the &amp; CD ; into the drive , which was defined in the main window , has to be pushed .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; identified as an audio CD ; can be identified and used by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not happening then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
warning : if the &amp; CD has been successfully collected by free@@ DB , all the tracks are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD ; gives you a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion fits best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you do not have the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the Settings ) , you can also manually trigger the option of the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , but need the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - entry of CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input &apos; actu@@ ator title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered in the Command field &apos; Update &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ ally per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful retri@@ eval from the data from the free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it &apos;s always a good idea to check out the content of the CD editor ( e. g. if all the words are with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to examine whether there &apos;s any un@@ wanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you are allowed ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; you will have a look at the tab &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information from the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see in the help to the co@@ di@@ erer after , in order to obtain more information .
just select an entry that obviously coinci@@ des with the style of the c@@ ud@@ dle CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway do not provide information about the categories of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop , or Ra@@ p , for example , to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Edit@@ ors will be back and you see that the fields are already covered with the collected data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current play . the title of the piece on any case and other information you wish .
Click the next line in main window and proceed in the same way up to you all the title dates of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . be aware that the artist and the album will be displayed on the play list .
note that there is a check @-@ in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked so selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or use the button all pieces to select the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection out of the reading process , this window appears for confirmation . then click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out .
Click on the tab orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
these error message you can see if you are attemp@@ ting to work with a co@@ di@@ erer you haven &apos;t installed . pieces which have not been successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the list list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target group are not what we have entered in the example . did you checked if you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the assignment # 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , check out and coding y parallel . please note the status within the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing configur@@ able is the result un@@ clear . the employed machine with a am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem while simultaneously read and coding ( from however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is encoded , and a third order is encoded on the maintenance @-@ long period . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a short time left in the top left of the window appears .
for the successful use of &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x. or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create zi@@ pped audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; today , CVS will run as part of the cultivation media package . however , if you are already familiar with CVS , you can download a copy of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; most distri@@ butions are already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator . if you read this , you have already done the package to cultiv@@ ate it from your distribution . if you read this , you probably have done it ...
this section is aimed at people who are compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program needs to be adapted once , then the following is right for you :
a program that call@@ uses many different programs , has many variations on settings . best read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of different cards of the settings and also contains comments for the options that are not used in the example .
Hi , still on reading ? even if only the help menu click on the first stop of the program , without any reference point , as it is expected to continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
why is it ? who reads this , presumably the program has started . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot perform this manual . it is thought to do something useful or change , let it do . at least just after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agree with this proposal .
strange when you have managed to get the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , you do not need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; besides others , he has a real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ real @-@ time texts of texts also some properties that do not have other &amp; UNIX ; MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , thus should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver that is required for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included , as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the song text on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of every MIDI channel , through the lifting of the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so you in &amp; K@@ DE ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window can pull at checkout time .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( love events or text events ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the procedure used .
session support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE , during playing a song of a song , K@@ Mid starts the next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... select from the menu file . it &apos;s the usual file dialog , which allows you to select the desired song .
you can also make a file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window can drop . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and open the button playback in the tool bar , select the entry play out of the menu , or make the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece is automatically starting as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid . ( with more pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b and go .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click on the left and to the right of the Tem@@ po@@ click and so the playback speed will change . in order to get the original temp@@ o , double click on the template LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button pause , or select the menu entry break in the menu , so interrup@@ ts the space bar while no play is played , start &amp; c@@ mid ; playback .
song lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces apply tex@@ tures , others use lyrics event and another both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can adjust which events are displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined using a song , so you will have to set nothing manually . if you select the entry automatic text file , you will automatically change the kar@@ a@@ oke text , but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to set up a type of event , select from the menu settings the entries text events or lyrics . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ize . these are played in the range after you . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to install a collection , first open the collection manager . these can be found in the Menu collection under the item .... Click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then select the name for the new collection . this collection will be included at the beginning of the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the desired destination Manager .
into the temporary collection all songs , which you want to add to any other collection .
when using the application , this collection will not be saved . remember , if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , they must be selected in the Colle@@ ctions Manager . there you can add to the button adding a song . it again appears the file dialog , which allows you to select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the automatic add to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection ( using file opening or D@@ rag &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add @-@ up to the collection is not activated , then the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you &apos;ll need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on .
you can select the order in which the songs can be played . if you select a series from the sub @-@ menu pop@@ up sequence of the menus , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list on the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump a song , select the Next song , next song from the menu , or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the button below , select the previous piece from the menu , or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button .
temporary collection may not be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter if they don &apos;t have any role in leaving &amp; k@@ mi@@ de .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that understands the synthes@@ izer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all the Change patch to B@@ right piano events of Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and always sound a trumpet when it was originally supposed to play a piano .
if you only have one sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need an MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM and so on ) .
unfortunately , there is no programs to create MIDI maps . you need to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , which saves all the necessary settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear so often as desired . but the requirement for this is that each appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map &quot; ... End De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End
they see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and end that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail to get in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compliant .
in this section , the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equation is ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you must not change the order and do not change line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument need to lay on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported by a gun ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which can be similar to a tissue dietary supplement , add the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if now an MIDI file is supposed to play a touch with Patch 127 ( ri@@ bs on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch included in the patch is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ment instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one who means the pitch the pitch of the same drum ( as some keyboards have some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to indicate how sounds are depicted on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
like in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . they only need to use different names in the first row .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to form sounds at the Per@@ c@@ ur canal . look for example the provided key@@ maps .
this section can be used to mig@@ rate some channels to others . if you want to switch back to the first and second channel , make it easy for the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( general MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , constructed according to the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is displayed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key map must be defined on the front in the file ! if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example , to always use the Per@@ c@@ or Patch on the Per@@ c@@ et Canal .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied by the value of n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed to the value of 40@@ 96 , so that there is no dec@@ imal file in the Map file .
this setting is used because GM is giving that a keyboard , which is a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event , with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some keyboards to get two sounds up to one oc@@ tave above . in order to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use an MIDI @-@ map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . these can be found in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole range of piano keyboards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these cla@@ ves you see which sounds are just being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel , there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer uses the original instrument .
the Can@@ arian view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the Settings menu below the Point channel view : settings
the Tempo LCD shows the speed to play with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the temp@@ o of a song . so if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played like a music piece . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus , it can run the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians who can play the same score in very different ways .
good , I can make anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
that can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support has been compiled . to remove the problem you must download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s homepage )
I want to add a complete folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files separately .
agree , therefore supported &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , enable automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to a temporary collection .
you can select the arrow key from the template - LCD , to slow playback . to double the standard temp@@ o , click on the LCD .
I &apos;ve got on a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Desktop A &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this Desktop ( if I want to play an MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or I want to play a file , only change to the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window switch and the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding it directly to a collection , turn the automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to a temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mi@@ l and C.@@ mi@@ d. please only want to play the first file . so you set the automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then , do you decide to play B.@@ mi@@ de and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you so much ! if I listen to those songs or the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program at &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; but I &apos;m not trying to take a little time for my hobbies , but I try to collect MIDI files , make music and prove phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an expansion of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write to me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make a huge joy when you send me a postcard from your residence or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . I will send me to friends of &amp; k@@ mid . if you are sending an MIDI file , you should contact me when I might have the file already .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and from nobody wants to get money for it . I want to emphas@@ ize that I only need this programme , because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Bü@@ hler - Keep the bug that the pitch is too high for AW@@ E cards .
my thanks also is Jose L@@ us Sanchez for the testing of AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Magnus Pep@@ e , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Cor@@ des and everyone who sent me a patch , an error message or also only a supp@@ or@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians in the net that give us this wonderful Mi@@ di@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
additionally on this homepage can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ iser / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at the pictures . you can also find links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends on your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM radio device or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have sound card , you &apos;ll need to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it runs then as if you would have a sound@@ card , except that of course you cannot hear music .

the application window is made of called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally there is a information window that will only appear when information is shown in it .
it is possible to en@@ rich your favorite connections under the menu . if you want to create a list of entries , which will be played after each other , you should use the category permanent play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ archy . if you get an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the play begins with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and long play@@ list can be changed through direct em@@ aking of XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; c@@ m@@ player / player can not run through the application itself . simply click on a name for a category click on the menu view and next edit a sub@@ group will only display the XML content of this part .
after changing XML files , you have to choose from the menu , and select either the edit mode , or select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost if the processing mode left or another group will be selected without the play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation of the modes and end may be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify from &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / demo / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation of the cards needs not short to be short , it is automatically completed by opening a different source . this would be disturbed by the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a Start Animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / - ; In list tests / some examples of sessions are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported .
there is a rider for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here the path of the player and the cache size of the data center can be adjusted from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of M@@ Player .
there is no rider for this playback unit in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in play@@ list XML .
so the &amp; player player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player has to be used as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog box of the K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be used in a consol@@ es application and search for error messages related to the library &apos;s browser module . if no error occur here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
with this always a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this was also identified ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on all og@@ g files shall be used :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked after TV , the scanner can be used from configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is to use the dialog in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . here , ports should be detected ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB input .
as the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( probably this type of game playing of video equipment under Linux can also work . this is also possible to use the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
intern@@ ally , K@@ M@@ Player uses various names for the sources . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ source , d@@ v@@ d@@ source , source , v@@ cd@@ source , source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ as source . if they are activated , they start playing with the play@@ list .
is there hints as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive more qui@@ eter when I play from him ( not v@@ cd : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is root according to the device to execute the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine is starting only slowly , why do I have to check my CPU on their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ h@@ aul@@ t. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to comp@@ ile &amp; ile .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional correspondence application . under Unix @-@ like systems , is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution included . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD is needed .
the &amp; ile ; project includes a few already compiled packages of &amp; ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the c@@ ile ; website .
this manual is suitable for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; c@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation is considered . if the support for this project or documentation is requested , the contact details should be made via the c@@ ile website .
questions or comp@@ ile questions arise regarding the compilation of &amp; ile ; on or will add extensions , this should be addressed to the mailing list cont@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ area for the use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs in a graphical interface and within this simple , immediate and customized tools for this . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his possibilities to learn the Hand@@ book to Kate was attracted . users of &amp; ha@@ ste ; can be found there directly with reading the chapter of Work with the Editor from &amp; Kate ;
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is the right way to use : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . it is possible to use a La@@ ie ( English L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ macro@@ s . a less sophisticated but real@@ ist@@ ing process is that it desc@@ ends from the name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
if there is only a good impression about &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to rule good books , such as H. Cop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 ) .
just like other sig@@ nat@@ ories said &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized properties such as paper format , side mer@@ ging and text tool@@ ing is specified as well as a letter with the text \ \ . { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ \ { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ . { document } .
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; ile ; is a natural function for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; ile ; the selection of the assist@@ ants ( menu ) provides some possi@@ bil@@ ites for creating the document . there can also be some of the document related settings .
document categories : her@@ eby the type of documentation is included : article ( article ) , book &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or Custom ) .
coding : this is set the string encoding . modern systems should increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if possible , UTF @-@ 8 should be used ( correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; however , it will only be selected in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( subject to compliance with German DIN regulations ) . you should always use the creation of German texts .
new users have no need to worry . there is only a brief description of the features and further information on this section are given in the section .
&amp; ile ; offers - just like other sources of source editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the essential ) . through &amp; ile , there is a simple problem search to notice that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , you can notice it by the humble appearance of output file . however , it will save you by the high@@ lighting time and boost up .
with the automatic adjustment of environments , in case of a new command ( e.g. \ \ ) { command } ) of &amp; co@@ ile , automatically creates a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the da@@ zz@@ ing line to connect the command ( e.g. \ \ ) { command } . this function can be activated in the menu configuration . set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually divided into several elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allow the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ lim@@ ated element ) :
at the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed through a mouse click on the individual .
in creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; device file &#93; can be created , ski@@ ps &amp; ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and also other information such as the font size by &amp; tex ; or lat@@ ex . there are many tools to view , conversion and printing from DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ts@@ aber , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor that was cli@@ cked on a element in the DVI ; -@@ file has been cli@@ cked on , becomes the exact opposite of it . once on a section in lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text was cli@@ cked , becomes the appropriate place in DVI ; viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used in working with multiple files . using a master @-@ document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
fast construction : the lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result automatically displayed ( if there are no error in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode the DVI ; file can be used on each of them , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece .
when selecting the processing tool bar , the three large selection menus were developed for the rapid setting of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for the rapid integration of the document in sections , chapters , sections , ... The gener@@ alized &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box for further information is for items such as keywords , notes , notes , or references . available items are :
name : with this command , a name for one section , a picture or different element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( choose a selection box ) .
when using quote , a select list with literary ad@@ diction is indicated . in &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x , this only works if the file is necessary to create a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files can also be written in &amp; ile ; written by hand .
the last drop of box with the name of tom@@ bst@@ ones will be used for the laying of the font . it can be specified for the main text , the fox , notes etc . there are the following let@@ tering for setting :
when calling &amp; ile , two select servers are available : 1 . the wi@@ z@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and closing of the settings . 2 . the document may be written by reason on hand .
the par@@ enth@@ esis after the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font . if the font can not start at the beginning , this can also be changed in text .
once the above source code has been entered the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the source code has to be compiled . the easiest way for this is the use of men@@ ding or the button fast .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; ile ; storing the storage automatically .
if the compilation of the document failed , the log@@ ging should be sought after the errors . when using fast @-@ construction and ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the log@@ ging should also be considered .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that will be treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font size is created , and only a few terraces will have a different font . the command \ \ begin to be a different font . the command \ \ ) may be encouraged to allow the name of the font in the surroundings . ( in English Hu@@ ge ) .
changes are covered only within the environment ( from \ \ ) to { rated } to \ \ . { environment } . there is no sign@@ posted ( number ) for the changes in a environment .
there are lots of possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , grease printing , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. are available . these commands either end either with the command \ \ &apos; or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course @-@ intensive and is as long as G@@ Ã ¼ l@@ tig , until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be presented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . quote begins with \ \ ( Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ &apos; { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; drawing language is represented , then a step @-@ in @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; ile ; .
once in the assistant , a bit text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read of the document should be tra@@ cked . at least one quote , a few places in a fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem to the application , to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , an editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be turned back to the editor ( internal viewing ) . in an external viewer , the window must be closed .
as soon as the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is a large file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ depend ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ convertible or computer screen umbre@@ llas .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after the click on DVI , then the document can be printed using File Print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows you to convert the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code was created , the conversion to any other formats can begin in the tool@@ bar .
the anticip@@ ation seek the direct leap from the editor to the able position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; access files . for this , only Modern has to be al@@ igned to Settings ... tools B@@ ust .
to select the file search , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a line of source code and should be cli@@ cked on pre@@ side search . the jump to the appropriate point in the DVI ;
with this function in &amp; epi@@ ece , it is linked with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ Document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document of &amp; ile ; required &amp; c@@ ile ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; set as text editor ( settings called ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if using the fast @-@ assembly of the &amp; DVI ; viewer is not able to fix an error . if an error occurs , this will be displayed in the log@@ ging file or in the message window .
the log file extension refers to the error source in source code . in the editor , the recording file will always be used in the error . in order to view the error line , you must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ging , and aff@@ ection ; jump to the defective line .
once upon the appropriate button on the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to choose the template &apos;s option for the document . the default will be displayed :
with a selection of empty document , a document can be used either by reason or the assistant to spe@@ edy creation of a new document . further information can be included in the section .
mainly users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates can be created in &amp; ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; -@@ file can be created or create a new file . &amp; ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template .
when creating a new document , using a file , some character strings can be replaced by other data ( such as name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in settings ... settings are set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know what strings are replaced by what variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ S@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering the document class . typically , they are used as the following : \ \ &apos; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ S@@ ONS CON@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to creating a template is the use of the wi@@ z@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created , the following steps has been completed :
when creating a new document , the own template can then be selected instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . if a simple way to create a template should be searched after one on the internet and the steps described below .
&amp; ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers and herr@@ ing up of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for rent &amp; Kate ; can be made out of the menu .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to learn his loving kindness , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; ile ; can you start reading the chapter of Work with the Editor from &amp; Kate ;
&amp; ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command re@@ ference which can be called for the menu La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains an extension description for almost all commands that can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can be used as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with pushed str@@ g button to file the &amp; tex . meaning it means to select \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos;
when pulling the text , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons , the parts of the source texts can be used in the editor window .
&amp; ile ; has the ability to bro@@ wse the different types of source texts and produce them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also mathematical form@@ ul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many wi@@ z@@ ard can be imagin@@ able . it is a dedicated type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu view goes to the next or last jump stamp . thereby , this jump stamp is emphas@@ ized , so that it will automatically give you the first input of a character .
the work is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; ile ; though &amp; Kate ; already excellent words have been installed in &amp; ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under editing are the following commands for the text selection includes :
if a complete unit consists of ( group of lines containing on both sides a blank line ) . this extended meaning does not include a text , such as tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of source texts . this means that the resolution is separated by two empty lines .
normally the word is under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also an extended meaning as this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a ring spread ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to let &apos;s say a part of the document can also be removed and through dr@@ un@@ ing the button . &amp; Kate ; provides the keys of this button . &amp; ile ; provides with own commands this for faster convenience . under Edit , the following commands are included in the text of the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a ship@@ ments in &amp; ha@@ ste ; is included in the description of machining policies .
it has already been clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; ile ; for further orders under Edit environment for a simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , at the beginning of the current environment , ( no matter where the current location is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to open the environment .
with this command , at the end of the current environment , the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to shut down the surroundings .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ \ &apos; s { environment } , will be performed at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when typ@@ ing many sp@@ ik@@ ed surrounding commands , it can be lost quickly to the general view . this command closed the last big environment so that the sp@@ ik@@ ed environment structure will not be demolished .
&amp; ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups which are determined by bra@@ ckets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that comply with the work environment .
with this command , at the beginning of the current group , ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the consecr@@ ated bracket .
with this command , at the end of the current group , ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the shred@@ ded cl@@ amp .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex . -@@ group # is bound to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many welded groups @-@ bra@@ ckets can be lost quickly to the general view . this command closed the last full group , so that the sp@@ ik@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple suits are used as slide rules . for the purpose @-@ purpose implementation , the character is used . also , for the purpose of the application , the character is &quot; used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic entry for double controls can be set up under the K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X .
it can also be used to include specific settings ( e.g. , French or French ) , and thus German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when shifting from Shift ; input axes &amp; ile ; a smart t@@ line breaks . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. line er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , there is not only a line winding , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close to the tables &amp; ile &amp; ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close line breaks off .
even better - &amp; ile ; it is intelligent enough to under@@ score pre@@ fabri@@ cated &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments to under@@ score . these can be added below settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users have to arrange the columns in tables , and all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; ile ; seeks to be able to have an unforgettable tab@@ ulator . although this tab is not able to be able to add &amp; ile ; some inter@@ space for the columns are added to the current tab .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code offers , this was added to &amp; ile ; in order to have special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are available for automatic adjustment . all these modes are available for automatic adjustment of settings . all these modes are able to set up various modes of settings ... compare .
when you start a new environment with the command \ \ any { vicinity } is &amp; ile , automatically add to the command \ \ in { neighbourhood } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when locking the ring , the last character of the input will be removed and ad@@ ver@@ sely gr@@ asp@@ ed . on the other hand , the list may also shr@@ ink by entering a further letters .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . the descriptions will be punched by selection of a command . alternatively , a simply jump to these positions is possible to spray ap@@ points of nuts , and that need to be attached to the necessary parameters .

the command mode is not possible for completion of environments , and it will always be entered a few letters with a \ \ \ &apos; s call . on the other hand , environments should be used so often that &amp; ile ; provides a specific mode for compar@@ ing environments .
when calling the comprehen@@ sion mode , the menu is automatically established and it will be updated automatically , and it will appear \ \ . after that , the environment will be continued on sim@@ pl@@ est way and will be termin@@ ated through Dr@@ illing of the input .
after this is completed , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; ile , recognizes that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command is included .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; even potentially have little to do . this way , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can now benefit from the additional functionality now and build up . the plug @-@ in can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used . more information can be found below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start with the menu plug@@ ins . the following dialog can be opened :
this dialogue enables to manage all plug@@ ins contained and adding new plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage place is used &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search of plug@@ ins .
often work on a project several persons in a type hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the declaration of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features -@@ dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as Sub@@ project Manager .
the user can look out from the list of Team Members who it is . this happens by looking for the team member from the list and pressing the s@@ me@@ ar button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ name and attitude of your identity are important regarding messages and notes . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to team leaders if something specific happens . see for further information .
event actions that are executed if something specific in the project happens . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later , how much any one gets involved , or the sending of a message when a file is secured when it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
at the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project settings dialog can be created , processed and deleted .
an e @-@ mail is sent to the address given in the recei@@ vers list . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see In , wo@@ i can be set up such leaders .
remarks are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
insert notes is simple . it can be selected either the note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
comments can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , whose nick@@ name is the assigned nick@@ name of the team member , is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Head of Sub@@ project leaders should lead to the respective area or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below .
top names and roll@@ ers names are independent of large or small numbers , but spaces around the bra@@ ckets and : make the note invali@@ d .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ att@@ ing languages , D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ no@@ stic is and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
settings are available via the Settings menu . here are only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings are treated , a brief description for others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by settings of Qu@@ anta ... This dialogue extends over some pages that will be treated with one another .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , regarding tags including motor @-@ integration can be changed , so the entries are :
large / Small files from tags : large / lower case of automatically added tags . normal large / small scale means , the tags will be inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
large / Small files of attributes : large / lower case of automatically added attribute . normal large / small scale means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if attached , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this is immediately after the &amp; gt ; included .
optional tags automatically include : as above all , for all other tags , with the exception of the simple tags .
starting and end @-@ up day automatically update : when switched on , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of accent : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated signs in the appropriate coding during the typ@@ ing .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es available to identify different types of files . using the Standard Pro@@ files , the standard settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other ways than with file open @-@ open files ( where the coding of the file can be negotiated ) , but this setting is out of the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : select D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . but this setting is out of the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ um lus ; creates a regular backup copies , so that in case of a power cut or crash when next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as store the file . even for the stored documents , a backup is made regularly , according to the set time created .
the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the editing area or a separate view ( or documentation in a cardboard box ) , what makes it possible to look the documentation , the preview and the source code simultaneously .
set the window settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface have passed through change of M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on the view@@ point . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning messages is given to the taxes of the possibility to un@@ lock the display of war@@ nings by no more questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the syn@@ cing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source view in shared mode .
here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail .
in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure with the mouse button .
in the structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , which will be opened automatically , and how deep in a change of structure tree is to be opened , and empty groups are the empty sections in the text , while empty groups are found in which no element was found in the current document .
the area for fixed abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) which will be un@@ folded in terms of extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP . this means there can be a valid Group for PHP , in which the if@@ by abbrevi@@ ation something else than in a group is valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript .
here , the plug @-@ ins can be administ@@ rated . plug@@ ins are part @-@ applications from third page , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , on the most well @-@ known &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; . if a plug @-@ in needs to be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information will be delivered to the plug @-@ in when starting , so it can open the current file , the respective folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in the &quot; Only @-@ read &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is rejected . only read @-@ in @-@ parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is activated , then testing &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the plug @-@ in is correct , even if the plug @-@ in at the moment is not available , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the d@@ b@@ g deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as the support for the d@@ b@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plug@@ in concept was implemented , which enables various implem@@ ent@@ ations of plug@@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , which includes support for the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; included .
the use of the de@@ ug@@ gers for a project begins with the option of a suitable Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options , next to the de@@ bug plug@@ in box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a deb@@ ug@@ ger is activated , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface :
one view , in which the content of supervised variables is displayed . appears normally in the left dock .
a view , in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appear in the lower Do@@ ck .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bug is shown . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
depending on the supported functions of the deb@@ ug@@ gers , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bug , if necessary , manufactured , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , on de@@ bug requirements . this action is executed by default , that a project will be used , so that the normal case must not be considered .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug session Star@@ ts the meeting . close the link to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ates the basis of the sounds .
send an HTTP request to the server to manage a Deb@@ ug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to watch the current document . this request will be displayed in the debut of the deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
demonstrates the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script and the relevant line is constantly going on . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution is continued , the script will start with the requirement .
demonstrates the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script , without information to super@@ vis@@ ing variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution phase begins once a request is made .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next instruction in the script , without going into the functions or includes .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next instruction in the script , with what if possible in functions and features .
demonstrates the deb@@ ug@@ ger to move the directive and go to the next so as if it does not exist .
opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression may be entered , which should be monitored . the super@@ vis@@ ing value appears in the variation view .
with this dialogue , a variable can be entered , or a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale , like this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find on htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt to &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus to your needs , and how you can help &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to become better .
document type E@@ diti@@ er@@ Package ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; skills such as cars conc@@ el@@ ves and scripts ; for their simplicity and flexibility makes using &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and CSS . day folders contain two file types , the tag and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c . day folders include two file types ( above the edit window ) , the text and instructions quickly add to a document than a user could ever add .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be made manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see details for conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bars . short , a &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ r@@ c . file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP itself . tool@@ bars enable the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP itself . tool@@ bars allow fast inser@@ ting tags in a document without any risk of writing .
day folders are nothing like folder . you only contain the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder apply the name of descri@@ b@@ able language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the day XML and declare if it is necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better viewing and more information about working with them .
the following chapter describes every element in detail . all possibilities and borders are made in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can be found only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type over itself .
type of tags is a script @-@ function . when used is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( family 2 only )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 only )
it is only valid for the Type Method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to each other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element element .
describes a attribute of a tag . this element can only be used for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a merely @-@ element @-@ type element .
speci@@ fies the source code for attributes in the tag editor dialog , and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an inter@@ section and a method@@ ology . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day group@@ ed into the elements of a list . it can only occur to an attribute @-@ description only once . it is an element @-@ element element element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attributes of a tag within one dialog . this day can only happen for every attribute in a dialog only once ( for example for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may appear within the defined tags . this element is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that end one day . this element is an only element type .
all day XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces are affecting nothing , but watch out &amp; lt &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; must be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the day XML files , the tools dialog can start in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . select another dialog , whose simple instructions is to follow .
this feature is currently not yet available . currently , review only takes place with the load of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schem@@ atics . the file name for this day XML file is to be schem@@ a.@@ d .
in the following an example of a working family 2 day XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP will be described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is supposed to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; status &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as quite simple and there is a editor that can be arranged via D@@ TD ( selectable &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a selection &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; should be prepared for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; should be created with following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = uses 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; version 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
a action can define actions with actions ... created . Click new action to the same dialogue :
the key@@ note added to this action . with clicking on the user defined a button @-@ short@@ cut can be allocated ; with K@@ one the current keyboard short@@ cut is removable .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and in execution of the action , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see example below .
this is the most powerful action @-@ type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that may change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; even if the rapid start -@@ dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EP@@ s .
first the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to find the % scri@@ pt@@ dir variable in the command line , as sh % scri@@ pt@@ dir / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file , file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if run by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control the P@@ ID number ; this is used if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the enum@@ er@@ ated methods , a script input is provided by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default settings . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected field of document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is normally useful only with this setting .
in accordance with the input , the output of the executed application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types of issue : regular Issu@@ e , on the default output ; error messages should be specified , which will be specified on the default output , by selecting the value of the selection box :
if there are lots of tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group . in a given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and configure actions . select settings .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new Action rat@@ chet at the lower end of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add it to the matching tool bar .
complete everything and if the tag has Attri@@ butes and you plan their use , enable dialogue &quot; Day to call &quot; if available so that a input at using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a bad symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this icon ? we replace it before we have difficulties .
for creating a symbol that the action is better represented we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic further programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select edit size .
please note that the created icon does not only help you realize what does the action does , but also to all the other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green , usually as loose , star@@ ring , further interpreted ) , or should be sign@@ alized , clicking this symbol is set ; start@@ up ; -@@ tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired promotion . in addition to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder , in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue on with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , functions for tool bar or it should be shared this for a better overview by some separ@@ ator into multiple groups . open the tool@@ bars dialog on the tool@@ bar . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( left above ) for my tool bar . after the selection of the element , which will be added to tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to tool@@ bar .
I would like to add a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how separ@@ ator support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button the opposite of the start @-@ button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by trying all the symbols to make sure everything works .
back in the correct folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be im@@ bal , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool bar ( s ) will be loaded ( if a file is opened from the appropriate type ) .
perhaps the menti@@ oning expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language that you prefer to like . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document Tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Rep@@ os@@ itory whether any one has done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we will need to give you the first part of it , we will treat the second part here .
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = 0.@@ Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 4.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 4.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 4.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 4.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ ,@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 1 = $ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ s.@@ html @-@ 2 = tag@@ s.@@ html @-@ 3 = tag@@ s.@@ html .
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the document tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 , # G@@ etting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = &quot; age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
notice the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub @-@ folder on the tree with its own content ( except due to reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to one file ( and consequently , at the upper end of the construction view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
spaces are affecting nothing , but watch out &amp; lt &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resour@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ op will be replaced .
the table of contents is the area of do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed on the frame of context and pressing of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help would display the documentation directly . there are only two types of entries here : the cont@@ ex@@ tual list ( Cont@@ am@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separate part context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; this is the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can simply save your file do@@ cr@@ c / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / etc / qu@@ anta / directory / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / directory / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / etc / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / etc / qu@@ anta / qu@@ anta / share / job documentation .
if you are sure that these are good and worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation was used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ repository for the use by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to be proud of the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ating resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners , or else to whom at different places will send an email package , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , with email tool@@ bar , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts in the scrip@@ ture tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , users can download it and only be made available if our team needs them as properly and used for the release , why it requires a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . that will ensure the source of resources guaranteed for our team as well as for later users .
when you upload your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can pass a button in the dialog New resource ( URL @-@ preview can remain empty ) and click the upload of OK .
upload the upload D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) menus , upload and upload files and folders in the templates and scripts in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by exam@@ ining the integrity and the significance . in case of problems , it may be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is provided and the resource is correct , a message appears with the declaration of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not yet supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . however , the creation can be created but time consuming because hundreds of day files might be needed in day XML format . there is easier way to convert D@@ TD to a D@@ T@@ EP package automatically .
the conversion can be started by D@@ TD Download and Conver@@ ting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD , which is to be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target detection name : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Cre@@ ation line : the string that will appear in the DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion to &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , which can be adapted to the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this opportunity .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand this and understand full benefit from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , you must first tell them about these fundamental concepts . this chapter seeks to teach them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; little use .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project projects . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global items are available for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; util@@ ised , are available . by tool@@ bars over actions it is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to each in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements provide a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; designs up to tool@@ bars with particular actions aimed specifically for the files of a particular project . simply , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder &apos;s folder and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quantitative trade ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the construction views , the boxes with info and the tool bars . please check in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the boxes with the right mouse button to obtain a cont@@ ex@@ tual menu with the current documentation , such as close to the current , other or all ant@@ enn@@ il@@ on@@ ites , re @-@ charge or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or version of CVS repos@@ it@@ ters on the current document .
right @-@ click in the Edit@@ or@@ area lead to another context menu regarding the working document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the text under the mouse po@@ inter or open the file , when the string is specified under the mouse po@@ inter .
at the top end of the editor there are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; quant@@ um lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars will be shown . in the course of further development of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; if you want to insert into your document , then click on the data for this just one day . if you want to insert the data for this just one day , you should fill in a dialog box of various fields .
the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable to navigate in the information about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate them and pass through . in the presentation with cardboard boxes are available for files , project , sample templates , documentation , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool that presents &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus . this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using rectangular mouse click . actions such as adding , remove , up@@ loading , or delete the files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu .
another possibility of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole site &amp; etc . there are all options open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context it is used . the category depends on &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; working range . global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the respective users and templates in projects . more to templates are available .
here you can find information about the available Script language . the concept of integration in global , local and project works too . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information to a script . via the right mouse button you can start further functions , such as the script , to edit or send an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ right of an element the cur@@ sor will be placed on the position of the element . by the right @-@ click of a element a list of commands in relation to navigation and views of the tree is opening .
this tree appears among other construction views . with it can change man@@ rapidly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . this allows the content @-@ directed set system allows the change of all available attributes with a few cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . it can be downloaded documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the quantitative site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , two flash@@ lights at the lower end of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the news window and the problem window .
this cart@@ on display shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for example , the D@@ TD &apos;s current document and all modifications to the D@@ TD is displayed .
this cart@@ on display shows all mistakes in the check @-@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are expanded and easy to understand . show it on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the web page on the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus is the ability to send a tool bar with email . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool bar in an e @-@ mail , they can backup this in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; as any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . in order to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting up &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 am folder . also you should ensure that is no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before your bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus started to deal with a obvious idea : what would be , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , a self @-@ exp@@ and@@ able Mark@@ up languages would be ? well , this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus now ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus should be ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim has to be held that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; development community is based on why did someone else develop ? thanks to the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ report not only this is possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; thus to expand how they need it for their needs .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to enhance the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . thanks to the program Kom@@ i , they can be filled and quant@@ ap@@ lus . by the program comp@@ utation , they can be asked with no scrip@@ ting language . ( more about this can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L file and produced a commercial program .

a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not on it , with the oldest entry .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check in the section above templates . should you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template &apos;s template , only a mistake is reported .
conver@@ ts the special characters in the cli@@ p@@ board there , conver@@ ts special characters to &amp; HTML ; tags , so they are displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; files , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first line for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
switches to the block selection . allows you to select text blocks with the Help of the &amp; Shift ; now select .
directly to a line number . this is very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
searching for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bug fixes .
rec@@ ali@@ - and Swit@@ ching off the problem rep@@ orters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main reporter is activated once you change to Stru@@ c@@ tural .
displays the tool@@ bars on the left from the main window . this column allows you to set the book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear together with entries previous or nearest , depending on the position of cur@@ sors in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu , after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens a existing project of hard drive . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with the file .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presented a dialog for inser@@ ting files to the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows to copy any graphic files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
att@@ itudes , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , administered by the project . in chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you find the details .
invites a project tool bar . these are stored in Project You / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by settings . the tool@@ bars will be saved via tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to store the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool bar from the visible range . it does not del@@ etes it from hard drive . if you have not yet stored the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu option opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
download one &amp; D@@ TD ; you or someone else made and convert into the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own coating format .
load / notice the discharge from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; to renew it without the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this is a globally fixed and write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , fails to store the store .
this menu includes a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu menu in the tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current day setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent set of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inclu@@ sions means that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus is ref@@ using if this day does not contra@@ dict the rules on this site .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins can be listed under the menu items listed above . click on . click a activated plug @-@ ins disabled .
choose the syntax mode for the current file . the list of available schem@@ atics depends on your personal ; -@@ Version .
select the type of line @-@ line identification . very useful if you know people know the other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document on select &amp; D@@ TD ; the external application is tidy .
immediate shift between the different types of the user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching over time may need time or in@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card box mode , which is also the default setting , or the lower window mode , which is the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
additionally , this menu includes an entry for each open window . with selection of a single agreement , the corresponding key window is activated .
sh@@ uts the status bar on the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main hearing on or off .
changes in this dialogue inst@@ alls any application which use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web brows@@ ers .
edit the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you find details .
a dialog appears , in which you can delete records from the tool@@ bars , or add what can change .
this should produce an help in the context of the maus@@ oleum , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , since e.g. after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project , later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features can be adjusted later .
here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when typ@@ ed , name is completed automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( eg . foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you &apos;ll find the server address of the machine you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log are used . depending on the machine &apos;s setting , an adaptation may be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard .
this is the file where the tool@@ bars will be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from local fil@@ esystem to the project . several files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have to download and change static web content you want to download and change . in ser@@ ver@@ ted scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently .
def@@ aults to if files are located somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started ane@@ w on the project , you will not stop .
with this option , all files and folders will appear within the folder &apos;s folder and you can make a precise choice after credits .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . one can select the desired files by hook , or by removing the skins , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the latest monitor of the new project assistant contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be instantly upload or instantly upload the Project Properties Tab &quot; Project Properties in the sub@@ window profile or using the key @-@ short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings are described in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder is possible ) that will be ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
suppl@@ ementary option to the above , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded on the opening of the project , can be read more about projections .
this can be selected by the deb@@ ug@@ ger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plug@@ in can be adjusted with the button options . in this case , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting is described .
in the bottom @-@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a construction view for the content of the server for each profile , displaying a specific building view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , processed or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration , you can add event actions and add these actions to change or delete these actions . event actions are executed if a certain event will appear before , like the backing of a file . see in details .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior is currently not able to influence .
to open another project , select Project ... from the menu project or the icon Project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , closed , the project file is automatically stored . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files will happen if you load a new project .
the project view provides free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders are likewise , however , the entries must be opened and open with ... in with the right mouse @-@ click menu pop@@ up menu :
here various profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information on the site of the uploaded file . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removing .
the password will keep in the core memory and forgot your program . this possibility is useful when common up@@ loading of files is required and the rather un@@ secured password will not be stored on the record -@@ option .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog , if you need to change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ loading profiles can be created and to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . editing or creating a profile is displayed this dialog :
this is the server name that should be copied to files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for high charge . the list depends on version of &amp; K@@ DE and installed Ki@@ o Sla@@ ves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . usually this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port .
depending on your Ang@@ ular shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it to your discretion . the password will be stored on the plate , so that it can not be read easily , but everyone with programm@@ ers can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in a project , i.e. by simply di@@ pping of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened on the project or the project tool bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows adap@@ ting &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own mode .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; best on the menu tool@@ bars . use and adding it . adding tool bars will be treated at the adding of tool@@ bars below .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set up either using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool bar ) , which can be set up with the new action , tool@@ bar can ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog , where can be visible in the dialog on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool bar , you will additionally remove the entries and processed action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the action on them can set up in the menu with the Settings tool ... and set settings .
templates are basically document reduced , code sni@@ p and files to link . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a standard file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or any existing directory available in the template @-@ tree . templates have in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you need to submit to the file system .
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for use . please read the conditions listed in the beginning of any template when using .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents by lin@@ king ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples be found in the template tree under global templates . further information on templates are available .
documents can be created by any text @-@ document . based on these templates , new documents can be created . it makes a simple sc@@ aff@@ st for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template @-@ tree below global templates . see for more information about Tem@@ plates .
this type of templates is useful , if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template but the same text area always available in documents , with a comment via a complete menu system on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl . some examples of the template can be found under global templates . see for more information about templates .
as the name says , these templates are intended for all websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be arranged in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed @-@ tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ iti@@ oned .
create a document structure according to ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book , etc ; ) and select File as template Store as local template ...
once this has happened , notice that ( even if it has been saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the repository . look at the template tree under project planning .
select text in your document and click on file as template . alternatively , you can save the selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with drawing and installation on the tree @-@ view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy only into a template file . it can only be used for any file management functions , such as drawing and dismant@@ ling , or insert about the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a file tree or in the project files tree view on a folder to the right and secure site template . by default , the project file is secured , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project projects enable a very targeted procedure . you can set head@@ lines and foot@@ er , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; shape , files insert or link with them . in addition , you can keep some things while using templates in projects very profound .
the template @-@ structure in the sub@@ window layout is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates .
to determine the behavior of a folder , click the template &apos;s level with the right mouse button and select the context menu features . the following dialog appears :
a select field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded , as soon as the attributes of the attributes .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able unless it would be explicitly activated . in case of normal folder , the B@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder .
allows you or submit text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines to equi@@ p a full presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er .
in addition , select the context menu ( to show the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection to add folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; and source editor , which can be reached via the menu view . the first mode replaces the editing window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it downloads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor will appear . then you can edit , and if necessary , to the source code editor , in which the implemented changes in the V@@ PL ; Editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that contains &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ en@@ oid of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly as the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ous mode is enabled . with pressing F@@ 9 this mode is already active , this mode is already active to the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , where the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta .... It can be set between synchron@@ isation based on a click or automatically . in general , the recommendation can be set automatically . basically , the recommendation is : a small pot for fast hosts and a big cover for slow PC .
assuming that you want to change the title of the website , so you can select the documentation of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; the document Properties dialog can also be called as soon as a new document uses the V@@ PL ; it is used to change the Dutch code . so you can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added through pressing the two buttons below or removed . a Click on the list allows the modification of the content , e.g. key words on the column names and keyword Turn@@ key 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser . one can add CSS rules on the list or delete it . a change on the list is exactly as possible with met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to wrap a external CSS style template by selecting on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of cur@@ sors is like in a word processing , due to moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is pec@@ uli@@ ar . text can be added by typ@@ ing and be deleted by pressing or removal .
inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via the tool@@ bars , such as in the source editor . it is noted that the inser@@ tion of tags is not removed beforehand , if an anchor day , comp@@ art@@ ed with text , must be removed each other surrounding anchor day .
some tool tools such as tables assistant or lists assistant are disabled . they are later used in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will work in this release should be used to tables or lists tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; a tool for the investigation of style settings . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ li@@ stic devices , search for certain elements is possible and the style of style can be followed .
to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ ile , except &amp; K@@ DE ; still use lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt libraries , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already available at a typical installation of &amp; K@@ DE ;

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ ing . so why &amp; b &amp; diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes , and at the same time corrected many places . another programm@@ ers had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in mer@@ ging .
the program was used by me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly was changed within that lines . and there was no evidence in the places where maybe only the mon@@ oc@@ re had changed . that mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences in line and changes in white signs . later , any number of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare it quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the compar@@ ative window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ known file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful if two people operate independently of each other on a piece of co and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to edit and display the original file . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . this screen photo shows three qu@@ ell files on mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you to the same and merge sub@@ folder . this image photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder combination :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and suggests the possibilities of current color monitors . if you frequently need to check Ko@@ de , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines vary only in a certain number of white signs , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the left hand side . ( no off@@ ence more if any one changes the loss . )
when a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ .
if all files are the same name , but in different folders , you can simpli@@ fy your typ@@ ing work by writing only the file names of the first file . example :
calibr@@ 3 folder folder with folder 3 folder , folder 3 folder , folder 3 folder , folder 3 folder and folder 3
the opening dialog allows manual setting of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection about the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last open file from the list . the opening dialog can specify your selection and shows them next time . if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences is performed with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the default and mer@@ ging of folders will be used for B and C , but then use a folder , then use &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging crosses , the input field is active for target and allows to edit . however , it is not necessarily necessary to establish an output file immediately . you can also do this step further with the store .
the setting button opens a dialog with settings . here you can define options before you start with the same / mer@@ ging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog , you don &apos;t need to select any files , you can simply connect the dialog by using the button .
you can also use drag and shut@@ down : simply draw a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains some similar functions . if you need to figure out how much these features are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would have to download and then compare these relevant files . now , you can simply copy the relevant sections , then compare and then compare .
note : you can &apos;t find out anything from &amp; diff@@ 3 ; pull out only the f@@ allen@@ ger of text in a compar@@ ative window .
warning : some editors will interpre@@ t the pulling and insert text into another program as out@@ crop and insert ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such a case your original data may be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional ) . ( if the path becomes a file too long , let the mouse have a while over the line . then a small aux@@ iliary window will show the full name . )
the three source rounds are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed over the settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , one sees on the color , which differs from it . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merge ) .
left alongside the text is the summary column . when differences were found , the column displays the appropriate color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it &apos;s useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases relevant . )
the vertical line , which separates the combination column from the text , is interrupted to the places where the source file is activated . if the line is activated , the line is illustrated on broken lines .
the result window ( below the compar@@ ative version ) also has a info line with the inscription issue : the file name and &#91; Ge@@ modi@@ c &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ connected , the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to move the smallest deleted / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
when only two compar@@ isons are used , each distinction must be solved at the same time as a conflict .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the first line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed , where the start of the group is otherwise not visible . ) This group is then highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with the colour back@@ color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam .
sometimes the automatic merge or manual operators are left no further line more in the group ; then there is only one plac@@ eholder for the event that you will change your opinion , and perhaps again select another source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you might want to copy and insert .
the text &amp; lt ; Con@@ tra @-@ execution phase ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy any text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : when selecting the sources check the options to ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
this will navigate mainly with the images and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard , right , down , down , side down , from the beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ early and C@@ tr@@ l end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ si@@ can column can also be used by clicking on the navigation system .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with insert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ load mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of the each group ( as already described in the section ) and the editing window is explained ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / initial / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture / Str@@ g @-@ up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture back@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflict also after the manual trigger as a conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
in order to copy the marking in the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insert ) . if this option is activated , it will automatically copy automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board and modify the manual copy . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
c@@ eil@@ ing are stored according to the underlying operating system . UNIX @-@ based systems use a plug @-@ in line \ \ r \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and list of the last used files will be saved automatically and re @-@ manufactured using the next start . ( click Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides writings with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . )
when you enable this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ic script . if the chosen writing does not support this presentation , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be sc@@ anned . in these systems , the kno@@ bs will automatically generate an odd color .
when this option is activated , the tab@@ ulator button will be inserted into the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , an tab character will be inserted .
when you press entering or return , the back@@ wards of the line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is activated , any option is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual is then subject to the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection of the operating system used .
when using files tries &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all complete identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . in this step white signs will not be ignored . even when mer@@ ging , white signs will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car @-@ pull cord &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , other again save only one line @-@ in diameter &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; however , if this option is enabled , wag@@ ging signs are visible , but like a white character will be disabled . however , in default , this option is de@@ activated .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored in the result but they are treated as white signs .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are described as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sively search for smaller differences , the option is activated in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow at very large files .
in automatic restart mode , this setting determines how long the result of the choice is displayed before the subsequent conflict will continue .
dis@@ solves automatic all conflicts in white signs by selecting the chosen file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) It is useful when white signs are in many files as well . if you are only concerned the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning and se@@ duce con@@ jun@@ ctions . see for details under documentation for the directory and mer@@ ging after .
if a file is stored and an older version exists , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix . original depends . if there is such a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original , it is deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . the changes in this option does not affect the current running program . you have to finish &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set up globally through the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you use this option , the top setting is used for all entries .
in the select fields for the coding , a short note appears , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this imp@@ lies how special characters are treated and re@@ interpre@@ t . since the encoding is individually adjustable for each file , files can be compared to different coding and can be merged .
once you have edited a file , you can define what encoding is to be used to store .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the processing commands can only handle with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can define the coding of the output of processing commands .
switch off this to supp@@ ress causes of changes in white signs in the text or over@@ sight . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may see only the differences between two of three files . by selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to normal and a second over@@ si@@ ce column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . simply click the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
orders side windows next to each other or above each other . this can also be useful to display long lines . ( this option is available in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide un@@ expect@@ edly to bring files together . a simple click starts to merge the merge and use the file name of the last source file as pre@@ defined name for output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last updated file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command first . in &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which is precisely to cut any distur@@ bing parts or correct the rec@@ ir@@ ation .
when reading a file it is given first to this external command , the command of command is given ( see above ) , then the output of command is used only in line of command . you can only write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds to your requirements . each input line must have an appropriate edition line .
the idea behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when setting up the Di@@ ff @-@ results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program itself . the good news is , however , that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this template assignment # \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
using the same pattern of $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experim@@ enting with you , you may start to understand it and maybe you like this regular expressions . you are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing line for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ ili@@ . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hits , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , so quasi .
sometimes you might want to perform several targets at one time . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sounds from each other . example :
instead of sed , you can also use some other such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ E &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ gies at per@@ l some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for displaying and merge . however , the further operations change only the data that the line @-@ like algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor uses the output of normal Pre@@ processor .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or hidden differences , you cannot notice certain differences , and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programm@@ ers need to edit a lot of files . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; b diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ cur@@ sive and merge .
... makes a suggestion for each item to merge ; you can adjust the proposal prior to start
... can sim@@ ulate the interaction and shows the sim@@ ulated changes , without going to perform it ,
... take selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of individual files . you just need to open files on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders will be merged , the folder will be used as a base . if no target folder is specified , use &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start , not to merge . in order to run the merge , you must press the respective menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
while reading the folder you provide a little news window over the current progress . if you break the scan of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then .
if the scan of the folder is complete , shows &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list of List@@ ings with the results on the left , ...
each file and any folder which was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded . you can double @-@ click on the + / - click on the object or double by clicking on the object or by folding the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu includes two functions , all sub@@ directories , with which you can open all folders .
when double @-@ click on a file , the file &apos;s comparison is started and it appears on a comparison window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane at the selected object . in such a case the mer@@ ging action is not automatically selected . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as seen in the above image , the A / B / C is used in the columns red , green , yellow and black .
with identical entries the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders will be considered as the same as all of all content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders , the age is irrelevant to its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes .
... a and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... a and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( for example , if A folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting data types exist . as long as such defective objects can &apos;t be started .
... A and B not have the same type of file ( for example , if A folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types exist . as long as such defective objects can &apos;t be started .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active when only two folders and no explic@@ it targets were given , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders will be identical . if for one entry ...
... a and B , however , are not identical : mer@@ ging and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for issu@@ ing file only B ; directly after the merge copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
if two folders will be activated and select the option new file instead of mer@@ ging ( uncertain ) then the date of files and suggests that the files are different , but the date is identical . files are different , but the date is identical .. sol@@ os such errors can not be eliminated , then the folders can not be started .
while the merge will run a file after the other . it &apos;s status column displays Fer@@ tig , if the merge has been successful , and according to other reports if something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final review and see if the status is al@@ right everywhere .
if set in the setup dialog the file @-@ compar@@ ative Analysis is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these include the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either perform the selected entry ( file or o@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you have chosen all merge action ( even in all sub@@ folders ) you can start mer@@ ging .
note : if you do not have a target file , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode C , it is used as the target , when two @-@ folder merge is chosen as target and using syn@@ cing A and / or B as target .
if you select a target file , please check if all entries must be displayed in the target group , even in the folder structure . there are several options to be ski@@ pped through certain entries , check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to add all entries : select directories to continue / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to put together only the current entry , select the actual element or press F@@ 6 .
if there are still invali@@ d file types still invali@@ d actions , a message appears on the err@@ one@@ ous elements . you may then select a valid action for them .
when you perform all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options passing , sim@@ ulate and ab@@ rupt .
select sim@@ ulating if you want to see what would happen , without the really changes , you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; in diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual operation is necessary ( assemble a single file ) , then a mer@@ ging panel is opening ( see screen photo ) .
if you are ready with a file , select playback to start / continue , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then , then continues &amp; drop @-@ diff@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error you &apos;ll see a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some errors that can help you to select the cause of the problem . thus , you have the option to select another promotion for the entry or solve the problem in any way before you continue with the merge .
if some entries were individually passed , notice &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; this entries ( in the current session ) and will not lead them at the later date . even if this merge result has been done or not stored , these entries will be done than done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files displayed on the specified pattern will be displayed in the elementary tree . several samples can be entered with a Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; the valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not comply with this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the Element@@ tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the Element@@ tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ignored files that are also ignored by CVS . many autonomous produced files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . the file system marks a previous point . this option lets you decide if these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on default .
with links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to the links displayed . this is disabled in default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated like normal folder and recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not r@@ ushes for possible loop loop and crash@@ es ; ) This option is switched off in default .
performs a complete analysis of any file and shows the Statistics columns . ( the number dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files that contain any text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare big folders through a slow network , it may possibly be able to compare only change date and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain degree of security . please be careful with caution .
similar to confidenti@@ ality of alter@@ ations . there is no real comparison instead . the files are regarded as the same as large . this can be useful if when copying the alter@@ ations date . please be careful with caution . this option is enabled in default settings .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode if two folders are compared and no target file is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging so selected that both folders will be identical . also the results from mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is posted in default settings .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file will be proposed as promotion . ( this will be considered in@@ secure , because the other file has not been changed too . ) This option is available in default settings .
if a file or a folder will be replaced , or delete the original version with the .@@ original extension already exists , this will be deleted without additional backup . that applies even the normal interaction of individual files , not only the combination of individual folders . this option is enabled in default settings .
normally the file @-@ merge view is visible to the mer@@ ging of individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want that , you can turn off the window of the directory &amp; Text window , and turn off the main window of the window menu between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply via double @-@ click . yet , there is also a single file also directly joining the folder , without only store the folder . if you store the result , the status is settled in and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder .
this status is lost , however , if you read the directory again : directory menu : new entry
K@@ DE supports network transparent with help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote locations .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on the FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a ZIP archives with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relatively . or .. contain . it is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . there is a brief list of limitations :
or it can not be distinguished if a link shows a file or a folder . then it will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no possibility to process per@@ missions or change of change . hence do the per@@ missions or change date of the original . ( note the option confidenti@@ ality of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files ) .
the main purpose is currently as a differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 requires two complete inputs . however , if it is used as a box , it takes &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files will exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program starts to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch program and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that if there is no one of the original files . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or the compar@@ isons of folders will not be supported in the part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is Com@@ pare ) already . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 demonstrates that it can be merged like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs very long and have learned a lot by finding other programs in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or go so .
you might have compiled the program from sources and configure the configure PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE . in the default , configure / usr / local but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are first described as the same ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is not treated as not as the same . i@@ F similar lines of next to Each other , this R@@ is , but this is more often the case .
the editor does not notice for any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends . this important information is required , however , if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to design an additional file format that could save this information .
the effort has so far too large . you can always restore a certain version of selecting a source A / B / C . to process large quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly changed ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; it appeared , and the text can &apos;t be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to emphas@@ ize differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this purpose .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
information about how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
you can find a list of the latest changes under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir is the folder inside your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should still occur difficulties , please report on &amp; K@@ DE and mailing lists .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or reverse @-@ wire ) in the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current selection .
only differences are shown : files are identical in all folders that are not listed in the folder , therefore not in the target group .
( in the current program version you need to update on these options to the folder with the function Update . )
there are only entries shown that these differences have to be copied . if the target file does not contain these files , if the target file does not contain these files , it is likely to be changed after a later program version . ) This option is likely to be switched off .
note the buttons to choose from the source with inscription A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the appropriate window is attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) , they will be removed accordingly to the button on the button .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ p@@ aces in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a preview of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite convenient to see the current programs on the working areas to end her size , to end her or move it . this works both within a desktop and in several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ areas as well as to display applications . applications can be selected and even moving on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible within a desktop as well as on other work@@ spaces .
the cont@@ ex@@ tual menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when on the empty back@@ drop of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , click , the context menu only displays the two entries P@@ ager ... and end . if , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , click here the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries to minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , Desktop and end . commands are following the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window onto the full size of desktop . appears only if it was cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when it cli@@ cks on an application .
if this check box is marked , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager window can be moved with the middle mouse button on desktop and other working areas .
when this field is crossed , are displayed in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work areas are displayed .
crossing this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of the virtual work areas . it is shown together with name , the names are fitted with ordin@@ ator numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background is displayed as a background at the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty work@@ areas will appear to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays easy rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the actual program panel . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classic lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to appear ; in a 2x@@ n grid , it shows all virtual working surfaces in some horizontal and per@@ pen@@ dic@@ ular in a vertical range , which is very good for the view on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ atures in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can display in size , display Windows as symbols or with their contents . moreover , it runs outside the control bar .
Click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; followed by selecting the switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
currently this can not be changed in the dialog settings , but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not need any write permission for the file , you must enter the key win@@ dow@@ banner mode and specify a value . possible values are :
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic package .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen size . you can enlarge with &amp; k@@ mag , a part of the screen size . this application is interesting for different users . this application includes artists , web designers and people with a visually imp@@ aired reading . this documentation is supposed to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag , is a very powerful application which is constantly expanding by new features . it is optimised for use on high @-@ performance machines .
if you start &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as above . the main window of the screen is displayed . in the following , this window is called the magni@@ fying window . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is described in the follow@@ ings as a selection window .
in the default settings the range increases ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter is like a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to illustr@@ ate a select screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
do you want to avoid the mouse po@@ inter in the enlarged window , select the mouse po@@ inter . please note that it is not able to recognize the form of the mouse pointing device . this is always the standard @-@ K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse option .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrows and mouse button and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture the content of the magni@@ fying glass and move it with the arrow buttons .
if you add the &amp; SH@@ IFT key , press or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can shift the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to insert into a file to insert into other applications ( in order to insert it later in other applications ) , turning the picture and much more .
starts or stops the updating of the display , which causes the necessary CPU time to be 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , low , medium , high quality , very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window is displayed . the selected section is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your introduced short commands to store files , opening a new window , printing , needle ( with the button document again un@@ loading in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and los@@ ers &amp; etc .
may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen saver . you can use a range of screen so as if you use a micro@@ scope to view the small printed in a paper or photo . this application is used for various people of benefits : from research che@@ ers or artists to the web@@ designer or visually imp@@ aired .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( type either this URL in the address bar of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or launch k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .
&amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; was developed by O@@ laf Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ midt @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are Sar@@ ang @ us@@ ers@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster For@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , emul@@ ates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse po@@ uring a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate the repet@@ itive strain In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) Syndrome and which every mou@@ sec@@ lick may em@@ ulate pain . however , this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , can handle the pain that causes the mouse to use without pain . unfortunately , you can also get pain without any pain . unfortunately , you suffer pain that are related to your computer using the use of your computer , if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool may avoid pain , which are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that are caused by moving the mouse , us@@ eless . and , as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be differenti@@ ated for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you break the movement briefly .
if the intelligent shift is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it &apos;s pushing the mouse button . in this way , you can start pulling the mouse button . in this way , you can start pulling on the mouse button . it requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this delay time must be pet@@ ri@@ dden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , a mouse click .
if Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es shift is enabled , the rotation of shifts ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is stopped , the m@@ ous@@ se pool , after which the mouse button is waiting , before it takes place the mouse button .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now the click by mouse shift . is this function activated , followed by a break , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . this movements will be started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; K@@ DE ; to reduce the reaction time . open to the Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there Sound System and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ p@@ eg@@ ler sound buffer , which you can set to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; starting with every start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently only available under &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of G@@ NO@@ ME or other window settings , please drag the specific documentation to find out how to launch there a program automatically .
set all settings back on the values , which were set when opening the dialog . already , you already pressed the button on the button , the settings will be reset , on the stand , after the final pressing of application .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first of all with the default settings . in particular , you should first switch to intelligent sc@@ ars first . then , if you are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the automatic mouse click , you will later increase the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that doesn &apos;t represent a link . therefore , you can park the mouse on such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ eted , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually pretty easy . the trick is doing it &apos;s not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse becomes different . however , it should be quickly clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . dirt and dirt can be easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or the finger@@ nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are just a shift operation , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool appears ; the operation no longer can end through letting the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , using another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists that you even run a mouse click . by this , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , set back and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; c@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , continue to execute mouse cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there , where you want to place it . but use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you don &apos;t want to make a touch of mouse cli@@ cks . safe zones for the mouse po@@ uring are &amp; eg ; the grey surfaces to make the tool@@ bars and the title bar from windows .
I &apos;m trying to work with smart moving , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the intelligent shift is a more advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you want to b@@ ypass it into the cli@@ p@@ board or want to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board or want to move it into the mouse button . but there will probably not be any problems with the mouse button . here are some advice :
use the intelligent sc@@ ars not if you &apos;re just starting to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . mark the text instead of a mouse click and hold the change @-@ up key , while you move the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text , and again click the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . it will play any time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . the mouse button lets you play a mouse click . later you can use the smart sc@@ ars without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it needs some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , to be able to use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window ; this should be the case for most systems .
the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is only available if the system has a sound@@ card and speakers , and it is set correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button then worked as soon as the mouse po@@ uring is short . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and to which the stun@@ ned pain@@ s is made pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , can also be set as recon@@ figured that a pulling process begins , before the mouse button is started . in this way , the bricks can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that can talk to the dum@@ b users to speak their computer .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; m@@ ute users can speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the interview sentences , which should be spoken once again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen photo ) , enter the command that later is used for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog@@ s .
on the second page , select the standard text@@ book text@@ book . you can often choose text passages without having to type . the text pass@@ ages can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right screen photo ) you determine the word documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can compare the word lists with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the same reas@@ oning .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth is intenti@@ onal and contains basically a input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ing of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a running memory of the already spoken movements ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; correct setup , you can enter the pro@@ positions you want to listen . each spoken proposition is app@@ ended to the exp@@ iry memory . you can select from it pro@@ positions that should be spoken once again .
with the Settings menu En@@ mouth ; set up ... open the dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialogue contains two flash@@ cards , speech output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ an and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field , enter the command panel . in the selection box below the input field , place the character encoding , with the text on the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two kinds to pass the text , select the check box if the text is unchanged as standard input on the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be given as parameters . you can use the following space holder :
of course , the command to voice output from your language generator . you will find this command in documentation to your language generator . examples of this option will be found in app@@ endi@@ x .
using the dict@@ ability as language service is used &amp; k@@ mouth ; as first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings are available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is available and which is currently used in SV@@ N . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key tag or by selecting a text passage in the menu text kit book or in the lending for text@@ books text@@ books .
with the selection of So@@ on , the chosen text passage is inserted directly and additionally added to the flow @-@ memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is initially only entered into the input field .
in the second select box , you can determine if the text@@ book book will be stored automatically when closing the editing window .
store the book stored . if you select changes , the text@@ book book will not be stored . select Before Save , will be stored &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book book will be stored .
the page number@@ ing contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word support . in the main window , next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the previous dictionary to choose Wor@@ ter@@ restrial .
by buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries , or export the order of books , or export them into a file . below the list you can choose the name and select the language for the dictionary .
choose from this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the occurr@@ ence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available sp@@ ell check dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these can be weigh@@ ted .
this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly set words are written automatically in the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary during the time .
the main scope of the window on the editing of text@@ books text@@ books is two @-@ divided . in the upper part , the text@@ books are displayed as tree structure .
in the bottom part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding key code . if you select a text@@ book item , you can only change its name .
actions such as new text pass@@ ages or books add or select text passages and books , you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar , or via a fol@@ dable menu .
the sequence of text pass@@ age@@ books or text passages can change by drag along with the mouse to the new spot or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key change .
the selected text is cut out and copied into cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used if the selected areas of the default .
the selected text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used if the selected areas of the default .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the default .
if this menu entry is attached , a different tool bar is indicated by buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is provided by default over the menu bar directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the sha@@ ved left side and drawing , the tool bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is attached is a narrow strip in the bottom part of the main window with indication via the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is out@@ dated , a post@@ p@@ able bar for text@@ books can be arranged directly under the tool bar . by mouse click on the sha@@ ved left side and drawing , the tool bar can be moved to another location .
you probably have the instruction for the speech output not properly or not fully entered . open the Settings link ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for speech output on the card output issue . ( see setup dialog for voice @-@ by @-@ speaking voice to further details . )
Festival is a language edition of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are supported . license allows to use festival for free and spread without restrictions .
to show an example of command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that the Festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written generator system . currently , he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the institution &apos;s installation , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ eri@@ ff folder . the speech output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option has to send data as default entry . ( this is the recommended example of application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ em@@ es to MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la are installed .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax menti@@ ons the last character of the text , so an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / / mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data will be switched on .
the voice dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ further language service , which provides a standard interface for speech output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various speech output systems .
as the setup of the language can only be done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use dict@@ at@@ ts@@ d as a language service to &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
um &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can &apos;t talk to have text through the calcul@@ ator . a list of pro@@ filing sentences can be saved , which the user can always spend new spending .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language synthes@@ izer included . on the computer , a voice synthes@@ izer must be installed .

for the first start of t@@ k@@ night or as long as no speaker is set up , the card speaker is indicated . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card will appear . see .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ izer offer various languages and voices , such as various male or female , or those who are able to set up in volume or speed . you can also set several variants for synthes@@ izer . it should be able to set up a speaker if you use &amp; kt@@ ts , as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher would otherwise use the standard loud@@ speakers .
various speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printers for the same printer .
when you click on the cardboard card speaker in kt@@ u , the speaker card speaker is also displayed . this is also automatically displayed if you start a kt@@ ops and is not a speaker .
all inci@@ dents appear on this list appear in this list . the preferred speaker is on top in the list . the top spokes@@ man is used for speech output if an application is no spokes@@ man .
select a copy of the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to remove the spokes@@ man from the list .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a row on the list . the order of speaker in the list determines their priority .
in order to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ on button , click on the button .
choose one type of tuning , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girl @-@ mate to choose from .
when you click here , it appears on the new spokes@@ man on the card speaker . to change the settings of this microphone , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; already almost no use . go back to the box map and check if speech output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) in order to read and manage text file . Click on the map board orders to create text records and manage to manage text entries . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language output system by &amp; K@@ DE . Click on the flash@@ card reader to open this card card . here you can adjust some general options .
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this start the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text records and read text orders . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the TS @-@ System of &amp; K@@ DE ; de@@ activated .
when dict@@ ated is finished , continues &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , unless the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if the check box is marked and t@@ k@@ sm@@ s automatically appears in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the previous reading is complete .
with buttons in this series you can start text records , stop , stop and restart .
with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; cli@@ p@@ board order or read a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
Click on Application or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the map board orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the box type and run voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE , you can read the text of the displayed website . then mark the text that will be read before , and select the main menu tools lyrics . after a short time the voice output should start .
it is almost always sense to mark the desired text of a website . you can ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML , pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ er and other invisible brands are also read in advance .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE , you can read the text message first . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that should read before , and select the main menu tools lyrics . then , the language edition should start .

filter for drawing string en@@ forcement offer a good way to correct and correct ; it is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b out of the messages sent by mail , and also the phr@@ ase / local / In@@ box , as it can be assumed for most cases . read also .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ops ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before being sent to the tool @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful to improve the pron@@ unci@@ ation in order to select false words or abbrevi@@ ations , to obtain a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid any short@@ com@@ ings of language courses and their voices .
to understand the understanding of fil@@ tering it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and holds these orders . if the issue of screen reader is pre @-@ read , orders received will continue again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the issue of warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message left normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read the messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website you can read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; somebody welcome to enter the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ messages are also news .
the rest are simple text@@ books . any order that you encounter from the card ordering is a text job . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that are used in text records . text entries are intended for the edition of longer texts that have no particular credit card .
all four orders are processed in qu@@ eue , with the exception of the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if a application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this issue is stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , news and text entries as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; messages .
filters work the text and give it to the next filter . at the moment , there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters .
character string replacement parts of a text by other text . the resulting parts can be delivered either as words or regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with pre @-@ defined character chain filter ( e.g. : - ) by text or for re@@ form@@ att@@ ing messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . in the scope of delivery &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation by &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaker profiles , you can depend on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set up a female voice on the card speaker , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . read more about this .
each of these different filter has a adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter determines its rules , he does not apply the text to the next filter .
if a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; - Not@@ ification of &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent by all activated filters , which were installed on the page below . editing through the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the specified normal filter . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be processed from top to bottom .
Click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will display the dialog@@ s below .
for the setup of character strings , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as compar@@ ative sample . if this pattern is found in text , the text will be exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . large and lower case is not considered in comparison .
specify a name for your filters . this name allows you to choose from the name of the other filter .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column alignment and replaced it in accordance with the drawing string from the column . the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
Click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word , or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can download a list of words or regular expressions out of a file , store the current list , or delete a list of a file , entries are attached to the existing list .
if here is a language registered , the filter is only applied if the speaker is written for the text assignment one of the language registered languages . Click on the button to select a list of languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key to the mouse click .
if a value is registered here , the filter is only applied if the text is from one of the specified applications . you can type several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID run program will receive you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must be om@@ itted . if you have an example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 has to be copied only .
the string quartet filter is applied only to the text if all conditions with one entry in the box can apply filters if match . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the string is used regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by part@@ itions ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will not find detailed instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package am@@ big@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ating &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such formations . but it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is achie@@ vable over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the female speaker system , you can send texts at a given speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . you can specify , for example , text by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops , there is a text to the filter , there is a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is sent from the speaker features which refer to the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . with the spokesperson on board speaker , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is registered here , the filter is applied , if the text contains the specified regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; click on the button to obtain help from entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor off the regular expression at the beginning of string chain , i.e. , start the regular expression using &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the characteristics of the desired filter conditions here . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker is chosen to see the desired requirements of the test . Click on the button to the right to preview the dialogue selection menu selection .
use these buttons to store or upload , load , or delete all settings .
the speaker system is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with one entry in the box Di@@ esen filters if applicable . you must apply at least one condition .
the speech output API , by &amp; K@@ DE , with the programmer to give your applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD using the language synthes@@ izer , so that it may use this synthes@@ izer .
the following section includes a brief description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Bus ; interface of the speech output API from &amp; K@@ DE ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for language services via the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; K@@ DE ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .

none of the mentioned language synthes@@ izer support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have installed the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; the per@@ formers is set up , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone to install S@@ able at all . if you don &apos;t have to use this voice to read websites , please ensure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or inter@@ section characters seem to cause mistakes in synthes@@ izer , so that whole pro@@ positions can be ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ wi@@ h . what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure that the option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , this may be fixed by using a string ch@@ un@@ lock filter . see .

the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , please refer to the description of synthes@@ izer into the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ops , according to information that are not yet included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ tive module architecture for language synthes@@ izer . if you are &amp; kt@@ ts , you would like to expand your synthes@@ iz@@ ers to use the Develop@@ er team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops ; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the pack@@ ets k@@ deli@@ bs and the application files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ops ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ code , or have downloaded the tar@@ ball in current , please install and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ops , check first whether or using your speech disp@@ at@@ cher by your voice synthes@@ izer . in addition , you can use the script script ( SPD ) conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops , which is used to use the program source disp@@ at@@ cher . the program t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so that the establishment of the tool disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ rup@@ ted into single sentences . the user can return transfer or break @-@ to , repeat , stop or break the output .
if you have an application text on &amp; kt@@ ops , you can request an application of the preferred speaker for issu@@ ing . if you have a speaker set up , the language can be selected English and its sex , this will automatically be the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker is chosen you will see in .
when you click on the speaker card on adding , to add a speaker to the list or click on Edit , the card speaker unit is shown . as an example , the module for the video games will be shown . details of modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you &apos;ll need to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text which will be handed over to the festival . in general it is estimated that western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 are used to use Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust volume , speaking speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select a few controllers , and select this gray , the chosen voice will not be added to you .
some voices such as multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded due to their size several seconds . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting the K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set will be synthes@@ ized in case of higher memory consumption .
if this check box can not be selected , you still have no spokes@@ man ( or don &apos;t forget to click on users ) .
if this check box is marked , the program window t@@ anned on the program window . otherwise , after the start , only the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if the check box is marked and t@@ k@@ sm@@ s not running , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the opportunity to read or approach them .
here are all orders placed in the qu@@ eue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the precisely ordered set . speaker ID corresponds to the card ID on the card speaker .
with buttons in this series you can get a wh@@ opping in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or go back . ( but not every contract consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be taken on the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead of AL@@ SA , G@@ he@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also .
only text records are listed and administ@@ rated . expenses of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ders , War@@ nings and News will not appear . further information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if one component can not be selected , has been compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the respective audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you select AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here . see also
put the microphone speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equals about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about the double normal microphone speed . thus , this settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
Click on the to take the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ on ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules installed in your system , most of them will not work . you must find out what device works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
on this map map , you can set special actions that will always be performed if the text message is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language orders :
the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it is drawn up to all other orders . once the issue of screen reader is pre @-@ read , orders received will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . a warning stops the output of news and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message left normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read the messages . if you are &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can welcome to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome to enter the room .
will a text order interrupted by a message , warning , or issue of a Screen @-@ reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output is in the waiting line .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text job is interrupted . when the introduc@@ tory sound is active as also the introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card card are only valid for normal text entries . for messages , war@@ nings and expenses of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern there are no special actions , if this will be interrupted by a higher priority .
to read &amp; c@@ law ; note noti@@ fications of Not@@ ebook messages , start kt@@ t@@ k@@ screw and click al@@ erts . the card messages will appear .
mark this check box to switch the reading of &amp; K@@ DE ; configur@@ ing . if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no messages .
once this attitude is marked , noti@@ fications will be noti@@ fied by which a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read before .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears in which you want to select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when somebody menti@@ ons your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which in the list is nothing else specified , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . ignore .
use this selection box to establish what &amp; kt@@ ops ; do if an event arrives . you have the following selection options :
if you select user defined text , enter the text box . you can use the following space holder :
you can enter the characteristics of the desired microphone . standard choose the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if the action is specified for a specific event of a specific application , this will be executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of certain application . as the last option the promotion is scheduled for carrying out the standard ( all other events ) .
the event all noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the forward messages like this :
use the button storing to store the settings for the messages in a file . these invited events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click the delete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for the control of voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . moreover , marks for the management of pron@@ unci@@ ation from the example short@@ cuts . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ts are currently supported ; SS@@ ML only partially only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used at the SS@@ ML issue .
if the settings for speed or tone can be set in the festival configuration dialog , the SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal filter filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must start text in individual sentences . therefore , it can also be synthes@@ ized in the box , as only the first movement must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text job . thus , you can also jump back or break down and break down , even if the language synthes@@ izer cannot be supported directly .
here you see the pro@@ positi@@ onal filter filters . at the first start@@ up of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is set automatically set up as a pro@@ clamation point filter . you can change its settings or add another pro@@ positi@@ onal filter .
in the sim@@ pl@@ est way you will learn the setup of speaking selection and type text for reading . check out the speaker selection process , change some properties and check how the selection of the microphone has changed . in addition , you have to set up more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is invali@@ d .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then begin to start reading , as only the first proposition must be processed and not the whole text block which can last very long ,
you can then stop or ab@@ ort essays on the card card , even if the language izer does not support this function .
for these reasons the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal filter filter is automatically set up if you start t@@ k@@ sm@@ s for the first time . it can not be removed , only be removed . do not change anything at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
to compare the pro@@ positi@@ onal character filters , text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a table sign ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the pun@@ ctu@@ ally ( table code will be automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard transmission rate filter keeps the character set .
S@@ BD @-@ filters are never applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; messages ( k@@ Byte ) , war@@ nings , messages or output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern .
if you have removed the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal filter filters , you can add this again by charging the _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ops ;
on the card speaker Please select the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speakers ( the speaker on card speaker ) . in other words : no female speaker features are specified .
use of the matching speaker , which shows all the characteristics of an accessible microphone . if you select the settings of the microphone or edit , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker out who is the earliest set of characteristics .
select the method for input the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the select buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired microphone . if this feature doesn &apos;t play a role , don &apos;t give anything .
mark this check box if the property should have priority from other features . you can also set several markings here .
since language is a critical factor in understanding the issue is , it will always be used as priority property . the only case you may want to specify this attribute is before when you may know that a specific application text appears in another language as the result in the environment .
to use all the features in the field of spokes@@ man , which matches the default on the default , click on the select button and then use on speaker that matches the following .
in this case , 0 is written for the last text job in the qu@@ eue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the input 0 required ) .
kt@@ t@@ k@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support but I do not get tra@@ ce@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is shut down and shut down . probably you have to register G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved yet , you may install G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , you may try to update or install a G@@ ST version .
the audio output of AL@@ SA will not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I do a text job , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ops ; a message appears that says : to open PCM .
on your system , the problem exists that conflicts with AL@@ SA will occur to prevent the same time to open multiple PCM devices . references for possible solutions will be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org .
I charged an extra voice for the Internet . I installed it and can use them in the festival but kt@@ t@@ k@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice .
if you are in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / Activ@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ ices , add the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL , where you have found the voice to the developers .
on the cardboard menu audio there is a setting speed . that this works , the program SO@@ X is installed and will be able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival games feature a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the microphone speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( see that the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; based on &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .x@@ sl file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML @-@ per@@ formers , and put the speech speed up .
I don &apos;t make it to read websites with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not work . so the x@@ sl file throws the x@@ sl file to change from SS@@ ML to S@@ but the GEN@@ DER tags . the same goes for the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a string ch@@ un@@ lock filter and now I can in &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not appear anymore . orders will not appear in the cardboard box orders , the order is ordered only from a set . what am I doing wrong ?
inter@@ section mark ( point , question mark , clamation mark , comm@@ as and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for pro@@ positi@@ onal detection .
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org )
G@@ CV in the version 0.@@ 8.7 or newer . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ amp@@ amer , by calling the G@@ ST &apos; command in front of the use of G@@ ST . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
some users live in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system is also part of it , you can not play music simultaneously and start a text if you start a text job and then start another . possible solutions for this problem you will find on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ en does not support real breaks . if you do a text job in &amp; wait , the current sentence is still read yet .
the audio program SO@@ X is used for the general setting of the speech speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ X with the command apt @-@ get install SO@@ X . the program is available on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
do you have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar pressed archive ) , sign up as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into an appropriate file . change in this folder and enter the following commands :

before you use &amp; kt@@ ops , check first if your language synthes@@ izer is working correctly . follow the instructions you get with the synthes@@ izer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer whose source code is open . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help to find the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations .
this voice sets the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in early development stage . un@@ pack the software in the / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you need to set up for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a lab@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . look at the Festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be set on ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; synthes@@ izer . then festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ti@@ stic analysis and m@@ bro@@ la ; thereby creates the audio output . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; program and the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNA settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of systems and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file system has been developed to enable the users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf setting , creating a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched through a selection of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf is not able to install network hardware . physical devices and their drivers have to be able to install and configured , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is shown at all and allows setting up the network characteristics .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed with installing &amp; Linux . network devices will be added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network interface module is loaded when the network settings are selected at &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is chosen . when switching of module network settings , this system tries to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform is not recognized , the Dutch selection is offered . it &apos;s the platform from the list , which matches the distribution and release of the release . by marking the setting not @-@ again , this option is automatically pre@@ set automatically at the next start of network settings .
changing the network settings are only possible in system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed in colour mode , which means the settings can only be viewed in the system administration mode , by clicking the button system administration mode at the right bottom of module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system management mode the whole functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interface serves to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the serial network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button @-@ click interface ... in the dialog box can be set up .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking on the button Advanced Settings shows the dialog with further possibilities .
the TCP / IP Settings can be downloaded from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP address for the system will also be used with the start of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server will be required for the system . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual can be carried out without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP or TCP / IP configuration . in the IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this attitude is marked , the system initi@@ ates the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not requested , this option should not be activated .
these values are displayed in this dialog as the characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . using an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off . switching from a switched network device is accessed by selecting from the list and click interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . switch off a activated network device is accessed by selecting from the list and click interface .
speci@@ fies the IP address of the machine in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub @-@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the Gateway computer is located .
a host with DNS support is replacing a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . that is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator htt@@ p : / / www.@@ in@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS trig@@ gers this name to an IP address such as about 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the e@@ quest@@ rian name resolution allows a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed faul@@ t@@ .@@ DNS entries can be sorted by selecting a single agreement and execution on the list with buttons up or down in the priority list .
by clicking the button you click here ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will add the new nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to list name resolution , select an entry and then click on the button .... It will be displayed in the dialog box .
the list of emin@@ ent hosts describes computer @-@ to @-@ IP address instructions for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used first line with boats when no DNS servers are available . in small , completed networks , it can replace the DNS server .
normally the list includes well @-@ known calcul@@ ates some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . these can still be replaced in a test in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click on Add . the dialog New alias will be indicated .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , de kno@@ b add several times and enter other alias names .
select an entry of a well @-@ known audit@@ or from the list and select Edit .... the dialog box will edit .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK the list of the static hosts will be updated .

the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .com is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE and Q@@ t are installed .
installing the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; con@@ sole , with rpm , as follows :
alternatively , a tool with a graphical interface can be used as a package , or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and K@@ DE does not satisfy exclusively , but in addition , development packages are required with libraries and other things .
this is only recommended to users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile it . the following commands should make this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given on basic network technology , in the second will all be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files .
this area cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information is communic@@ ated on the integration of the PCs into a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . N@@ 5 has never found big dis@@ sem@@ ination . IPv6 is expected in the near future . this description is therefore focused on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is aware of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; works is the network administrator to be allocated or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be used . definitely , the IP address can not be freely chosen !
when setting up a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially @-@ reserved area to avoid IP add@@ ressing of the global ( internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , so any use of any use is possible .
of course access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks mainly addresses are used in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called Standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is needed for the IP re@@ direction .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 assigned to one &apos;s so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files , which are operated by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , are located and where they are placed in different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed at DSL connections , so it is then no surprise when in case of active DSL connections , there is a different content to find there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ cage . another stand as expected may occur .

PO@@ SI@@ X con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat , is a security program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the ability to create several archives on a tape . the first goal was to provide a surface for tar , which presented my wife : how much longer does it take if you sec@@ ures ?
before a band can be used , it must be integrated from &amp; k@@ dat . it can happen on three ways :
&amp; conc@@ dat ; cle@@ at the band back and reads the pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information of the band . recognizes &amp; conc@@ dat , the sp@@ ell on the tape do not , you will be asked if the tape should be form@@ at@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; conc@@ dat , the pre @-@ sp@@ ell , search for the appropriate index on your record . can &apos;t be found , you will be asked if the tape index is to be re@@ produced .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol appears for the tape drive to indicate that the band was integrated . in the Status Bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched for the tape .
before throwing the ban@@ anas , initially , the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to do this .
&amp; Cor@@ dat , gives a change of symbol to the band to recognise that the bond guaranteed to the band and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar . the band can now be cast out without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat , it can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted .
a band of band must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not have to form@@ at@@ ted with the form@@ att@@ ing device , it must be form@@ at@@ ted before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy tape drives are usually a form@@ att@@ ing of the tape , DA@@ T drives , on the other hand .
after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; conc@@ dat , with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all data on the tape will be lost . after finishing the form@@ att@@ ing process the tape will be automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you encounter the backup procedure , you need to select the secure files . it can happen on three ways :
select one file or folder in a local file tree . it is only stored this file or folder .
mark a profile profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in a local file tree with a bun@@ k@@ ite . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders will be secured .
with the right mouse button , click the local file tree and select the backing up ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog opens up for backup . in this dialogue , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you confirm the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
mark a file or folder in one of the archives in entry for the drive . it &apos;s just the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the files in an entry for the band with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders will be checked .
Click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry test ....
once the test procedure has started , the dialog settings for checking . in this dialogue you can check once your selection and modify the work folder for checking .
if you confirm the settings for checking , the dialog appears . this dialogue shows the progress of the trial period as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can register re@@ produce , the files must be selected , which are to be restored . this can be done on two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which include entry for the tape drive . it is only restored to select the selected file or sub@@ folder .
mark the required files from one of the archives with one block . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and choose the menu . ....
once the recovery process has started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog , you can check once your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , dialogue will re@@ produce . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band inde@@ x@@ file using the band content . this process conver@@ ts all existing In@@ dex@@ files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of tape :
here a safety profile with the straight selected files and the default settings are created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
according to the current work folder , according to the current work folder , the current work folder will be automatically updated automatically .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , that only those files are stored in the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems , can be inserted separately under backup files . each entry is tar independent from the other .
conducting an in@@ cre@@ st backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be used . only the files are secured , which have changed since then .
the file &apos;s name , which is used to determine the changes since the last in@@ cre@@ st backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files are ; and lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up your settings via the K@@ D@@ at menu ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be made :
the complete path to the device node for the tape drive ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape .
if this setting is active , transfers &amp; k@@ dat , before the tape is integrated into the drive . in some drives , this is necessary to be performed before read or write operations .
if the option is switched on , it tries &amp; be dat , to lock the throw at tape drive . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , when loos@@ ing the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the band automatically cast out . do not use this option at flo@@ ppy streaming .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; be dat ; the hard@@ war@@ y block size for the tape drive is to change . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; be dat , in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat , a band form@@ at@@ ted , writing it a file to the start of the band . this file should only prove a memory block on the band . the file &apos;s content is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The tape ID . the format of this string is host name : seconds , where computers are the complete name of the system , which the tape was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has passed since the era in which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar - archives created directly with &amp; GNU / - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not in@@ correct f@@ uses .
check the contents of a backup . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ and@@ set@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer for system protocols . the program is intended for in@@ experienced users , where you can get information on your system or where the system allows the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users to provide quick access to information on issues related to their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer does in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system inst@@ alls the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log offers users with quick access to information about problems that will appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log , therefore , tries to provide some enhanced features , using whose help the protocol files are filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a range of useful features . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included , and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions are provided with their help to easily filter and sort the single protocol @-@ rows of a protocol @-@ file . the individual options for sorting and fil@@ tering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after start@@ up &amp; ks@@ and@@ set@@ log , first the most important protocol @-@ file system - the system protocol can be started , so you don &apos;t have a small copy of the system , so you don &apos;t have a system rest@@ art@@ ing right . the protocol files are usually found in folder / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or pursuant to the filter bar . the list of the log lines will be displayed automatically , so that only log lines will display on the filter . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns contain the string of the filter search term .
you can also select another post on this site . select the string of the filter search term only with entries in the file system protocol , and enter in addition to the filter bar the name of a process , so show you &amp; ks@@ and@@ log ; all protocol lines are sent by this process or created .
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you identify the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of level error are displayed with a consp@@ ic@@ able color as a protocol @-@ lines of the stage note . the colour display of protocol @-@ lines can be switched on setup dialog .
if you want to display certain process only ( for example , in system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then be useful if you want to investigate the issue of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window , to view all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ ic ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate basement windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage an additional window , select a protocol from the menu .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website to htt@@ p : / / ks@@ and@@ log@@ .@@ forum software softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g D@@ ort you will find further information about the source code by &amp; ks@@ and@@ ular ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log , you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; K@@ DE ; version of Subversion : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ;
welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it rapidly develops to the standard for control the start @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and even more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go to historical aspects here ( since I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to set a machine on System V In@@ it without any re@@ installation and re@@ form@@ att@@ ing . the &amp; Linux ; kernel will first look under / etc after an in@@ it file . that &apos;s why you must make sure the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . there you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you want to run on the system or change to another Run@@ level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services does not include such things like set@@ serial ports , which will only be started . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should go on / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ conf / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial connection .
the kernel is searching for several places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the standard Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see the following line as the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre @-@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can repair any / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and then you can repair it out by restart the system and run the following :
but how do you start now all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry is link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : any of the scripts is written so that it is an argument like start@@ up and stop . you can actually start this scripts from hand on command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K includes , the script will stop with the argument . if it includes an S , the script will be called the argument .
some people wish to set up a simple way to build machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running server , which can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; c@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you will learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another hand device is simple to say not tri@@ vial : simply draw one entry from the area of Available system services to one of the six runners to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can shift scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by removing it somewhere else . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the area of Available system services .
note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed when you move them into a new area . in order to insert them only on a new track , you need to insert into the context menu , and insert into the target range -- even if the same entry exists earlier in the target sector .
the sorting number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must process the sorting numbers of the um@@ ber@@ ing entries before attemp@@ ting to insert the system service .
note : there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown in the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the tab button to enable the various working ranges ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection - or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another lap level , move it into cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired Run@@ level with insert ( using C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change sorting or the name of a entry manually , press the input key to change the properties dialog . use the dialog by renewal of the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . alternatively , the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) are available if they are available . otherwise , they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I &apos;ve talked with the Standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts continually . what can I do ?
enter the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to restart in single @-@ use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be fine ) .
I &apos;ve provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you have to edit additional files in / etc that are present only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution .
the way , such as system services will be launched in these distri@@ butions , it simplified the configuration of proprietary development programmes , but is not standard for the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( eg &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply without message if your configuration files are not provided or wrong .
the significance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual may be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it &apos;s sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding icon of the tool bar or entry onto the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window is made of two flash@@ cards , user and user guidance . to edit the desired users or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears in the dialog user or group features .
some flash@@ cards are only represented if you have extended system settings . only if you have enabled System@@ s@@ limitations ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a card card is generated on which you can make individual settings . additional card cards appear , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD uni@@ xen .
the card pass password will appear if shadow passwords , or for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , as in BSD columns , are installed .
this card card only appears if for at least one embedded file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , for any user parameters , the limit constra@@ ints are subject to data in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with a record restriction on the field .
the card details inform@@ s about the user &apos;s ad@@ mitt@@ ances of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , is in the field of primitive group . furthermore , users can join in other groups by mark these in the big field .
the dialog features a list includes a list of users . to add a user to the group , mark these users in the list .
to add a user or a group , select the user or group menu or click on the appropriate Add button on the tool bar . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works analog@@ ously .
with this module you can add the li@@ lo boat managers , remove , remove and change the period up to the boats of the standard operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change , change and more .
