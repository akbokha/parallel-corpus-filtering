<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated to the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not be able to check any important decisions without the translation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Just web pages can be translated. other texts should be translated directly on the Babelfish stock, where you can insert text directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & conqueror; in spite of its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & conqueror; by making this easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For further information on the use of & Conqueror; and you will find the built-in functions in the manual & conqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & Conqueror; you can setup settings. open the card card tools, and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list with standard installation modules from the KDE; add-ons. please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the package codebase, which includes & Conqueror; before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash-module, click on & Conqueror; on extras, you can view the page that brought & Conqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if available, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The addling filter (also called the folder filter) can be reached in the & Conqueror; menu bar in extras. with the module you can filter & Conqueror; 's current directory on different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To view the DOM construction supervision in & Conqueror; select Extras DOM's tree... and thus open a new window with the DOM of the document's displayed area. as default, the display begins with the root nodes of the document, example: 1 element, all other nodes are subassemblies of this root pipe.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Conqueror; displays a further view of objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative to the different toolbars and text messages to view the content of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView; consists in printed folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map. every object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the inside objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size of a file or folder is reflected in the size of a folder as the sum of size records. in this way, large files can be detected, even if they can be seen far below in the folder hierarchy. according to this, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap presentation is a rectangle, which represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles offers meaningful colours and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched from view colour mode, can either display depth for the easy detection of the checkbox or the figure of another file size, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the respective file or folder. for each feature, you can designate if there is enough space available or if the surface is provided by limitations with the sign of the Treemap. moreover, you can set the relative position of the inscription on the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Daremap for Treemaps the rule should be observed, that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView; this target will not always be able to display the merging of entries, and this framework will need place, which is then lost to the subordinated entries, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As dividing the area of a entry for the subordinated entries, the implementation will be provided. here, it is necessary for the labelling and avoidance of space loss by frame always beneficial to create spaces that are possible to splendable. the best methods of this regard are lines, columns or recursive second allocation.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can designate the minimal area for one entry over the menu entry. instead, a sample pattern is drawn into the area of the superior details, to indicate that this area is actually covered by a subordinated entry.</seg>

<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata are according to your definition data, information on or documentation of other data provided by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to argue that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you will not need to find any certain photo. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then do not use & digiate;. the base metadata is guaranteed in a database as well as in the image files, very fast search and create a secure archiving that you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and need to know before you want something in your system. your image files must somehow be arranged on your computer. you must decide if you want to save others to your computer, whether you want to store them on a network drive & etc. please note that you need to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. tourist pictures can be found quickly over your location. if you're doing enough photos, you'll be able to use subfolder like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of pictures to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% workfiles have and you will not want to reorganise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking processing easier. separate new files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are searching for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option in the site of metadata in & digiate; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently select the metadata from the database into the files by choosing the corresponding item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? for this purpose, & digiate a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should select any photo keywords, inscriptions and an evaluation. of course you can select all the images that will need the same attribute and then put the value. it makes sense when you can focus on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now take key words, key words, as you proceed with other programs frequently, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloged pictures from another source with embedded key words, then it gets & digiate; automatically add the images to the correct position within the tree is no problem, and can easily be done by pulling a subtree to another. the changed keywords will be followed by & digiate; updated while it is pursued.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows like different metadata. this is a very rough representation, since every block of metadata is found in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keyword - the next section refers to protector or comments, the third important tool to atise your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most don't want to just see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you're sure about how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. far the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider it closer, then start some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say you this is the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing is. Wow! one starts to dream associations, memories, the historical period of time is again present, you may possibly even hear the silence. the inscription has changed your perception of this panorama as completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others consider the title perhaps more important than the picture yourself can tell you. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is the meaning to the viewer, to help Him to help you understand what you understand is what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is alright when a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength to act with a labeling for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiate; you can also send a lot of text in an international alphabet (UTF-8) when labeling. you can even export it for a selection of pictures simultaneously. if you export your images in Web galleries, then you will have to tell them about your wishes for the labels and / or the title of Web-gallery.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet from Google Earth? well, because with pictures, the train rides this space already with lighting speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of geolocalization will be imminable already. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat the pictures at the recording location. you can also export the pictures at the recording location. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and designates the practice of copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the execution site of & digiate; as a information should be paid:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for actor and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo, for example, to protect the identity of the photographers, for example, the name of a company or organization can be used. if this field does not support Comma nor Semikolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author Title (Synonym for Constitution): linked with the author. this field contains the number of work of the photographer. examples of this field can be titles as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a merk to the authoring field, this field must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (Synonym for Console): use the bidding field to identify individuals who offers this photo. if the photographer has an news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations will be listed here if the picture is a bearing photo, then here the group / agency is the picture here given.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not provide protection against abuse. everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with hosts is able to delete this, in the image of embedded metadata. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in every image. & digiate; will provide such a module for the stacking processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record defect, record loss, power violations, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disinformation, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that went on the road or a fire. this kind of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we will discuss problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Croll Ontrack, the world's biggest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which had a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these cautious products must be treated, so you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer to get more difficult and much more expensive. there are offers above gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that is a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe it is in your surveying room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so it's about to choose the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to mistakes, even if you were just written only. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for the formatting and the control margins. despite this massive protection they alps them through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust, etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">There is a convenient program called IsoBuster that apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications such as damaged disks, hard drives, Flashmedia, USB drive etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs appear to capture the Formatwar against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slow with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate media. also, you should copy the media with a description, date & writer features and then on a clean, dark dry and locally protected spot. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Dismanufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers guarantee a new disc, but not the data. Google makes a big field study on the hard drives of hard drives to this topic: dismissing information</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: Disks stay at the longest when you are operated in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at lower temperature tracks, the most frequent error cause, SMART may notice this error. some of SMART adheres to imminent failure. this is especially read and relocation counter. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a power outage before you saved the files but these losses are usually possible without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">During most electric devices not much, this is different from devices containing computer chips and high-speed sprocket. these anomalies can cause these anomalies, complete data loss, hardware degradation, devastated motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against power spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is a portion of energy stores absorbed and the rest is grounded. however, it is usually available in the form of a plug-bar. however, remember that not every plug-bar contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also be careful to protect against lightening the protection against lightening.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since a transformer is able to use any cables at your computer, you should pay attention to all peripherals that are connected to your system. some manufacturers are also able to provide a phone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specifically designed for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for on the road.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctuations in power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a few seconds can result in loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection against overlashings, these tools automatically provide rechargeable battery power. if you are allowing you to save your data and run the system, you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. in addition, the life time of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security for electricity problems with the cost of avoidance of this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer protects you with it. finally, you should always remember all the cables before you go into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use this as drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google shared storage is a further popular offer to store any data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only effective against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. that's why it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo-Community 23hq.com provide online storage services available on photos stored on photos. the professional version provides you more at your disposal, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, Web solutions are very secure. data transfer errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the great companies is included in the offer a backup and a subdivided memory. so they are Desasterproof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are prone to transfer errors. the file system zfs and btrfs ensure at least the data integrates between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that no one says if a transmission error occurred, not when it was destroyed in your hardware. it's quite worried that there is no protection for your computer. no one seems ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more secure data than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable network parts are another source of transfers, since they create interferences within the data streams. at normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transferring problems, you should look into the future. thousands of mistakes can be seen in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems appears to be one of two candidates who can handle turntables on low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one to GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope it's available soon for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its brace file system. this is still in Alpha-Status. it uses the same protection mechanisms the zfs and is also available for & Linux; but it's not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in notebook and 46% for worktop systems. notebooks now amounts to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most people think. it is currently limited to Microsoft systems such as theft, or new installations; and it is currently only limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS are minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corruption data and data loss: wrong, just the speed of the examining process during an operation is higher and a defined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 Blendencies of fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and noise characterization for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of the 10 megapiary sensors. even if this resolution is even too high for compact cameras and the end result is ideal for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a 10-12 megapixel resolution. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk can be found today for 100 & euro; so make sure your data is affected by a data loss. therefore, make your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make something dangerous like the reinstalling of your operating system, the exchange of disks, or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. do planes exist: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect an entire room or whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Hence, desasterative flexion always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs into your neighbor, your office or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a more common reason for a data loss despite safeguarding the panic. if you have a backup not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files should be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two points: one of the complete safeguarding and the final differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incredible backup: a backup of files have been changed since the last backup. created several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time. this backup comes up with a versioning system on the next with the exception that it has only been tagged and not continually running.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool you can easily setup your machines. in contrast to the script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer Scripts rsync only the difference of files that really changed. this happens and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optics medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the end, you will come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment for at least one month and a moment you should manually happen after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time period you really interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be respected:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unforeseeable because of nature, everything is said to be careful with caution and re-rate during the time. unfortunately, there are no other possibility to get backwards compatible. all 5-8 years you should ask oneself like the current system is backward. the less variants you have in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered with explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that's important to reading your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have installed the scalability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. on * nix systems such as & Linux, you can copy this range and put it on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was recognized by the system, but do not hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC / SDC # source is / dev / SDC & dollars; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBgt; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day is no more software you can read, then you can create it yourself. this task is simpler from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG is designed as an open source standard for GIF. but it is much more. it's loss-free, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, but not as many as TIFF uses and a slow compression level. this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. TIFF can store in uncompressed form or in a container with a low-loss compression of compression (deflate). a problem is, however, that this format has been adapted to many people. there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open rough aspect ratio, designed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use metadata. a handful camore manufacturer, DNG is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is perhaps one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe its XML-based XMP technology has introduced to replace the & quot; image resource block & quot; a mix of XML and RDF. it is a characteristic of XML and RDF. the file information are stored in a file itself. the file information is stored for XML / RDF; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers move it before an original of your recording, mostly in the rough format, where it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can reconsider any problems with the link between the metadatric file and the image file. therefore, you should consider if you use DNG as a container and put everything together there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadatenstards, which includes a large range of application purposes and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarifying efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadatenstards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">For example, import pictures from the camera, card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures are on the camera head, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save these in your Rorechiv. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a hostile processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the pictures again with & digiate; then you should add the metadata again. these were cut under any circumstances from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital watermark. export them only then in Webgaleries, add in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiate; in paragraph adding a photos to an album, you'll find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to importing photos to your Albendadata bank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiate; connect these with the calculator, turn the camera to the display mode, and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it is possible to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a hefty indicator appears at the lower end and the capture pictures of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not show images for file association settings. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol indicates the file association for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information on each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of a updated or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information, which can be logged from the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer. note that with some digital cameras did not get all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer data, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of & digiate; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button, and then download the photos from their camera to a single album in & digif;. at downloading the photos are not deleted or we recommend you to verify that the pictures are secure in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the settings selected using the standard selection methods of & KDE. once you select the photos, select the button download and then select selected. the knob is selected until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is available now. these pictures have been downloaded from & digiate. in this case the new pictures have been selected with a star in front window. if you select this option, you will of course download the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you use buttons all download or selected files, select a dialogue with which you can select the target album. you can read the list of existing albums, like normal folder. select the list of folder on the list. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you select the target album, press OK, and & digiate; downloads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all at once, simply delete the button free. if you just want to delete a few, you need to delete it first and delete the delete selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possibility of deleted photos that you deleted from the camera. therefore, the photos will not be checked in the trash of & KDE; they should be carefully checked, if you want to delete it from the camera. if you want to complete the camera arithmetic, you should do this over the camera to make it faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as file names for the photos are often not particularly expressive names. this can be used again after the photos taken from the camera. this can be useful if you upload photos of different recording sets in the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and spear of the image and date-based underground. if you use this latter option, a file will be created automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during the transfer opens three more options that will be performed before the photos stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF fields in the IPTC-field. with the latest option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish a different file format as the standard format, you can add the prefix photo% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. please add the option to the date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name, you will have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or in case of capital letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, used & digiate; used for a photo, is displayed below the name, which makes the camera available in preview. their settings will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiate; can use any information about the orientation of the camera for time recording, to perform an automatic rotation during the sign. not all cameras make this information ready. in the section of the page a metadata you can find more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera does not deliver these information, the photo is in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn off, use the button Advanced and select the automatic shift in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera is made information about the date where the photo was made, can be used & digiate; these subalbums are based on the image data. all images with the same date are loaded in the same script. not all cameras are available in the same script. in the section sidebar meta-data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case stores & digiate; the photos directly on the target album. if you want to change this option, you will need to add this option and select the disk-based subset at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from their hosts to your camera is the button download. then select File Transfer dialog & KDE; you can select the file extensions that will be uploaded. you can also choose more than one file with the Standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digiate; you, where the images are to be loaded up. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select the desired file and press OK to start the upload. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as general term in this document. this is a position that can be displayed in longitude and latitude and that can be displayed on a map. the identification of data can be carried out by the American GPS, Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place. not everyone uses an aircraft to cartographs an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forget later, where exactly the photo was done, you can open a browser with a click to locate the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digigif; users want to locate the site of the photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is well to enrich the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as the data into these fields? there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, via a reworking of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical assignment (manual) and last about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera which has integrated a GPS unit. but there is a few that work with GPS receivers. either as card module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save those data in the GPX format, as this is the only format supported by the module to geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from images and from GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and width of latitude or other data, you can use this script which works with the Exiftool by Phil Harvey. it uses the predefined coordinates to be created by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com will show no European street types. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, all of the navigation details for Europe are showing.</seg>

<seg id="286">Autocitel is a synonym for the editor: this field should contain the identification number of photographers. these can be names like e.g. arranged photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description on the car field, this must be filled also.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for suppliers: use this field to work the photo. this does not have to be the author, if this is a photo agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here, then the group or agency will be available for the picture here.</seg>

<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color you can select it here. you can switch the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture. these colours are specified here. in picture editing, this screen mode can be switched with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">The Chroma-Subject is meant that images are coded in a higher resolution of luminance and colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia to the higher explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">Using the PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG is a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can add this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF-files option, you can adjust the Deflate -compression-compression extension for TIFF-images. this reduces the size of the TIFF-images. it does not affect the image quality, as the deflate algorithms are loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">Having lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you were able to lose the loss of loss, the relation between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digiate, picture-working was only a photo-viewer for photographs. currently, it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard value is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light. if you use this option with odd lines in the output. if you use this option with a minimal loss of details. this option records this issue with a minimal loss of details. this option marks the image a little soft, eliminated but the 2x2 wizpattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance is used in the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white is not set off. standard is a fixed colour balance, which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors, using the second sensors, this effect will get more details in four steps. for other cameras, this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top lights, so the parts of your images are indifferent, due to the inability of your camera to catch a penetrating white in the settings. in addition, you can solve some unusual results, since it shows the spikes in various rosaries. last, you can attempt to reconstruct some of the missing information from the shlichter.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast filled as green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares of the still unfilled blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how many color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the option, you get the option to set a level. here's a value of three a compromise and can be adapted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminant value to your taste. you probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1. but this may also be made later in the image options of & digiate; to keep the time for the demo-invoicing, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo application algorithm is a digital picture process to obtain a complete picture from the particle data that will come from the color filtered image sensor, which have many cameras and which are known as CFA-interpolation or color-construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiate; and Dniw provide you three alternatives to you: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests, it was created. however, it creates color action against the edges. Bilinear is interesting, if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour variance of your lenses you can set the red and blue proofreading values here. this is certainly the best method for a graining correction because you will be carried out during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions like this again. there are also LCMS and & digiate; information about colour space over a colour space to translate the colors as precisely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions, if an image in the image processing is opened / color administration module with raw files.</seg>

<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profile you have the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can change when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Color Gallery View is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are color-managed not the whole screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be done to the camera plate and model you are using. not all profiles are produced on the same kind. there are some, such as Canon, which no color tone mapping or gammadcorrection. currently, dcrab gamma does not apply to conversions at 16 bits. this means that you must perform the tone mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft-Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your photo print from a device again. this is very useful before you print image, as your printer has a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated, rather than leaving the blind algorithms of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it's quite obvious what colour profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not in the Canon's models. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles to fit together. this answer is naturally unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion can be seen in the style for the objective: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image plug-in interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of & KDE; picture viewer and image processing is supported; many modules support, which are written to cooperate with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select which you want to use, and these are then loaded by & digiate; these modules appear as new entries in the main window and in addition, you will also see some of the contextual menu pops.</seg>

<seg id="338">The image processing includes a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of these are available as modules in & digiate; therefore, you are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you will find in the section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom edge of the window, the file name, current date number, magnifying factor, and the current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the upper edge, including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions of photo editing edit your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you use File Save or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have stored the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might need a copy of your image before you change it. you can save with file stores.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved, you can restore the original image by using the menu file, restore the button to restore the image editing in the toolbar. you will then lose any change that you have been performed on the photo since last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of educational work can be reversed or restored. the last action you can sort, by selecting editing and re-manufactured using editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should do the key abbreviation, Ctrl; -z for the back and Ctrl; -change-Z to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press a moment in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a contextual menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all the actions between also reprocessed and restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same headword by using the navigation buttons in the tool bar, image high, image down or the entries in the menu file. if you have any changes on the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter in the photo and zoom out in that you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the Ansichts menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in toolbar: enlargement factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen view shows the photo in full screen mode. you will normally be able to change the toolbar. normally, if you do not wish to change this on the installation dialog by & digiate; then you can call this from the & digiate; watch this section to set the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print it in the menu file and get the Standard & KDE; press dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print single pictures or whole sentences. entire image pages can be printed out of your selection. you just need to select the images with the standard methods and from the menu album Export device. if you follow the wizard you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiate; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which is available to important information and actions for selected pictures, also available in picture processing. it will be displayed if one of the five riders are clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple-click on the same rider will appear or disappear again in the rim.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can insert labels with unlimited size or insert. note the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields that you can use by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut down and special characters are formed. if you want to use the IPTC-labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you comments on, use either the button application or change simply for the next image, the inscriptions are then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the appliction button, there is a button more. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also put the metadata to the files. however, this is always done when you select a metadata settings that are always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section evaluation shows a score rating of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the top bar or with the keyboard abbreviation Ctrl + 0... 5. the evaluation from the sidebar is always used to evaluate more pictures at the same time, select this context and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The key view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the sample-tree and a selection box with the previously in this & digiate; session fixed stitch.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is dynamically adapted to the given search phrase. you can quickly limit the number of possibilities by searching for a byword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further relief when typing the sample at a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, these settings will be saved for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keyword can also be set by marking the respective check boxes in the tree. all keywords: image files are stored in the IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view, select a keyword in the sample-tree, this only will be applied to the upscale image and not on the entire selection, if you want to choose a selection with a keyword, please read the section keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the main window displayed. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and addicts. if additionally, one or more sample filters from the right side will be used, only the chives of these two are displayed. all set keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and lay down. suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view, you can easily drag them out of the right side bar and put it on the selection. as a result, a dialog appears that you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the sample filter is selected on no keywords. they were drawn with Ctrl + a and afterwards the keyword substituted from the right head tree to the selection and put it off. a dialog asks whether this keyword is supposed to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes takes place in any start of the program. you can also be switched on the settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and you have created and realize that it should be or should be a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry to be found in the database. this may be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define a Advanced search over all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button. the options then look like this:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you use a colour-administered workflow is the colors that of your camera or scanner can reach a predictable variations of which in fact you can print out the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner at the same time that you print or publish the colors back from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject is on color administration, everybody wants to know which buttons it is necessary for the results that he wants. unfortunately, this tutorial will give you sufficient background information about colour Administration. additionally, you should make links with deeper information enabling you to obtain your own informed decisions to make you the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow is fulfilled every six below, then you don't have to worry about colour administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB-colour gamut. (further information click below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other photo editions are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and make life for all so simple, why should one use another colour space and thus would you have to worry about color pacifng?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufex-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour space, so please visit Bruce Lindbloom excellent site and then click on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calibrate my monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in the RGB-color space or not, you'll need to calibrate your monitor, since it's RGB of your monitor. if you are working as a color space of sRGB, then you must either use your monitor to the sRGB-standard, a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections giving one image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting to try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The features normalize, abstained, automation and contrast expires from the menu Correct automatic correction automatically try to make the best of your colours. you will have to experiment with these effects, to see which works best on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize the leukaemia values above the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as light as possible without its color shady. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Comparing: this method uses the illuminant factor in the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity can be used as flat as possible. sometimes, the result is very good results in improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes it is also only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracle with a painting or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the colour range in the rot-, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust the rot-, green and blue channels on the entire history of history.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast Increased: this method improves the contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of a picture through the postpone of the lowest and highest values on the maximum possible range and a new jibs of all values in between. this is only visible at balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The bald-slip of & digiate; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white waste of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is somewhat limited because of an colour space with 8-bit color space. if you can also be too far from the original picture, areas with overflow occur. if you are working the white like in the mode, your possibilities will be better to correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balancing extension of the copyright protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu entry to the white picture of the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The front window can be adjusted in size. on the left, the original image can be seen as well. the preview can be dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original whitish like, then click on the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red markers. the Luminance of the pipics under this marker is shown as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above, a histogram is indicated that once you have changed a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well illuminated images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three shades or your sum will be displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow Adjustment allows you to improve or dimming the shadows of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">Starting with the aforementioned checks, you should use the colour temperature-pipette. press on this button and after that you can use the color temperature to calculate the color temperature of the white monitor. this type will also set the temperature and Green Values.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally you can set the white off with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overload indicator will increase the colors, if more than a colour channel of the Pipe is overexposed. you will get the combined result in the white balance. this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and load do exactly this. each setting of the white comparisons you have set can be saved in a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Button default settings uses all the filter values back to their standard values and the respective neutral white comparisons. note that even neutral settings will be given another photo than your original. if you store them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set here the decoding depth per colour channel of the processed picture. 8-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. this coding also requires more turntables, computing time and also stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as the editing of raw materials. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tone mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the helligaments. a detailed manual for the use of color profiles can be taken to rate.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under color tonic correction. this tool presents an integrated way to adjust the same mistakes and allow you to use them for several photos. this is useful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistakes and you always need the same correction. in the manual for toning correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to gradation, that you will find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiate; tool color effects provides you four colour effects, a solar effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a cantline filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was created an effect when using a partial flash light and subsequently inverted the development of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas were inverted from the second lighting. this result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar thermal system. in approx. 50% intensity, the image shows the picture which is chemically possible. a further increase is made, finally a negative picture is that not to produce Fotopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effect. the original image is the (1) and the revised intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filters simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easily, he embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an illustrated color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot, and therefore a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvias powerful colors are also made by some photographers, especially those who have little landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light to the contrast edges. the parameter Levels controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon. in big pictures the filter can equip the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual you want to fix the color contra and the brightness of the photos. all your settings can be seen in the preview. once you are satisfied with the score, use the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you have a photo of poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation can be able to increase it instead. all changes you can carry out in the preview if you like the result you can confirm the changes with ook.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple Leukstarch / contrast / Gamma, the tool reads sound value correction for improvement of exposure. even if the dialog to this tool appears very complicated, you only need the area of slider. more concrete the three slider below the history program.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked into the inside and to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the operation is to postpone the knob and make sure how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview can be dynamic, updated on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted whether the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis is displayed. in pictures the large areas of a constant color is dominated by the linear histogram of a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top for the dark tones, the middle for bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones, often called Gammaier.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinets can be used in the preview of the original image, in order to adjust the input of the shadows, medium and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers enable the output values to interactively with the input values. the compression of output values can be used, for example, to create a diversified image as background to create while something else is foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, images are automatically set in dependence on the values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: with these buttons, the set values are stored in the file system and later reloaded. the Gimp level is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using this mode and the three color pipettes, the input will automatically re-adjusted for all shadows, means and suntones. please click the preview of the original image to set the input of the histogram for rotation, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overload device controls all color channels to indicate overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. here it is a indicator, i.e. you will get the effect only in the preview and it's not a effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the adjustments of inputs applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the preview can be dynamically updated on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiziere Channel: this box box allows the channel to indicate the channel changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures featuring a digital camera, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode allows the logarithmic mode.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move an arrow to the right, for example, the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright tones are corresponding with dark expressions and that are corresponding to the corresponding picture-pixel darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to change this marker on the curve that will change the original value, create a point on this line and move it on and off, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve can be created with this file system and later can be loaded. the file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three dpipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sun tones. enable the color pipette to use you and click on the original picture to put control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overload device controls all color channels to indicate overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel superior pixels, you get the combined result. here it is a indicator, i.e. you will get the effect only in the preview and it's not a effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white picture which was corrected in the Luminanzduct. shadow and teens was applied using the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digiate; image processing is a tool to improve the channel channels, or change the shadows of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix colour shades of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">You can select the colour for the histogram: this gives you a first hint to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window displays you a preview of. the original can be considered as a comparison of your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target picture features a red markers. if you positioning this in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: control for red, green and construction allow you to adjust this channels even if you also activate the respective color component. this is particularly convenient if you are also using monochrome, since the channel mixer is then used to generate great black-and conversions of your photo. try the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a colour is to a visible roughum which occur naturally in colour channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel. if that is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the farmyths first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any mixer-setting can be saved to later and download. that used file format is the Gimp-mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overload device controls all color channels to indicate overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. here it is a indicator, i.e. you will get the effect only in the preview and it's not a effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re-adjusted. the Luminance option is activated. the original image is below (1) and the painted picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction ability. with the development of digital photography, black / white one step, since color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film rolls profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford delta 100, Ilford delta 400, Ilford Bridge 400 Pro 3200, Ilford-4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good at all scenarios and fits especially well-portraits in the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange linter filter. this improves landscape, maritime scenes and air photos. thus similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Orange film.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotational: simulates a black / white film illumination with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celesteffects and can simulate lunar-fruits to the day of the day. so similar to the 003 of Cokin (TM) Rotary.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural shade of paint and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and medium touches while offering a little cold in the shades. this is very similar to the process of a pressure and redevelopment in a sepiatons. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiate; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">Adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether there is a color picture or not, you can look like a painting in an ancient master, a pop Art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall. the menu input image texture and image processing can be used.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right raises the illumination of the depth or three dimensional texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text sample is applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and changing under (2). the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiate; tool frames can add a decorative frame to be added to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos is not easy task. to keep its attention, it is a psychological barrier to keep an eye frame. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye. under image frame, the module can be started using the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. encircled with a thin line and a broad frame (ideal for black and white images), it rotates with a nice three-dimensional setting, ideal for a button effect and decoratively add a decorative frame with pattern.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This with the frame has been bigger than the original but the same aspect ratio. this is important to print the pictures, especially if you use the tool according to aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple a formatted text in a picture to any place. this also goes on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text, and place it with the mouse. use text surface, orientation, colour from colour space and character set with its properties. the larger the image, the larger needs to be the character set. to conclude, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any attitude you have chosen for your text can be changed until you select 'OK "button. after the image has been saved, the text is part of the picture. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Use the & digiate; use tool stencil to place a template on an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Picture Templates can be used in picture editing, to place templates for a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there is no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and to add with maximum compressing (9) to remove the template's size of the template. if you have to add your template in English to the & digiate; mailing list digif-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you'll need to set your template file with the button base folder inside the dialog. select the folder you can copy the template. these settings will be registered for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder was set for the stencils, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template. the selection of a folder will automatically update the template's template.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview, there are three buttons on which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button makes the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinking: this button resized the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of mouse. if you want to use the template on the whole image, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Shift: use this button to move the form below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template on your image. the picture will then be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiate; three different tools are available for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy pics.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpened mask works on the contrast of edges to make a sharp picture. actually it's not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">The focus is probably the best of the three, since it truly improves the sharpness. it is a bit complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images need a correction of the sharpness. this is why sharp edges are printed with only minimal differences to a colour point. this in turn indicates that sharp edges are printed on paper. SLR cameras will normally require more thoughtful sharpening as normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">At JPEG image, an internal sharpness of internal sharpening has been applied. images in the raw format should always be tightened in during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners spend a sharpening filter during the reading of the image. if you disable this disable, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful outcomes by sharpening a photo of sharpening sharpening. this allows you to navigate with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">But they should deal carefully, since the results are not very natural: sharpening the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise. in general, you can find it on the menu input Korrigor Refocus. under Refocus, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too tight. the solution, the image is a bit soft to draw. use the tool to make the softness with the menu input Korriggle, and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is sharp masked is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help edit the picture. the window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius, or amount increases the effect. if you make the sharpening mask too strongly, smoke and generate the impression of grates near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius will introduce a number of pixels on each side of an edge by the filter. high-resolution pictures allow larger channels. so you should make images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount is added to the percentage between the original and the wired picture that is added to the original. thereby, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The corporal value is a fraction of the maximum RGB values and the necessary differential amount. it is possible to define a minimal difference in this way for the edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change occurs between the tones of sharpening and therefore cosmetic errors can be avoided in faces, heavens and water surface areas.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unusually masked filter. the original picture is the (1) and the processed picture the (2). improperly masked with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiate; tool Refocusses, focuses on an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright infra-protected abusing filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to make a picture to & quot; refocussenquot; it is used to focus a technique called FIR Vienna Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is usually better results than insharp masked. you can start from the menu by setting colors refocus within the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular sheath works much better than the Gauß's Fel. the Gauß's Fill has a very long tail, which is far from the original torches, which is widely influenced by the original torches. the FIR Wiener Inverse the Gauß's Fill is influenced in most cases even very strongly from distant pixels. it causes unwanted outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular support: this is the radius of circular switching. it is the most important parameter for use this module. for most pictures the default value should result in 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very insharp, but then pay attention to Heiligenvouchers.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce Artefacts. correlation coefficient can be found in 0.5 and values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation is reduced to the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Caterpillar filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce Artefacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 is the image quality very bad. a useful value is 0,03. a high value will continue the image further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauss's sharpness. in most cases, use these values to avoid unsharpened filter. in most cases, if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation between the correlation and / or the rocket filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Match-size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of matrizenry can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular support or the Gauß's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any Refocussing parameters will be placed on that you will then be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module, before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible, but then leave unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module onto the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, it produces insharp masked better results than sharpening. this could be caused by a sharp masked for a bigger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never allow the effect of defuse. for the Viennese filters you can never point out the effect of the FIR Vienna Filters always at least as good as the sharpest mask. the FIR Vienna Filter is often better in processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filtering, on a small, focused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear colour picture must be corrected. this picture has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocussed result is attributable to unsufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of sharpening improvement in digital images, you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob controller sets the sharpest of the area ported to generate a more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinte allows a customized color for pupils. in case you want to adjust blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction is one of the brotherto developed tool to remove non-required artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different default settings as a starting point to simplify the restoration. the available settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">In case you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab and Advanced Settings "tab.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail work p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a smaller value leads to a consistent glittering over the image. a value of 0.9 should be so preserved, so that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the details of the convention is always underlined.</seg>
<seg id="520">Code dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes equally in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you create a film grain or CCD space, JPEG Artefacts will be best eliminated at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this puts the maximum effect factor via all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, put this value as a level of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is subject to greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is necessary, as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually, 1 or 2 is usually enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle gradual da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small. be sure that small angle should be a long runtime. you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step-length [0,1, 10]: integral step within pixels. you should set the value less than 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the More on quality you can get through dialling this option is only low. he doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load do exactly this. each setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and later will be loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Picture error is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last but still last long and a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button demolition.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can see how image errors can be removed with small artefacts. the module is used on a photograph that in Guatemala City has been used with an analogue camera. as you see, there is a unique black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey, the original image is under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiate came; cattery reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Hheert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts, for example, from dust or hair on linse. it can also be used to remove sensor people from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned pictures from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on microcameras for digital cameras, you can read these in the tutorial in English.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photo shows a typical scene with a digital camera and an high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy wall that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the lower advanced settings can remain in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. great values increase the time by the filter per pixel and allows the image administered by the radius and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller bugs are adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of sharpness. this value sets the pixel pitch to determine the filter forward. if it is raised, noise tips will be adjusted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details may not get more and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge of the filter for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the frequency response is not possible or any noise tips can occur. if you want to remove a weak or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either colour or luminance to enhance a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either colour or luminance to change an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammate tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark zones, which are typically stronger, however, the shadow zones.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase damping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter response to variations of the luminance. if it is raised, noise and phase glitter can appear on the edges. he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and store: these buttons are used for this. all parameters for space reduction that you have set can be stored in the file system and later is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your lives. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected (2) and the random reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture too cute for your purpose. the solution, the image is a bit soft to draw, is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen with the menu input Korriggle and experiment with the Glance. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiate; photo Restart is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo presentations.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts of your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compressors and local errors. the smoothing is performed along the image contours and thereby receives the content as it does the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and texturing. the textual replacement is developed with another tool, the image error correction, developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / Franndie and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas it is even very far away. as a loss of lospressionism & quot; Arteetequot; - small standards that are shown in uncompressed image. this attitude should correct this problem.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and load do exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can hereby be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo Restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last but still last long and a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can reduce how a photo of a formal noise is being restored.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO was used. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the correct one below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were reduced to an old color photo that has been created with a scanner. you can see the scan-artifacts produced by the scan lighting and photopapier. the original image is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiate; tool Hotpixel allows hot-pixel photos that were used with a CCD camera gem, eight were to remove. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by Martin Dickstop.</seg>
<seg id="554">Light, tote or hot pixels are especially important in high-quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression of hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright pivquot; on a photo with a dark subtracting method. there is currently no manual method to choose the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark. the tool will recognize automatic hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to take you to discover the dark image directly by using new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark image to the correct image. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note here that the wizard will notice the last dark and automatically refresh this in the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image range and the preview help you correct within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all examples areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate this pixel size. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durincision: an average of the adjacent pixel size is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel block is drawn up to calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear bends (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less for pixel block is approached to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixel's pixel.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less can be approached to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic bends (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a colour photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the correct image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digiate; Vignettifying correction is a tool to correct the vintment, i.e. undergoing corners, a image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often do the entire sensor range. instead, & quot; vignicigenquot; (shadows) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that sensor there. Teleprompted show this behavior too.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, it has disadvantages. many center filter need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the Blending filter, which should be impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide-angle lens should also be used, also with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise unsharpest effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great exposure of modern filters and film scanner, it is also possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by an equivalent transformation in a base that has been made without this filter. the tool Vignettifying correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright from John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the Vignettic correction filter and with three further exposure of the target picture.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light signals at the point of the largest density of the filter. the default density is 2.0, which means an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly to compensate the density of a greater degree of vigor reducing it to compensate it for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukstarch, Contrast and Gamma Settings: the editing of a picture reduces the luminance of the pixels. you must adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options, as you need to increase your settings, as you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more sensitive repositioning of the target picture, let the values for luminous / contrast / gamma at zero and use gradation from the & digiate device; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettifying correction in an image. the original image (1) shows the vignant in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a cerebral and contrast correction was also performed on the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">Die & digiate; Linear distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colorless distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree handles the overall geometric distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flawls off the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth degree is corrected to the distant corners of the second degree. if you combine these two geometrical distortion, virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of second order. using negative values can be corrected, distortion-shaped distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the order. this value is stronger than the edges as in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter has the inverted premark of the General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and leads through a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while reducing the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview the distortion correction. the values that you use for your image will be stored and used as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The V or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting-or size changes. best, you perform this correction as all the first. if you are cutting a picture new and later a mutually-shaped correction would be the effect of the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction for you, this tool gives you vertical and horizontal line line. do you move it to an important place, such as the seaside town or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button in order to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the / / hoverular distortion with the help of lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you're a hoverular distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can cut them with the cutting tool in the menu, cutting them from the image processing or via the zoom controller.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the user-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs such as recordings from the front, frames and paintings, it is the perspective to correct the every angle in the image 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with your hand, you always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the annular correction being applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red, the GimpGuru website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 IInfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left of the window you can select the range for a preview. if you shift the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can adjust two parameters, adjust the grainy and film sensitivity (ISO) if you want to simulate the grain texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and dominance of the colour green (chlorophyll in nature) in converting. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since filter channels to reproduce infra-red film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour settings are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter printed on a Landscape Photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed picture below (2) and the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO levels create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiate; Filter Film Agency is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures. this is known from classic-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to enhance the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturer has large silver grain of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photography, graft view especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controllers, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although higher values need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film producer to a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and the working (2), which was used as a film sensitivity to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiate; Filter Oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiate; Filter Oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance, like an oil painting. nature images and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers to influence this effect. the upper selects the pin size between one and five. thicker thicknesses are better for large images. smoothing the glands or, from the other side of view, the charities.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and which is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and Glance 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiate; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients for creating a coal deposit. therefore, images of their gradients are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene they would have chosen to sketch out. these are good pictures to begin with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the bottom adjust the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result may be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiate; filter engraving your image in 3-D as if it was stamped on wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiate; filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your pictures with a simple structure, in which color does not use the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monastic landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraver filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2), which used a depth of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effect. it is used to copyright protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: splits the image in the cells, and it can look like if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1 is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need long time for calculation and generate a high CPU load. you can break these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using nonsharpness effects. it uses the copyright-protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom indefy: wiping the picture along the circular lines that go out of a center. this simulates the sharpening a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial imsharpest: wiped the picture by rotation of the pixels around a centre. this simulates the sharpness of a rotting camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: wipes the picture to create a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to resign back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement of motion: wipes the image by horizontal movement of the pixel. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photography, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Delicate unsharpest: wipes the image soft in the dark and strong in bright tones. this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Contaminant: wipes the image by random shift of pixels and simulates the sharpness of a motionless moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpest: find the colour tank in the picture and fry them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells, and then it is created by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The Regentropets are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image. this gives them natural pictures a great appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyright protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size does not allow the size of drips to change. since the drop-size does not grow automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. amount changes the amount of drops. fishops changes the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep using & digiate; editing a section of free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that will remain freely. if you leave the filter Regentropack, the range will remain blank by raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropack's filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirroring or turning into the right orientation. the tools for this purpose you will find transforming or transformation skewers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflated is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to increase a photo in a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is, how can you wake up a picture and get the details sharp? how can you find out the missing information or guess? the Cimg algorithm used here is a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the size of size. select transforming size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size will use a linear interpolation method to amplify the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for blowing up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digiate; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to say to the tool, as you want to change size. these settings are available in the rider, New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the input of the new size is retained for the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is subject to greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is necessary, as it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons as and load will be used exactly. each deposit for photo can enlarge as text file saved and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflated is very fast with what it does, but it can still last a long time and a high CPU load after you. you can break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example of photo inflating, by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the forecast (2) is the result of the linear standard augmentation.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not just a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to assemble a picture with the mouse simply just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle, create this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you leave the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut off. as a result, you can change the size of the area to a cutting area by going to the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle create you by clicking on the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting-section, use the button The Zuill button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries to store or file Save as in the menu to save the re-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the foreseen area, you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you defined in the dialogue remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a single-format or cross-format. in the file format, the larger value of the height and in the cross-format is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool indicates aspect ratio and uses a relative aspect ratio. that means it is always equal to whether you may be centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you may see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to be selected horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below, you can set the Max. relationship button for cutting on the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool sets out aspect ratio (horizontal or vertical), depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical), these settings are stored as standard values in dependence on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data are mirrored and not the original picture.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of contracting assistance enable help to capture them, so that you can create your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-rule, harmonious triangles is a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division of a different natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussels or the petals of a sun flower. it emerges in all possible things that we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used already with the old Egyptians and Greeks who designed the temple and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you joined your pictures, buildings and even photos related to your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc., where every number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two numbers in the middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden-centre provides liquid aid lines, if you have an image. these assist will be enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring you good results for your photos to get closer. compared to third-thirds the golden spiral line of the eye can follow through the picture. this kind of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow on this type.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. it should give something that the eye can be in the center of composition. this can be a line of its or different objects. this something can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also toppled from the top. its failure are the center of sides of the golden rectangle. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equilateral triangles. diagonal to this lines can place a static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles use your frame around your frame, you will create a effect from a professional photographer dynamic Symmetry. try to place your photo focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition you can't reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirrored and vertical mirror can be used to reflect harmonious particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color, you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the support lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the colour of lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easy to adjust the camera not exactly vertically and horizontally. this creates a picture where things are turned around an angle. you can repair this with the & digiate; image editing and tool-free rotation. choose Transforming the free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slide is set in degrees. by default presets you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will appear on the right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module contains a horizontal and vertical line at your disposal. move the mouse pointer to position the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the image, you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to repair it is the function of transformation from the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the automatic function automatic. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option sets the picture a bit after rotation. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All percentric transformations are performed at a fixed point in the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you have to use the red squares in the corners of your image. the preview can then be calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information which you can help to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty sections created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty sections created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees towards the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees near the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees near the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little added. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have attached the perspective, you can easily cut three angular holes on the corners. if you want to clean this, it is the picture with transformer cutting from the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The switching tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part to the opposite. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle will be transformed into a parallelogram. you can restart this module over transformation.</seg>
<seg id="679">Make your picture by using the Horizontal angle and vertical angles. if you press on presets, the angle is reset to zero. a preview of Effective will display you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed right from the foresee.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button in order to adjust the lines to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the draw, the picture will be a bit wired. for a single layer of this effect, this effect is usually neglected, but two notes are given twice as much as incorruptible and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shifting, the picture has a beautiful triangular holes in the corners. an option to eliminate it is the picture with transformer cutting from the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiate; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. the formats are therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the type like this libraries compile, you will be able to edit a large number of pictures with & digiate.</seg>

<seg id="731">Other required software: & graph viewer; is a & KDE; -program that requires the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the presentation of graphs required. needed in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the opened graphs, each in its own window. initially, when you start & kgraphed; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom image file. in this case the tool bar contains only the icon file and open the (empty) List Last updated files. Click on the first icon to display the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selected one or more & dot; files selected, the main window looks like in the bottom image photo:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the character space. you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressing & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming in both directions is limited by a factor of 10. below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization is available to localize pictures geographically in the spherical coordinate system that is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitudinal and width of latitude is used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korstator. this interface can lead a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call up the menu. in order to unload a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to upload a trace file with GPX file. of course, this file contains the rest of the same time at the same locations, as pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, a automatic correlation is performed in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT-time and therefore the camera system must be converted with GMT. this can be done with the time zone. Click here your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">Setting for the maximum time deviation is a top deviation for GPS time and camera capacity. if the deviation is carried out, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the GPX file and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds is then correlated to all images in this field.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in min. can be used if you do not have any matching data. if you know that in reality, you can set a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can correlate these limits and then correlate to the button.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialogue. this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place. as the dialog can use the coordinates from a call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed area and can be set. select the relevant region and get it again through until you have a sufficient accuracy. the amount must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>

<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user to how far the action is. press abort out to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module creates the pages, the window is not automatically closed. therefore, you can read the program reviews in order to see if errors have occurred during creation. the web browser is automatically launched to preview the preview list.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI Image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows to view a selection of pictures and implement basic operations like filming, zooming or scoring. the viewer can use short commands and Maussten. it has been developed for quick image display and rapid access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After start a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module permits to store images in JPEG format, without the usual losses on quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss of loss is that the file size increases, as no compressing of the colour information is taking place. for example, there is also again the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera-client is a tool that you can connect to your computer with a digital camera.</seg>

<seg id="841">This function doesn't work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please look exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Kodierer can be used to convert selected pictures to a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packets MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the single pictures you can add a basic screen size. you can also add a audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide.</seg>
<seg id="844">All pictures will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can create a background colour for the slide. with this module, it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. you may also use the K3b program for burning the media.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the pictures which will be packed into the MPEG Diasau. then you can start the module with extras maschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">These selected pictures are then listed below image files. there you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to select the file on a TV, you must default the respective TV Standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture. the speed of the picture is specified among them. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth white-shift.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt you should set it black. you can determine the name and path of the generated file. keep your name mpg if possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file, then it will be integrated into the film. after all settings you have adapted your wishes. depending on the speed of your computer you can now go quickly or in all the rest you enjoy a coffee, if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that codiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">Print assistent allows to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard Photosizes. the combined pictures can be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is, for example, make sense to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import / convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: expect from dcraw not that there is the same results, like the software from your camera writer. sometimes you get better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file that will be converted and run the module. the Raw-Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image. by the button Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains equal and only the extension is accordingly adapted. JPEG uses a low-loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged Image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your picture and uses the lossless LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you pre-edit your images often or later you should not use the JPEG format, as it allows only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as memory format, the metadata that contain in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting the conversion. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use abort.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stack-processing mode allows you to convert various images to once. if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single pictures. however, you have the possibility to automatically rewrite it automatically. however, this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier test. however, the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all the pictures in an album. it uses the image from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several pictures of an image collection. it uses the image size from the ImageMagick package. you can add the image size or enlarge. in addition, four types of the image change can be provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the picture will be automatically chosen, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): the change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt your image to screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Proportional: proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>

<seg id="881">After selecting the comments in a attached file, comments to images in a text file added and the mail are added.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among the loss-free formats such as TIFF. you should therefore have to use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG image file format and files the original files in JPEG format, then the original exifdata are added to that pictures.</seg>

<seg id="888">The loop makes it all displayed in an endless loop, you can manually start with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images accidentally choose that the pictures are displayed in a random order. so, no sequence of pictures are used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between the pictures, the timely distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. you should see this one before you'll show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects of which you can choose. by chance, choose from any transition between images a different effect.</seg>

<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse the pictures on certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, to pictures where Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user guide book for & kphoto album; if you don't like to read manuals but rather like new features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & photo album; and check out the quick click, the screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & photo album; and select the first dialog box, if you start & edit your photo album; first time, or select the menu help menu entry photo album; then you will download some sample images and you can try the functions of & photo album; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, please find it on the homepage of & photo album; as a connected HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the main window of & photo album; see the timeline. a picture of this corpest click here:. as the name suggests, this corpest shows you data about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each body then shows a different unit. you can switch between the units of years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the body only 10 minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be interactively using the following ways: you can change the displayed preview of preview video from the database (if you select a date, you will see the first picture of this date in the preview window) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview list.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select a section, you will only see images of this time period. you can break the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& photo album; gives you two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures. the one is integrated into & photo album; integrated and the other is available as module (see). in the following part of the user's book, it is described in & photo album; integrated version which you can create over the menu file HTML... click on.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages will be created you need to make some settings. these are divided into three areas of content, layout and purpose. in the following, each area will be more accurate.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overclock and a description which should contain the HTML file later. upon photo album; HTML example page you see an example of this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose if a & photo album; -Export file is to be seen on the overview page. you can find information about export files you'll find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages. by this way, you can avoid that information is displayed without a description. for example, you can't use pictures of a party. note that each pictures are exported. you can not use this attitude to hide certain pictures from particular viewing.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most of the settings are unique, which is why it is not particularly received.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions on the images. therefore, those who want to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600, no more images, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the dissolution at any time you have specified. so he can get your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transfer time, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this installation area, you place the different folders and URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a basic folder for all your HTML files, and for each next set, a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you must select the main folder in which all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the future images. here you can choose either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if they are really all visible to the viewer. if you have created for the basic folder, a web browser, after the pages will be created, should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will restart in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">In the case that the HTML files produced by you do not have to copy it manually. thus, the import-function, see, correctly, you must specify the final target of files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The ones described just described above were based on basic folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder will be used, whose name you set up in the output file.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking for a family party, a meeting or somewhere else, with other users of & photo album; you may need to add a HTML page to viewing the pictures. however, you can add a HTML page to viewing the pictures, then you have to add with & photo album; this work is not even going to do.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photo album; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. you can import others into your database. the image characteristics are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in it if the pictures itself are stored in the file, or if in the file it is only a link to pictures, that you can have all pictures together and so independent. the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for the pictures in a double way. first searches, the images of the URL, which you have provided in the file of the .kim file, are searched carefully. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for Export Graphics is described, which you can export over the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it should act on internal or external .kim files. there are the following three selections available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you select manuals near the .kim-file, you will have to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Using the Automatically option to copy the .kim-file copy & photo album; the pictures automatically switches for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it's usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you would like that, just select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page contains maximum image size. if you are sending your friends images, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file might be very large. here you can limit the size by clicking on the maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with .kim from your web browser or from the menu file Importing... select, will import & photo album; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to imports consists of four steps. first, you need to select which pictures you want to import, after that, in which file the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you personalise the category persons to the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is required for your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialogue window, which are imported categories of the imported file, and which categories are described in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can equal the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example will be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simple to search images and look: if you look at pictures, you want to view images from different picture groups & mdash; if you are looking for example pictures of your Italy vacation, you might want to see any pictures with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the different steps of (1) Please check out the information about your pictures, about (2) the searches and look at (3) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. however, it was expanded and today also takes your videos. in many places in this manual is spoken about images, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& Kphoto album; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. it is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice, e.g. normals or revisions in CVS, back where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photo album; remember the file where your pictures are stored and used this with future starts. if you want to read another database with pictures, you can start & photo album; using the -c option. as an example: photo album -c ~ / company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">On the menu entry, photo album settings; set up... enter a window with which you can change the settings of & photo album. in the following section of user guide you will be explained to you the various settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with whom you can call your imagination and options for the viewer. for each setting, an exhaustive help is available, which allows you to set up a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described as you can designate various properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">In view of the dialog, which is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a labeling and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a Mittenlieds as explained.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the installation options, which are available to you for determining the members of the members. you can choose the category you wish to configure. in the left window is a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& Kphoto album; share its module with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & KDE; image plug-in interface. you can find information on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed through the menu modules. however, the modules can't be described in this manual, as they are not part of & photo album; however, most modules have a help page which you can call on the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules can be used together with each other, it can be that the modules have been tested with the demo database; it is why you can test new modules first with the demo database before you call them on your own pictures. demo _ demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. do not say I'd never warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use modules via KIPI, are very different, so it can be that some modules with & photo album; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photo album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications can't use their images in albums: this kind of order is not supported, simulates it for some modules the order to albums, so you can use the functions with & photo album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & recorded photo album; the current album, which is simply the current view, thus displays all pictures that show you the picture gallery at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album & photo album, the modules also have a list of albums. here's the following:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photo album; s Browser displays the content of a category, for example, all people, then each entry will represent an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category you have specified in the installation dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you select the category people, you will have posted a photo album and so do if you have selected people to view this and the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photo album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog, and select the modules that modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you can start & photo album; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are accustomed to any other KDE application, you'll see the window with which you can browse your image database. in the section we will not show any information about your pictures. in the section we will show you on this window, now click on the page pictures, which shows you an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & photo album; is the possibility to see every image with notes. this includes information on the persons appearing on the image etc. you can either play each image individually or for a larger number of pictures, at the same time. if depicted on all pictures of Jesper and all images in Copenhagen were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsen as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can set three lists with a text field by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & photo album; because you will always be able to use information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the shift of images included within the list: for example, if you are depicted a family reunion and in all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can find that the used names are moved up to the top that can be found faster and arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">In case you prefer to have a alphabetically listed list, click on the icon for sorting according to the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected remarks on each image individually, you might want to edit all selected pictures and add these images with notes. Click this case simply on the front and back buttons, which are located below the preview of the picture right up.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, have taken, it may be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu option multi-entries to use with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California. in addition there are San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the register dialogs there is possible to add a entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can also find an entry into a category and place there in order to make this entry into a subcategory this entry. attention, this is ahead you've just alphabetically sort your categories. see also.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can shift the individual elements of the register dialogs by clicking and move the upper edge of the frames, click and move. you can also make a separate window by rolling it out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs to be satisfied with the settings, click on the button Options..., which offers you the possibility to save the current construction and look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also let a frame completely wiped out. if you wish to get this window again later, use the button options... and then click on the window. this process will be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in your browser, you will receive an overview of pre-illustrating images of the currently selected images, or all pictures if you have no filters here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply by drawing the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you have a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it is displayed in picture viewer. if you don't have a window open with a picture viewer, a new ad window is created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete, and select either the remove key, or select the menu option. now, you'll show the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& my photo album; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use images to have stored on the hard disk. of course you have to record the pictures somewhere, so that you can see the view of & photo album. in the picture you can see the view of & photo album; if not all needed pictures of the hard disk can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for pictures 5-9, however, images are present, such as pictures; you can view the preview of these images. however, you can view these pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function will require you to copy files from folders and copy it again. so, if you want to avoid the insert of your images, you can't buy a larger hard drive to save all pictures on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu Images you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy you want to view the pictures so that you may wish to see for other unapproachable view. alternatively, you can also view all the pictures that you may see your little sister may control, control, and menu entry all other than in recent view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this, you have set what images should be hidden in the case of anything. if you have a laptop now to your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, so all pictures you've locked out will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures once more, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to commit a password to unlock the pictures. to install this password, select password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please consider that this picture protection is not very secure in case of this picture. for one, everyone can read or delete the password as unturnkey text. this kind of password protection is only used to denounce that with & photo album; not very familiar to the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to describe all your pictures with & photoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it, of course you want to consider them sometime. for this reason you can look at some time. for this reason you can see them from preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have about the image, like who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the InfoBox is in the top part of the picture you want to see, so you can configure them with the mouse. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed at all. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here, the browser, look, matching entries to this show. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all images of Anne Helene. as if you select people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded several pictures in the viewer, you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons very high and down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these features are also available from the context menu.</seg>

<seg id="999">A very useful capacity of the viewer's album and photo album; it is used to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer you can easily move in the image and zoom out. to the mouse button you can easily move out. using the Minus button, you can zoom out into the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the picture is not zoomed. with the uniformity, the zooms sets the zooms so that each pixel is equivalent to a pixel's pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zooming operations that work for videos that are coming in and out zooming with the Plus- and Minustaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Rotate the shooting functions from the context menu. this doesn't work with videos. you can make comments on the current image with the menu option notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you can look at pictures you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. in the moment you can view the viewing and configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, they may prefer to mark the picture and consider further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to see the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you'll view one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features while you are viewing. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you can print the corresponding letters. see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, these are available to you in your browser. so, if you have all pictures you edit, print or whatever you have chosen, you can use one module to copy the selected pictures on a CD, or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and particularly features can be shown in the preview view. if you can view these categories in Dre preview view, then you can add features to the pictures by simply press the character for the feature after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, you can watch & photo album; painting on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painting is not stored in the image, but in the database. on the way you can reversed your gems later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In a picture you can see on the painted picture. in order to unlock the painting mode of & photo album; please click on the picture from the context menu. to finish the painting you simply press the cross in the toolbar on the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">In order to work with & kpovmodelling, you have to use the application of the program & Povray; not complete rule, but the documentation too & Povray; should you absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object-tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously, but not the object of a selected object, as all subobjects are already selected using the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool bar, or select a menu entry in the menu insert.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following procedure will be built, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar, or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click on application to take these changes. if you have invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can view the input commands, and then click on application or discard changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; enter user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or a part of texture, you can see a preview of Your Own View.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press on preview in the Capital View and a small example of the scene is ripped by the chosen texture. as default, if you want to create one texture in texture map (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), you cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen photo shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button, and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear, and it will display a small cross in the wire-model view. this cross is marked the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visibility stage. you can specify it relative to the level of the superior object or as an absolute value. objects are only then displayed if selected are or their visibility stage less or equal to the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeled, it has a window order form as default. the object-tree and view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order, or if you need a different arrangement, you can save it any time. you can also save several window orders and change between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To insert a window over or below a view, drag the link to the upper or lower edge of a view. a rectangle will then display the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the link to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view, extending over the whole height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over one another, drag the arrival in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flashcard reiter above in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window order form are floating views: views which are not embedded in the main window. to solve a view from the anchoring, drag the arrival on the Desktop, or click on the little to the left top arrow in the Andebar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the Anfeeder bar. to prevent the left, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu view, you will find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view allows you to save with view window order... store. it will be a dialog displayed in which you can store the window order below an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can rendering it. & kpovmodeled; used & Povray; 3.1g to rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual is written, & Povray; 3.5 relevant. this version is not supported in & kpovmodelers; version 1.0 not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the symbol Rendering The symbol Rendering in the tool bar, or select the menu entry point of scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode is equivalent to the entries in & Povray; s Ini files. it defines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to set a scene in different sizes and quality levels, you can insert many Render modes, from a quick look to full images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render or in the toolbar, or in the Render Modi menu... select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Every Render mode has a name. you can enter any name any name, but it is useful to recognize the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the check box section and give the image section to the rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field, you can select the characteristics that use & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflective photoelectric sensor. a detailed description of Render properties can be found in the user guide book & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is drawn with only one beam per pixel, various errors can be produced. these pictures often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in bends and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. in general, see images with this property better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard a adaptive, non-recursive way; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive, because each pixel is continuously split and adaptive because the score of records depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam of pixels. if you adjust the difference between the values to the adjacent pixels, then both pixels are calculated using a particular additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the depth value of 4 additional points, a grid of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the following threshold is higher, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be followed individually and can be tested for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the records can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you place jittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map map, you can adjust if the alpha channels will be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have not met an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console input. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene to import, select the menu entry file importing... and select a file from the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodelers are currently supported; not yet the complete control summering of & Povray; if, when importing errors or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodelers; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRwBegin and / / * PMRwEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can extract objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this adds the source code to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply mark the source code and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insertion in & kpovmodelers; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodelers; a scene renders. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the Capital View, click & Blpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation on the displayed object. please ask the path to your Documentation and Version. it supports the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; search for external files (for example altimbers) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you include files that are not in the file of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is used in different ways of the library, the first folded file is used.</seg>

<seg id="1063">The colour for the control points. the second color is used for viewing the selected controls.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the viewing field in the camera view and in the window-type characteristic.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the objects on the button in the context menu of the Settings menu set. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling, and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give a more accurate wire model and therefore a better sewing for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects, such as the ball, you can adjust the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross high detail work for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided into, if the camera uses an enhanced projection. expanded projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to the projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you indicate a wall, a wall is mounted behind the objects. the wall is shown in a checkerboard pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a ground is below the objects. the floor is shown in a checkerboard pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you are activating cantezation, the non-recursive antialiasing method for the rendering of scenes is used. the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted. more information regarding the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can create existing window arrangements, or create new window orders. in section window orders, you can create and store shutters.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination field Standard window arrangement: displays all existing window frames. & kpovmodelers; uses the chosen window order in the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list preceding window frames shows all existing window arrangements. you can create a new arrangement with the button and remove a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views of the chosen windows arrangement. new views can create and remove selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unlocks, you will receive a flashcard view together with the previous view and viewing the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeled; installed and now you want to follow no more specific knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate, simple scene, among beginners: a sphere on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider following warnings if you are complaining that you will receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, do not use rules for rendering, as a result you can obtain a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene lies in the dark and you'll only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything faultless installed, you will see from the first start of & kpovmodeled; following default shutters:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation, so you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeled; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry to edit. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wireless model view shows how the camera is watching the whole scene. in particular, note that in the fourth wire-model view (right below), this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the results of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new record with the name camera. if you click on it, you'll find the content of view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera, this is future instructions reserved, but notice that the camera can change in the viewing point, with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click on the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button or press the input, change the wire model views and the object-tree immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you might add a cube (insertion end body quader) and size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an awkward approach to the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodelers; indeed offers a simpler opportunity. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plane in the object tree, change the name and then press the button applicationor the input. in the object tree, the new name is immediately shown.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view is also showing the plain, although at the moment only as a limited endental level. if you rendering the scene, the plane bends forward.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you're looking at the object tree, you'll notice that you can check out the input for each new object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit among the horizontal line, just allow you to know some of these parameters. select a shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the bottom to set up its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something special at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens, in which you can select how the object should be inserted. the pigment will then change in the object tree. you can see the name in the property view (name = Ground pigment), with a click on the button you see how the pigment now looks like.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments only shows a mattes black material because you can check the appearance of materials anytime with a click on a preview. also, there are many possibilities for the pigment. also, there are many possibilities, but take now the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you look no color on Quader and ball in the preview, click on the button application and then click the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color name. here are further settings required. in the colour list you need to insert two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do it more frequently, but the box color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, choose any colours, and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should already be able to run, as you should have understood the basic version of & kpovmodelling; already understood. the ball can be just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input or button to press), so the ball has got contact with the floor. otherwise, the ball would have moved across the floor to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering makes now a strange result: as already seen before, the ball surface is like a mist black material. put an appropriate material in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material now. like the bottom, enter the sphere a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose stormy object and change the name for example in the pigment. Click on the pigment, select, and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects, if you take time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen pictures and click on users or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already give up some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal is still not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what opportunities you & kpovmodelers; offers. hopefully you have learned so much you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraytracing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you prefer a scene, the Renderer hypothetical radiance from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera, which renders the scenes) by any pixel. the ravender will be calculated using the visuals of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects are processed for pixels. so, the scene is pixel's pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you'll see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye, with whom you see the scene. without a light source you'll also see nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously every scene needs to be prevented, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in default file dialog, you can select a file that you made with & copovmodelers before;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. is it a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last stored version. all changes have been discarded since the last storage.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry only if you have not stored any stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reverse order. this menu entry only can then select if you have used editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Store the current window order and opens a dialog, in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement, or write an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting & kpovmodelers; here you can change the appearance, the key shortcut and the standard behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change pre-set short commands for & kpovmodelers; change commands, or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Open a dialog to set up the toolbars. you can add and remove them with this option tool symbols for & kpovmodelling.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump map is a possibility to modulate rough surfaces without any buttons on the surface, without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for a Bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Plots are simple geometrical forms which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are made from dozens of or even hundreds of these plots. these models are then processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color on pixel-based, by using a picture file as color map.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuppe show; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application features a file browser where you can select pictures for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Pictures can either be displayed in a separate window in size, image or screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & outfeed show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can click with clicking the & LMBn; or the key return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust if any image should be displayed in one of its own window, or if all pictures should always use the same window.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface from Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlists browser and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function will be & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and KDE; in addition, Amarok has some own command-sharing options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script may not be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script, if all necessary modules are present and use kdialog, so that the user may not run why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Requested 'Corundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is Required for this script.' 'dialog --sorry' # {error} '</seg>
<seg id="1187">In folder scripts or templates, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required features. you will quickly find that the letter of scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP can exchange your scripts containing Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is the use of command dcop; which should be connected to any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable the output of external programs and commands. in this case, dcop &gt; function can be accessed relatively straightforward. in this way, dcop &gt; can be accessed quite simply. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends messages to all running scripts. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default settings and respond correspondingly to events. of course, a script will ignore the events if there is no use of it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script, configure the setup dialog. to store the Save and store of setup data each script must take care of. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder, where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is alluded. the script is now & zb; with DCOP functions for further information on the new piece (for example the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume-Change newVolume signals a change of volume. the new volume is a unit value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customizniated: submenu itemTitle: contains the path to the selected files of playlist, when a user-defined menu entry can also be added to the script it can use dcop amarok script addressing menuItem (submenitemap) to remove one entry to remove dcop amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenitemtitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok will end, or if the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do so, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amara script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server; such packages are in the reason normal Tar archives (.tar) which can also be downloaded with bzip2 (.tar), so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 is only allowed to accept script packages with the Extended Residential script. for that reason, you should rename your script packages at the same point.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar-Parameter-p to obtain the file rights:</seg>

<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here, general program settings can be carried out. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at Anhieb. this dialogue is intended to personalise and customize the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is how many other & KDE; -applications are also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions to use, you can use either the command line dcop, or that something more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functional scope, therefore, more your taste and type of your task will be crucial, which of the enclosed programs will be given.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you can use the command line dcop. to make use of the & DCOP; to use functions, you must make sure that & k3b is started; then enter something like that at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & KDE; -program are in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts mentioned below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The DCOP interface's standard DCOP interface is & k3b; provides functions like copyCD, formatDVD and further functions to create new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">COPProject () DCOPRef create.com Project () DCOPRef create.com Project () DCOPRef create.com Project () The COPRef create.com () BCOPRef create.com () (), burnCdImage (), burnc image (KURL url), burndvdimage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one can create a DCOP-reference to the newly created project: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is applicable only to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Localization Folder (QString name, QString containing), paddurl (KURL:: List List, QString) (QString path), rename Item (QString path, QString-Name) with setalumeID (QString)</seg>
<seg id="1492">With this, it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several files, and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface create.com / foo dcop $PROJECT create.txt / foo / home / truste.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudioCreator; is an audio CD; it is an audio CD; it can easily be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder's installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator: is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and from many codiers who are currently coencode for OGGs and FLAC (lossless compression). additional codiers can be added to the program (if installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed to the MP3- or OGG format, or in other formats like the lossfree FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, the reading of & CD; is used by & coaudioCreator; cdparanoia has been used. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codiers have already been installed. however, all these programs are usually not necessary to compile it. however, only if FLAC is not used, the installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which code file / file format should be used? see Chapter Welding Kodierer is a small introduction about coding, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying of protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & coaudioCreator; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection. if not the firmware version of the & CD; this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection. in any case, & caudioCreator; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. avoid the purchase of copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only one must be done (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found), afterwards the daily handling is explained to read a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble over at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1505">This is only a brief list of commands from the main window. on the side step, for example, you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program's configuration.</seg>

<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that you can read the option with another encoder as the standard. it is to be observed that previously the Encoder has been configured in the encoding settings in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that a selected file will be selected to encode instead of a full & CD; read and code reading.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages (such as protocols, piepses) for programme events (like reading the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudioCreator; with different card cards (like Encoder, to set the encoding). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coacherer and compression rates and helps you in choosing the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'Monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression, MP3 and OGG files are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bitrate, the differences are less important because both codiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'No so 'free, lame will still be supplied with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to high-quality sound quality (at high rates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower rates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG cutting sets is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - When music is also heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009, these devices mainly support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list with parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer to most people and most musipieces acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset Extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of titles. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a titels. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and autosteresystems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane' = 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you necessarily have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this attitude.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information which are manually entered into the program via the freeDB program, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used together with & coaudioCreator; and the code program to create folder and file names, as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the codiers and these parameters here. manual or assistance to the codiers tell the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; Title to the key words (English: day) if MP3s have to be coded, the switch -tt of lame and the title Parameter of & kaudioCreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters which can be used (= button-name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That is what freeDB is: a free database, in which people can read / enter the information, so that all other information can be downloaded from yourself in the hosts. it's to note that here is only spoken by text: & CD; Title, Artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal but I (Anm of the Ueberber: this is the author) I'm not attorney. however, nobody can prevent from the & CD; more or less value, so neither can the artist nor the music business get attached to the music business. all information can be done anyway on a bumble through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; it is active to select a check box. for use of freeDB can be fitted with another (counterfeit) address used in the system. in this kind of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used in retrieving data from server (This may only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudioCreator; to use freeDB, the geographical position is to be used on the next mirror server. this saves bandwidth on the network and compares the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online check of & CD; information about reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which output program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to store in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know it, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to be observed that the cdparanoia package from the matching distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the selected wav files, the codierer can be selected to save the desired file format. at first open, there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab. other codiers can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The coater package must be installed from the relevant linux distribution before the codiers can be used. this is also necessary for pre-defined codiers. additional information on codiers are located in Chapter Welfare Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Code, further information can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed codialist.</seg>
<seg id="1540">That can have many causes. check out the device type of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reader use of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to put both programs with a command line in a terminal. that might give a hint on that which is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the shell CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this may give tips as you have to go forward.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by step example, and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time and read our first & CD; we will use 'lame' --preset extreme 'to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 key words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame on your computer. both programs should be available as a pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. however, it is not necessary to compile a search engine as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission to own (eg; by using the Conqueror to copy something inside).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setting of & kaudioCreator; something which probably is done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the approach to read a & CD; what a pertinent & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the using codierer for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset Extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with the freeDB file to download the & CD; data from the Internet download.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we are probably not able to read any of any & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device number will be handed over to the elite program that it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device number of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map of general settings. here you can't do much to do. here you can define an additional conversion. in our example everything will be loaded / entered as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only selecting incomplete information, so you will be informed when data are missing to bear witness (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; automatically download the internet from a freeDB file.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the reading of the & CD; to be connected to the Internet in order to access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selector box is easier, becomes a & CD; entry was found immediately to read the & CD; that's unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filename or tag entries, they can be easily changed with Conquette &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection box and freeDB file is not used. however, this is worth over 620 MB in offline mode, if you use freeDB in offline mode, the two selection box must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up in the card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freeDB for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freeDB server via the Internet. how does the system which data will get the CD? read the section via freeDB. just put everything in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we didn't download the database, we just want to work on the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to page freedb.org and look after a mirror server close by. on this way the load will be distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work as equivalent to the server, as many firewalls are connected to the protocol of 8880 standard, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol usually is open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit any & CD; data to the freeDB server. the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">The number of allowable pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know it, therefore just try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross the & CD; throw out at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined files for temporary files: when you cross it, then the path / folders can be specified in which WAV files is available. if the box is not enabled, files are created in the private folder. do not forget to make this folder when you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything will enter as it is on screen photo. the command is a bit long, under circumstances, something must be blamed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of creation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' meeting for & KDE; in case of a later amendment of the Tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest like in screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: when a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; this configuration is used as standard for each evaluation of a & CD; when you chose the organisational structure of your music, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section is described as the process of reading the & CD; on the hard drive runs out. we will create MP3 files. first, a connection to the Internet is built, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from freeDB can pick up. the process of the freeDB must be described, must be repeated for each percentering & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD which is not yet contained in freeDB, the screen photos are a bit different from the data for a & CD; with successfully dispensed by freeDB, you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of retrieving them from the Internet. comments are to be found on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the & CD to find this example. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not been done so now the & CD; into the drive, which was defined in the main window, has to be pushed.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in screen photo. this only if the & CD; identified as an audio CD; can be identified and used by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Warning: if the & CD has been successfully collected by freeDB, all the tracks are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; keys for your & CD; gives you a window appears, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion fits best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for the automatic retrieval of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the Settings), you can also manually trigger the option of the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have local database, but need the data from the internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - entry of CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the input 'actuator title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the Command field 'Update', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments inially per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieval from the data from the freeDB, the CD editor is not empty, but it's always a good idea to check out the content of the CD editor (e. g. if all the words are with capital letters or not...), but also to examine whether there's any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you are allowed ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudioCreator; you will have a look at the tab 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information from the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. see in the help to the codierer after, in order to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select an entry that obviously coincides with the style of the cuddle CD; in this example, this is not important because we do not transmit the & CD; data anyway do not provide information about the categories of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop, or Rap, for example, to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editors will be back and you see that the fields are already covered with the collected data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current play. the title of the piece on any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click the next line in main window and proceed in the same way up to you all the title dates of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear if you downloaded the data from the freeDB. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. be aware that the artist and the album will be displayed on the play list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked so selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece, or use the button all pieces to select the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection out of the reading process, this window appears for confirmation. then click OK and then we'll take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control orders. the first piece is currently read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">These error message you can see if you are attempting to work with a codierer you haven't installed. pieces which have not been successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the list list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target group are not what we have entered in the example. did you checked if you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The assignment # 1 reads the first piece, it's finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. thus, check out and coding y parallel. please note the status within the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has found no configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only thing configurable is the result unclear. the employed machine with a amd64 seems to have no problem while simultaneously read and coding (from however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is encoded, and a third order is encoded on the maintenance-long period. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a short time left in the top left of the window appears.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & coaudioCreator; you need & KDE; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create zipped audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudioCreator; today, CVS will run as part of the cultivation media package. however, if you are already familiar with CVS, you can download a copy of an important & KDE; most distributions are already a pre-compiled package, as & kaudioCreator. if you read this, you have already done the package to cultivate it from your distribution. if you read this, you probably have done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people who are compiled by source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program needs to be adapted once, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calluses many different programs, has many variations on settings. best read the step by step example to know the options and settings. it shows screen photos of different cards of the settings and also contains comments for the options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, still on reading? even if only the help menu click on the first stop of the program, without any reference point, as it is expected to continue from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">Why is it? who reads this, presumably the program has started. it should look somehow like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot perform this manual. it is thought to do something useful or change, let it do. at least just after the contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and therefore agree with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange when you have managed to get the source file from & KDE; SVN, you do not need this information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the Midi- and Karaokespieler of & KDE; besides others, he has a real-time graphics and karaoke-real-time texts of texts also some properties that do not have other & UNIX; MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, thus should work on all systems with OSS - and & KDE; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is required for GUS cards. Alsa is included, as soon as it supports a sequenzer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the song text on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of every MIDI channel, through the lifting of the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so you in & KDE; any MIDI file from a & conqueror; -window can pull at checkout time.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files (love events or text events). KMid automatically determines the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you finish & KDE, during playing a song of a song, KMid starts the next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... select from the menu file. it's the usual file dialog, which allows you to select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also make a file from a & Conqueror; -window in the & kmid; window can drop. this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and open the button playback in the tool bar, select the entry play out of the menu, or make the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece is automatically starting as soon as you move it to the & kmid. (with more pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece plays, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob and go.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click on the left and to the right of the Tempoclick and so the playback speed will change. in order to get the original tempo, double click on the template LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the button pause, or select the menu entry break in the menu, so interrupts the space bar while no play is played, start & cmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Song lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces apply textures, others use lyrics event and another both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can adjust which events are displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined using a song, so you will have to set nothing manually. if you select the entry automatic text file, you will automatically change the karaoke text, but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other kind.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up a type of event, select from the menu settings the entries text events or lyrics. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files, which you summarize. these are played in the range after you. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To install a collection, first open the collection manager. these can be found in the Menu collection under the item.... Click on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then select the name for the new collection. this collection will be included at the beginning of the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set the desired destination Manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">Into the temporary collection all songs, which you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When using the application, this collection will not be saved. remember, if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, they must be selected in the Collections Manager. there you can add to the button adding a song. it again appears the file dialog, which allows you to select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection (using file opening or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add-up to the collection is not activated, then the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you'll need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs can be played. if you select a series from the sub-menu popup sequence of the menus, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the select list on the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the Next song, next song from the menu, or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button below, select the previous piece from the menu, or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">Temporary collection may not be deleted. however, it doesn't matter if they don't have any role in leaving & kmide.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the Change patch to Bright piano events of Change patch to Trumpet and always sound a trumpet when it was originally supposed to play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one soundcard, you don't need an MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there is no programs to create MIDI maps. you need to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file, which saves all the necessary settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. but the requirement for this is that each appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... End Define KEYMAP "Name of the Keymap"... End Define KEYMAP "A further keymap"... End Define CHANNELMAP... End options... End</seg>
<seg id="1659">They see that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and end that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail to get in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not General-MIDI-compliant.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you must not change the order and do not change line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument need to lay on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported by a gun (e.g. with clay 60), which can be similar to a tissue dietary supplement, add the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now an MIDI file is supposed to play a touch with Patch 127 (ribs on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch included in the patch is a different percussionment instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one who means the pitch the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to indicate how sounds are depicted on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like in the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. they only need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to form sounds at the Percur canal. look for example the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to migrate some channels to others. if you want to switch back to the first and second channel, make it easy for the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (general MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, constructed according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is displayed on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the key map must be defined on the front in the file! if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example, to always use the Percor Patch on the Percet Canal.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied by the value of n * (r / 4096) and then redirected to the value of 4096, so that there is no decimal file in the Map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM is giving that a keyboard, which is a Pitch-Bender event, with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards to get two sounds up to one octave above. in order to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI-map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog. these can be found in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole range of piano keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these claves you see which sounds are just being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel, there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer uses the original instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The Canarian view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the Settings menu below the Point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The Tempo LCD shows the speed to play with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played like a music piece. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. thus, it can run the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians who can play the same score in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can make anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">That can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support has been compiled. to remove the problem you must download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's homepage)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a complete folder to a collection, but I don't want to add any files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supported & kmid; drag & drop. open the folder you want to add in & Conqueror; select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, enable automatic add to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to a temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can select the arrow key from the template - LCD, to slow playback. to double the standard tempo, click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I've got on a & KDE; -Desktop A & Conqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this Desktop (if I want to play an MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file) or I want to play a file, only change to the & Conqueror; -window switch and the desired file to the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without adding it directly to a collection, turn the automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to a temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mil and C.mid. please only want to play the first file. so you set the automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then, do you decide to play B.mide and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you so much! if I listen to those songs or the postcard, it animates me to program at & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; but I'm not trying to take a little time for my hobbies, but I try to collect MIDI files, make music and prove phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, an error or an idea for an expansion of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write to me an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make a huge joy when you send me a postcard from your residence or a Midi- / karaoke file from a local group. I will send me to friends of & kmid. if you are sending an MIDI file, you should contact me when I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and from nobody wants to get money for it. I want to emphasize that I only need this programme, because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - Keep the bug that the pitch is too high for AWE cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also is Jose Lus Sanchez for the testing of AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pepe, Urko Lusa, Peter Cordes and everyone who sent me a patch, an error message or also only a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians in the net that give us this wonderful Midi- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">Additionally on this homepage can be found & kmid; also on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arraiser / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and look at the pictures. you can also find links to sites with other karaoke songs, & etc.</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends on your soundcard. it's not the same if you use a FM radio device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have sound card, you'll need to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it runs then as if you would have a soundcard, except that of course you cannot hear music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is a information window that will only appear when information is shown in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to enrich your favorite connections under the menu. if you want to create a list of entries, which will be played after each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy. if you get an entry, his group and all his subgroups will be copied to the current category and the play begins with the attached entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and long playlist can be changed through direct emaking of XML configuration files. of course, you can only do that if & cmplayer / player can not run through the application itself. simply click on a name for a category click on the menu view and next edit a subgroup will only display the XML content of this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose from the menu, and select either the edit mode, or select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the processing mode left or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation of the modes and end may be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify from [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; will note the ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / demo / apps / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation of the cards needs not short to be short, it is automatically completed by opening a different source. this would be disturbed by the end-animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a Start Animation can be the ads of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif / mum.gif / mum.gif; & lt; / -; In list tests / some examples of sessions are supported by & kmplayer; are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. here the path of the player and the cache size of the data center can be adjusted from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'console' in the tool bar of kmplayer. here is the output of MPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback unit in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be inserted into the special field Embed for YouTube in playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So the & player player; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & kmplayer has to be used as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-Shockwave-flash in the setup dialog box of the KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & kmplayer; can be used in a consoles application and search for error messages related to the library's browser module. if no error occur here, the backend output is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">With this always a given backend for a certain Mime type is taken (of course only if this was also identified), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon all ogg files shall be used:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play TV cards either by MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be looked after TV, the scanner can be used from configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the kmplayer is to use the dialog in the settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port. here, ports should be detected (e.g., it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB input.</seg>
<seg id="1729">As the VDR support of kmplayer can only use Xvideo (probably this type of game playing of video equipment under Linux can also work. this is also possible to use the videoforlinux extension for the X server. for the XFree86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, KMPlayer uses various names for the sources. at the time of the emergence of this documentation, this dvdnavsource, dvdsource, source, vcdsource, source, vcdsource and vdras source. if they are activated, they start playing with the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1760">With the automatic adjustment of environments, in case of a new command (e.g.\\) {command}) of & coile, automatically creates a blank line (for input of the text) and the dazzing line to connect the command (e.g.\\) {command}. this function can be activated in the menu configuration. set up... LaTeX commands are deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into several elements. & latex; allow the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and sublimated element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">At the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed through a mouse click on the individual.</seg>
<seg id="1763">In creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful. once a DVI; file [device file] can be created, skips & ile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; viewer on the corresponding line in the & latex; -source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font size by & tex; or latex. there are many tools to view, conversion and printing from DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the RÃ ¼ rtsaber, the elements of the DVI; file with the editor that was clicked on a element in the DVI; -file has been clicked on, becomes the exact opposite of it. once on a section in latex; -source text was clicked, becomes the appropriate place in DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this function is used in working with multiple files. using a master-document the work with other integrated .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast construction: the latex; source code is compiled and the result automatically displayed (if there are no error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode the DVI; file can be used on each of them, and there is no call from & eyepiece.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When selecting the processing tool bar, the three large selection menus were developed for the rapid setting of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for the rapid integration of the document in sections, chapters, sections,... The generalized & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box for further information is for items such as keywords, notes, notes, or references. available items are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for one section, a picture or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a fixed name (choose a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a select list with literary addiction is indicated. in & BibTex, this only works if the file is necessary to create a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; the & BibTex; files can also be written in & ile; written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop of box with the name of tombstones will be used for the laying of the font. it can be specified for the main text, the fox, notes etc. there are the following lettering for setting:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & ile, two select servers are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and closing of the settings. 2. the document may be written by reason on hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parenthesis after the command\\ 'class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] defines the font. if the font can not start at the beginning, this can also be changed in text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered the & latex; the source code has to be compiled. the easiest way for this is the use of mending or the button fast.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & ile; storing the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document failed, the logging should be sought after the errors. when using fast-construction and eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text that will be treated differently than the remaining document. for example, a report with the font size is created, and only a few terraces will have a different font. the command\\ begin to be a different font. the command\\) may be encouraged to allow the name of the font in the surroundings.

<seg id="1781">Changes are covered only within the environment (from\\) to {rated} to\\. {environment}. there is no signposted (number) for the changes in a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are lots of possibilities to increase the readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, grease printing, cursive pressure, submissions, etc. are available. these commands either end either with the command\\ 'or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the course-intensive and is as long as GÃ ¼ ltig, until it is closed with a\\ '{emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be presented with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: creates a quote in the document. quote begins with\\ (Quote} and ends with\\ '{Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the & latex; drawing language is represented, then a step-in-step instructions for creating a document in & ile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the assistant, a bit text was entered, a few adjustments for the better read of the document should be tracked. at least one quote, a few places in a fat and cursive pressure and a poem to the application, to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, an editor-view or Ctrl E can be turned back to the editor (internal viewing). in an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">As soon as the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to a PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a large file format (engl.

<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after the click on DVI, then the document can be printed using File Print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows you to convert the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; -source code was created, the conversion to any other formats can begin in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The anticipation seek the direct leap from the editor to the able position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& ile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; access files. for this, only Modern has to be aligned to Settings... tools Bust.</seg>

<seg id="1797">The log file extension refers to the error source in source code. in the editor, the recording file will always be used in the error. in order to view the error line, you must be clicked on the error in the logging, and affection; jump to the defective line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once upon the appropriate button on the toolbar, a window will appear to choose the template's option for the document. the default will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="1799">With a selection of empty document, a document can be used either by reason or the assistant to speedy creation of a new document. further information can be included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Mainly users of & latex; use the same introduction for virtually all documents. templates can be created in & ile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; -file can be created or create a new file. & ile; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document, using a file, some character strings can be replaced by other data (such as name or character encoding). these variables can be set in settings... settings are set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know what strings are replaced by what variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSONS $$: this string will be replaced by entering the document class. typically, they are used as the following:\\ 'class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSONS CONPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to creating a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created, the following steps has been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the own template can then be selected instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created. if a simple way to create a template should be searched after one on the internet and the steps described below.</seg>

<seg id="1815">Many wizard can be imaginable. it is a dedicated type of bookmarks within the text. the menu view goes to the next or last jump stamp. thereby, this jump stamp is emphasized, so that it will automatically give you the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The work is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like & ile; though & Kate; already excellent words have been installed in & ile; important functions for writing a & latex; special commands for their selection. under editing are the following commands for the text selection includes:</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start with the menu plugins. the following dialog can be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialogue enables to manage all plugins contained and adding new plugins. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a storage place is used & quantaplus; this path to search of plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often work on a project several persons in a type hierarchical relationship with each other. & quantaplus; supports the declaration of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project project features -dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as Subproject Manager.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can look out from the list of Team Members who it is. this happens by looking for the team member from the list and pressing the smear button. the currently selected member (their identification) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nickname and attitude of your identity are important regarding messages and notes. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage of the members of the team: it can be created an event for information to team leaders if something specific happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions that are executed if something specific in the project happens. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later, how much any one gets involved, or the sending of a message when a file is secured when it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project settings dialog can be created, processed and deleted.</seg>

<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus, regarding tags including motor-integration can be changed, so the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / Small files from tags: large / lower case of automatically added tags. normal large / small scale means, the tags will be inserted as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / Small files of attributes: large / lower case of automatically added attribute. normal large / small scale means, the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if attached, is optional for tags, for which the final day is optional, this is immediately after the & gt; included.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Optional tags automatically include: as above all, for all other tags, with the exception of the simple tags.</seg>

<seg id="1955">Automatic replacement of accent: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated signs in the appropriate coding during the typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes available to identify different types of files. using the Standard Profiles, the standard settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the coding of newly created or in other ways than with file open-open files (where the coding of the file can be negotiated), but this setting is out of the same in the project features, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: select DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. but this setting is out of the same in the project features, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantum lus; creates a regular backup copies, so that in case of a power cut or crash when next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup. this is not the same as store the file. even for the stored documents, a backup is made regularly, according to the set time created.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can either be displayed in the editing area or a separate view (or documentation in a cardboard box), what makes it possible to look the documentation, the preview and the source code simultaneously.</seg>

<seg id="1964">Here, the parser and the structural tree, representing the illustration of the parser-nodes in the document, can be set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structural tree, the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure with the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structural tree settings the visibility of nodes in the tree, which will be opened automatically, and how deep in a change of structure tree is to be opened, and empty groups are the empty sections in the text, while empty groups are found in which no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for fixed abbreviations (a kind of templates) which will be unfolded in terms of extensive text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s valid for several & DTEP. this means there can be a valid Group for PHP, in which the ifby abbreviation something else than in a group is valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here, the plug-ins can be administrated. plugins are part-applications from third page, which can be re-used by any KPart-enabled application, on the most well-known & Conqueror;. if a plug-in needs to be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in if it is not in a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information will be delivered to the plug-in when starting, so it can open the current file, the respective folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in the "Only-read" mode: check if the plug-in is rejected. only read-in-parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is activated, then testing & quantaplus; if the plug-in is correct, even if the plug-in at the moment is not available, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. the support for the dbg debugger was set, as well as the support for the dbg Debugger. instead, a Debugger Plugin concept was implemented, which enables various implementations of plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plug-in is available, which includes support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; included.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the deuggers for a project begins with the option of a suitable Debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the button options, next to the debug plugin box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">One view, in which the content of supervised variables is displayed. appears normally in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view, in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appear in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debug is shown. usually appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debuggers, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debug, if necessary, manufactured, or it shares the plug-in with, on debug requirements. this action is executed by default, that a project will be used, so that the normal case must not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debug session Starts the meeting. close the link to the Debugger or terminates the basis of the sounds.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Send an HTTP request to the server to manage a Debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to watch the current document. this request will be displayed in the debut of the debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Demonstrates the debugger to start with the execution of the script and the relevant line is constantly going on. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution is continued, the script will start with the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Demonstrates the debugger to start with the execution of the script, without information to supervising variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution phase begins once a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, without going into the functions or includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, with what if possible in functions and features.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Demonstrates the debugger to move the directive and go to the next so as if it does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog, in which a variable or an expression may be entered, which should be monitored. the supervising value appears in the variation view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialogue, a variable can be entered, or a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages and CSS. day folders contain two file types, the tag and descriptionrc. day folders include two file types (above the edit window), the text and instructions quickly add to a document than a user could ever add.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be made manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see details for conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also tool bars. short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Featuresrc. file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP itself. toolbars enable the rules and information of the & DTEP itself. toolbars allow fast inserting tags in a document without any risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Day folders are nothing like folder. you only contain the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder apply the name of describable language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the day XML and declare if it is necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so that other users have a better viewing and more information about working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes every element in detail. all possibilities and borders are made in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can be found only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains as only element type over itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Type of tags is a script-function. when used is & lt; attr &gt; an argument of function. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the day type class. the name of the basic class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">It is only valid for the Type Method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to each other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes a attribute of a tag. this element can only be used for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of attribute. additionally, it contains additional tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a merely-element-type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code for attributes in the tag editor dialog, and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodology name within & quantaplus is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an intersection and a methodology. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tag name%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day grouped into the elements of a list. it can only occur to an attribute-description only once. it is an element-element element element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attributes of a tag within one dialog. this day can only happen for every attribute in a dialog only once (for example for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Gives the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be present for each field in dialogue once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may appear within the defined tags. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that end one day. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All day XML files must start with an & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces are affecting nothing, but watch out & lt & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; must be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the day XML files, the tools dialog can start in the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. select another dialog, whose simple instructions is to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This feature is currently not yet available. currently, review only takes place with the load of the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schematics. the file name for this day XML file is to be schema.d.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is as quite simple and there is a editor that can be arranged via DTD (selectable & DTEP; for a selection & descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; should be prepared for a newly created & DTEP; should be created with following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = uses 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; version 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD (HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can define actions with actions... created. Click new action to the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keynote added to this action. with clicking on the user defined a button-shortcut can be allocated; with Kone the current keyboard shortcut is removable.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the detailed settings and in execution of the action, this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action-type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that may change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), are started. examples from & quantaplus; even if the rapid start -dialog or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to find the% scriptdir variable in the command line, as sh% scriptdir / share / apps / quanta / scripts in your path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if run by & quantaplus; this is useful when DCOP is used to control the PID number; this is used if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the enumerated methods, a script input is provided by & quantaplus; in the input field input can be determined, which is to be sent to the default settings. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected field of document will be sent to the script. the% input variable is normally useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">In accordance with the input, the output of the executed application can also be diverted. there are two types of issue: regular Issue, on the default output; error messages should be specified, which will be specified on the default output, by selecting the value of the selection box:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are lots of tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group. in a given case, it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add actions and configure actions. select settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the new Action ratchet at the lower end of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add it to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and if the tag has Attributes and you plan their use, enable dialogue "Day to call" if available so that a input at using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a bad symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this icon? we replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action is better represented we will use & kiconedit; select from the & kmenu;, graphic further programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you realize what does the action does, but also to all the other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green, usually as loose, starring, further interpreted), or should be signalized, clicking this symbol is set; startup; -tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this is done via the menu with Settings... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired promotion. in addition to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder, in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue on with other tags, so there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus, functions for tool bar or it should be shared this for a better overview by some separator into multiple groups. open the toolbars dialog on the toolbar. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (left above) for my tool bar. after the selection of the element, which will be added to tool bar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I would like to add a quick way to access the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how separator support grouping. someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the & Conqueror; button the opposite of the start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by trying all the symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back in the correct folder. after reeXML does not exist, it will be imbal, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that your tool bar (s) will be loaded (if a file is opened from the appropriate type).</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the mentioning expansion of & quantaplus, for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for script language or the formatting language that you prefer to like. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; document Tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; Repository whether any one has done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. we will need to give you the first part of it, we will treat the second part here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index top element = 0.Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1 Sec2.1 = Sec4.html Sec2.1 = Sec4.html Sec2.1 = Sec4.html Sec2.1 = Sec4.html Sec2.1 = Sec,html Sec2.1 = Sec2.html-1 = $2.html tag1 = tags.html-2 = tags.html-3 = tags.html.</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the document tree. for example, see in the & PHP; documentation is something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = "age.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a sub-folder on the tree with its own content (except due to reason) mdash; but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents directory is referenced directly to one file (and consequently, at the upper end of the construction view & mdash; file is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces are affecting nothing, but watch out & lt & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendatop will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The table of contents is the area of docrc file, which is to be displayed on the frame of context and pressing of Ctrl; H for context-help would display the documentation directly. there are only two types of entries here: the contextual list (ContamList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate part context elements that should be available (for & PHP; this is the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can simply save your file docrc / share / apps / quanta / doc / quanta / doc / quanta / doc / quanta / doc / quanta / doc / quanta / doc / quanta / doc / quanta / doc / quanta / doc / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / quanta / etc / quanta / directory / quanta / quanta / quanta / directory / quanta / quanta / quanta / etc / quanta / quanta / etc / quanta / quanta / share / job documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to be proud of the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the separating resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners, or else to whom at different places will send an email package, such as DTD DTD DTD (DTEP), with email toolbar, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts in the scripture tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus, users can download it and only be made available if our team needs them as properly and used for the release, why it requires a GPG / PGP key. that will ensure the source of resources guaranteed for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you upload your passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have several keys, you can pass a button in the dialog New resource (URL-preview can remain empty) and click the upload of OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the upload DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) menus, upload and upload files and folders in the templates and scripts in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examines & quantaplus, the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and the significance. in case of problems, it may be canceled. if the integrity is provided and the resource is correct, a message appears with the declaration of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not yet supported by & quantaplus. however, the creation can be created but time consuming because hundreds of day files might be needed in day XML format. there is easier way to convert DTD to a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started by DTD Download and Converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD, which is to be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target detection name: the newly created & DTEP is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Creation line: the string that will appear in the DOCTYPE day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantaplus; after conversion to & descriptionrc; editor, which can be adapted to the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand this and understand full benefit from & quantaplus, you must first tell them about these fundamental concepts. this chapter seeks to teach them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little use.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project projects. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global items are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; utilised, are available. by toolbars over actions it is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to each in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of web developers for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; designs up to toolbars with particular actions aimed specifically for the files of a particular project. simply, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder's folder and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantitative trade; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the construction views, the boxes with info and the tool bars. please check in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the boxes with the right mouse button to obtain a contextual menu with the current documentation, such as close to the current, other or all antennilonites, re-charge or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or version of CVS repositters on the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editorarea lead to another context menu regarding the working document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the text under the mouse pointer or open the file, when the string is specified under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor there are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantum lus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars will be shown. in the course of further development of & quantaplus, the toolbars will be adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert a simple day, e.g. & lt; if you want to insert into your document, then click on the data for this just one day. if you want to insert the data for this just one day, you should fill in a dialog box of various fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction views (QIT;) enable to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate them and pass through. in the presentation with cardboard boxes are available for files, project, sample templates, documentation, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that presents & quantitilus. this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using rectangular mouse click. actions such as adding, remove, uploading, or delete the files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole site & etc. there are all options open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which context it is used. the category depends on & quantaplus; working range. global templates are always available, local templates are only usable for the respective users and templates in projects. more to templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available Script language. the concept of integration in global, local and project works too. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script. via the right mouse button you can start further functions, such as the script, to edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by left-right of an element the cursor will be placed on the position of the element. by the right-click of a element a list of commands in relation to navigation and views of the tree is opening.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other construction views. with it can change manrapidly attributes and namespaces. this allows the content-directed set system allows the change of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. it can be downloaded documentation for & quantaplus; the quantitative site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two flashlights at the lower end of the window, can be reached via the useful information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carton display shows information about each in Quanta running script. for example, the DTD's current document and all modifications to the DTD is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This carton display shows all mistakes in the check-up of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are expanded and easy to understand. show it on a symbol and they get the appropriate command. the web page on the toolbars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus is the ability to send a tool bar with email. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive over & kmail; if they receive a tool bar in an e-mail, they can backup this in & quantaplus; as any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of the & quantaplus; files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. in order to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting up & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & KDE; 3 am folder. also you should ensure that is no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH before your bin folder. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus, a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus, was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML, the developers of & quantaplus started to deal with a obvious idea: what would be, if & quantaplus, a self-expandable Markup languages would be? well, this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus now; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then, & quantaplus should be; therefore the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim has to be held that & quantaplus is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; development community is based on why did someone else develop? thanks to the & KDE; -report not only this is possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; thus to expand how they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to enhance the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity almost every task. thanks to the program Komi, they can be filled and quantaplus. by the program computation, they can be asked with no scripting language. (more about this can be found in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL file and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in detailed documentation is associated with help: / quanta (either enter this URL in & Conqueror; type or helpcenter help: / quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; currently developed and supported by Eric Laffsaloon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras MANTIA amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file, which is not on it, with the oldest entry.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check in the section above templates. should you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template's template, only a mistake is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts the special characters in the clipboard there, converts special characters to & HTML; tags, so they are displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; files, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first line for inserting & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches to the block selection. allows you to select text blocks with the Help of the & Shift; now select.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Directly to a line number. this is very helpful if you & PHP; script error messages are available!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searching for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and debug fixes.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Recali- and Switching off the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; main reporter is activated once you change to Structural.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbars on the left from the main window. this column allows you to set the bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When bookmarks in the current file, they will appear together with entries previous or nearest, depending on the position of cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu, after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project of hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the file .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presented a dialog for inserting files to the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows to copy any graphic files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & KDE; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, such as & quantaplus, administered by the project. in chapter & quantaplus; projects you find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites a project tool bar. these are stored in Project You / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be saved by settings. the toolbars will be saved via toolbars or you will be asked if you want to store the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the visible range. it does not deletes it from hard drive. if you have not yet stored the tool bar, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the tool bar is available in the next release). the menu option opens a new email message with the toolbar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars on the main server, where any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; you or someone else made and convert into the & quantaplus; own coating format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / notice the discharge from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP; to renew it without the whole & DTEP; if this is a globally fixed and write permission in the global KDE folder, fails to store the store.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu includes a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu menu in the tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day setup dialog, if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent set of tags. currently this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent inclusions means that & quantaplus is refusing if this day does not contradict the rules on this site.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins can be listed under the menu items listed above. click on. click a activated plug-ins disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Choose the syntax mode for the current file. the list of available schematics depends on your personal; -Version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line-line identification. very useful if you know people know the other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document on select & DTD; the external application is tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate shift between the different types of the user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching over time may need time or innice graphics. recommended is the card box mode, which is also the default setting, or the lower window mode, which is the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">Additionally, this menu includes an entry for each open window. with selection of a single agreement, the corresponding key window is activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Shuts the status bar on the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main hearing on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">Changes in this dialogue installs any application which use the KHTML part, including the & Conqueror; web browsers.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Edit the behavior of the editor. in the documentation of & Kate; you find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, in which you can delete records from the toolbars, or add what can change.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should produce an help in the context of the mausoleum, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and free, but as with every open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, since e.g. after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project, later with Shift; F7 project project features can be adjusted later.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here's the name for the project, for example foo. when typed, name is completed automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (eg. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you'll find the server address of the machine you want to access local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected log are used. depending on the machine's setting, an adaptation may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the file where the toolbars will be stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from local filesystem to the project. several files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have to download and change static web content you want to download and change. in serverted scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to go differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Defaults to if files are located somewhere in the main folder of the project. if a project is started anew on the project, you will not stop.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will appear within the folder's folder and you can make a precise choice after credits.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. one can select the desired files by hook, or by removing the skins, clamps out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest monitor of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be instantly upload or instantly upload the Project Properties Tab "Project Properties in the subwindow profile or using the key-shortcut Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings are described in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholder is possible) that will be ignored in project-related operations such as project folder.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to the above, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which will be loaded on the opening of the project, can be read more about projections.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This can be selected by the debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger Plugin can be adjusted with the button options. in this case, the troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the bottom-window profiles, upload profiles (see in) can be set as well as the display of a construction view for the content of the server for each profile, displaying a specific building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, processed or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration, you can add event actions and add these actions to change or delete these actions. event actions are executed if a certain event will appear before, like the backing of a file. see in details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. this behavior is currently not able to influence.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Project... from the menu project or the icon Project open from the toolbar. the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus, closed, the project file is automatically stored. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, when & quantaplus; changed files will happen if you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project view provides free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders are likewise, however, the entries must be opened and open with... in with the right mouse-click menu popup menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here various profiles can be chosen. the profile contains information on the site of the uploaded file. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if there is only one profile available, the button is blinded to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will keep in the core memory and forgot your program. this possibility is useful when common uploading of files is required and the rather unsecured password will not be stored on the record -option.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog, if you need to change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-loading profiles can be created and to upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. editing or creating a profile is displayed this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name that should be copied to files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for high charge. the list depends on version of & KDE and installed Kio Slaves. at least you should select from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. usually this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your Angular shaft, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it to your discretion. the password will be stored on the plate, so that it can not be read easily, but everyone with programmers can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can give many views in a project, i.e. by simply dipping of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened on the project or the project tool bar, accessible via the toolbar project toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has most to do. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows adapting & quantaplus; to its own mode.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; best on the menu toolbars. use and adding it. adding tool bars will be treated at the adding of toolbars below.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set up either using the context menu (right-click on the tool bar), which can be set up with the new action, toolbar can rename or toolbars, which can be specified in the dialog, where can be visible in the dialog on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a tool bar, you will additionally remove the entries and processed action that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the action on them can set up in the menu with the Settings tool... and set settings.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document reduced, code snip and files to link. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a standard file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or any existing directory available in the template-tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you need to submit to the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have conditions for use. please read the conditions listed in the beginning of any template when using.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually included in documents by linking (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples be found in the template tree under global templates. further information on templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text-document. based on these templates, new documents can be created. it makes a simple scaffst for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template-tree below global templates. see for more information about Templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful, if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template but the same text area always available in documents, with a comment via a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples of the template can be found under global templates. see for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are intended for all websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents that can be arranged in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed-tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantitioned.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure according to (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook, etc;) and select File as template Store as local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, notice that (even if it has been saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the repository. look at the template tree under project planning.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file as template. alternatively, you can save the selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with drawing and installation on the tree-view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only copy only into a template file. it can only be used for any file management functions, such as drawing and dismantling, or insert about the file tree from Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select a file tree or in the project files tree view on a folder to the right and secure site template. by default, the project file is secured, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project projects enable a very targeted procedure. you can set headlines and footer, or dynamically with & PHP; shape, files insert or link with them. in addition, you can keep some things while using templates in projects very profound.</seg>

<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template. if a regular folder would be disable unless it would be explicitly activated. in case of normal folder, the Blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows you or submit text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents to a folder with special headlines / footer lines to equip a full presentation with the matching headlines / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, select the context menu (to show the right mouse button) via a complete command collection to add folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus, offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; and source editor, which can be reached via the menu view. the first mode replaces the editing window in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it downloads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor will appear. then you can edit, and if necessary, to the source code editor, in which the implemented changes in the VPL; Editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor at a document that contains & PHP; contains a small green symbol the Vohandenoid of & PHP; -source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and in the VPL; editor synchronous mode is enabled. with pressing F9 this mode is already active, this mode is already active to the active cursor from a window to others, where the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Quanta.... It can be set between synchronisation based on a click or automatically. in general, the recommendation can be set automatically. basically, the recommendation is: a small pot for fast hosts and a big cover for slow PC.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming that you want to change the title of the website, so you can select the documentation of invisible tags in working with the VPL; the document Properties dialog can also be called as soon as a new document uses the VPL; it is used to change the Dutch code. so you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. buzzwords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added through pressing the two buttons below or removed. a Click on the list allows the modification of the content, e.g. key words on the column names and keyword Turnkey 2 on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser. one can add CSS rules on the list or delete it. a change on the list is exactly as possible with meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to wrap a external CSS style template by selecting on the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursors is like in a word processing, due to moving with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor is peculiar. text can be added by typing and be deleted by pressing or removal.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be done in the same way via the toolbars, such as in the source editor. it is noted that the insertion of tags is not removed beforehand, if an anchor day, comparted with text, must be removed each other surrounding anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool tools such as tables assistant or lists assistant are disabled. they are later used in & VPL; they will work in this release should be used to tables or lists toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & b & diff3;? let me explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes, and at the same time corrected many places. another programmers had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program was used by me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what exactly was changed within that lines. and there was no evidence in the places where maybe only the monocre had changed. that merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences in line and changes in white signs. later, any number of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare it quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it into one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & cdiff3; almost into a fully-known file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful if two people operate independently of each other on a piece of co and changes. the original file (the base) helps to edit and display the original file. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. this screen photo shows three quell files on merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you to the same and merge subfolder. this image photo shows & kdiff3; in folder combination:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and suggests the possibilities of current color monitors. if you frequently need to check Kode, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines vary only in a certain number of white signs, one can see it at a glance at the summary in the left hand side. (no offence more if any one changes the loss.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are the same name, but in different folders, you can simplify your typing work by writing only the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Calibr3 folder folder with folder 3 folder, folder 3 folder, folder 3 folder, folder 3 folder and folder 3</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual setting of filenames, the selection about the file browser (file...) or select a last open file from the list. the opening dialog can specify your selection and shows them next time. if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences is performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the default and merging of folders will be used for B and C, but then use a folder, then use & cdiff3; the file names from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging crosses, the input field is active for target and allows to edit. however, it is not necessarily necessary to establish an output file immediately. you can also do this step further with the store.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setting button opens a dialog with settings. here you can define options before you start with the same / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog, you don't need to select any files, you can simply connect the dialog by using the button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and shutdown: simply draw a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes, a file contains some similar functions. if you need to figure out how much these features are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would have to download and then compare these relevant files. now, you can simply copy the relevant sections, then compare and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: you can't find out anything from & diff3; pull out only the fallenger of text in a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors will interpret the pulling and insert text into another program as outcrop and insert (instead of copying and paste). in such a case your original data may be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional). (if the path becomes a file too long, let the mouse have a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source rounds are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed over the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, one sees on the color, which differs from it. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's good in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left alongside the text is the summary column. when differences were found, the column displays the appropriate color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it's useful to only see the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white signs are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the combination column from the text, is interrupted to the places where the source file is activated. if the line is activated, the line is illustrated on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparative version) also has a info line with the inscription issue: the file name and [Gemodic] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are disconnected, the Save is disabled!!! (use the buttons to move the smallest deleted / unresolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">When only two comparisons are used, each distinction must be solved at the same time as a conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window, the first line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed, where the start of the group is otherwise not visible.) This group is then highlighted the current group. it is highlighted with the colour backcolor for current area and each on the left appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes the automatic merge or manual operators are left no further line more in the group; then there is only one placeholder for the event that you will change your opinion, and perhaps again select another source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you might want to copy and insert.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; Contra-execution phase; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy any text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources check the options to ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mainly with the images and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard, right, down, down, side down, from the beginning, end, Ctrl-early and Ctrl end, siw as you can also use it from other programs. the oversican column can also be used by clicking on the navigation system.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with insert key, you can switch between insert and overload mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of the each group (as already described in the section) and the editing window is explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / initial / last difference (Ctrl-Picture / Strg-up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture backwards / Strg-picture) or to the next / previous conflict also after the manual trigger as a conflict. therefore, between dissolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">In order to copy the marking in the clipboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insert). if this option is activated, it will automatically copy automatically into the clipboard and modify the manual copy. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Ceiling are stored according to the underlying operating system. UNIX-based systems use a plug-in line\\ r\\\\\\\\\\\. KDiff3 retains the line end of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files will be saved automatically and re-manufactured using the next start. (click Settings - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides writings with variable width to choose from, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the chosen writing does not support this presentation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be scanned. in these systems, the knobs will automatically generate an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, the tabulator button will be inserted into the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, an tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press entering or return, the backwards of the line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is activated, any option is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual is then subject to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection of the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When using files tries & cdiff3; first to find all complete identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. in this step white signs will not be ignored. even when merging, white signs will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car-pull cord '\' at the end of a line, other again save only one line-in diameter '\'. usually ignored & cdiff3; however, if this option is enabled, wagging signs are visible, but like a white character will be disabled. however, in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored in the result but they are treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are described as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively search for smaller differences, the option is activated in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic restart mode, this setting determines how long the result of the choice is displayed before the subsequent conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves automatic all conflicts in white signs by selecting the chosen file as source. (default is manual selection.) It is useful when white signs are in many files as well. if you are only concerned the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on scanning and seduce conjunctions. see for details under documentation for the directory and merging after.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and an older version exists, then the original version is the Suffix. original depends. if there is such a backup file with the Suffix .original, it is deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. the changes in this option does not affect the current running program. you have to finish & cdiff3; complete and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set up globally through the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you use this option, the top setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">In the select fields for the coding, a short note appears, which is the local coding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this implies how special characters are treated and reinterpret. since the encoding is individually adjustable for each file, files can be compared to different coding and can be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Once you have edited a file, you can define what encoding is to be used to store.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the processing commands can only handle with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option, you can define the coding of the output of processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch off this to suppress causes of changes in white signs in the text or oversight. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may see only the differences between two of three files. by selecting A & lt; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to normal and a second oversice column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. simply click the less important window. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders side windows next to each other or above each other. this can also be useful to display long lines. (this option is available in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide unexpectedly to bring files together. a simple click starts to merge the merge and use the file name of the last source file as predefined name for output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last updated file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command first. in & cdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor, which is precisely to cut any disturbing parts or correct the reciration.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this external command, the command of command is given (see above), then the output of command is used only in line of command. you can only write your own preprocessor, which corresponds to your requirements. each input line must have an appropriate edition line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when setting up the Diff-results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program itself. the good news is, however, that in most cases, sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with you, you may start to understand it and maybe you like this regular expressions. you are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further processing line for Zeilenabili. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Every sign between '[' and ']' is a hits, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, so quasi.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several targets at one time. then you can use the Semikolon ';' to separate the sounds from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed, you can also use some other such as perl -p -E's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'allergies at perl some details different. where sed\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for displaying and merge. however, the further operations change only the data that the line-like algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal preprocessor, the line-like preprocessor uses the output of normal Preprocessor.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as in any function, the text changes or hidden differences, you cannot notice certain differences, and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit a lot of files. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & b diff3; complete folder recursive and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each item to merge; you can adjust the proposal prior to start</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the interaction and shows the simulated changes, without going to perform it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... take selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparing and merging of individual files. you just need to open files on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders will be merged, the folder will be used as a base. if no target folder is specified, use & cdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start, not to merge. in order to run the merge, you must press the respective menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you provide a little news window over the current progress. if you break the scan of the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scan of the folder is complete, shows & cdiff3; a list of Listings with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any folder which was found during the scan, is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded. you can double-click on the + / - click on the object or double by clicking on the object or by folding the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu includes two functions, all subdirectories, with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When double-click on a file, the file's comparison is started and it appears on a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane at the selected object. in such a case the merging action is not automatically selected. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above image, the A / B / C is used in the columns red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries the colour is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders will be considered as the same as all of all content is identical. then folders have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant to its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... a and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... a and B are identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (for example, if A folder and B is a file): error: conflicting data types exist. as long as such defective objects can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same type of file (for example, if A folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types exist. as long as such defective objects can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active when only two folders and no explicit targets were given, and if the option directories are synchronized. then select & cdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders will be identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... a and B, however, are not identical: merging and store the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file name for issuing file only B; directly after the merge copies & kdiff3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be activated and select the option new file instead of merging (uncertain) then the date of files and suggests that the files are different, but the date is identical. files are different, but the date is identical.. solos such errors can not be eliminated, then the folders can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While the merge will run a file after the other. it's status column displays Fertig, if the merge has been successful, and according to other reports if something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final review and see if the status is alright everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If set in the setup dialog the file-comparative Analysis is selected, KDiff3 will display other columns. these include the number of unsolved, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either perform the selected entry (file or odner), or all entries at once. if you have chosen all merge action (even in all subfolders) you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you do not have a target file, then in the three-folder merge mode C, it is used as the target, when two-folder merge is chosen as target and using syncing A and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you select a target file, please check if all entries must be displayed in the target group, even in the folder structure. there are several options to be skipped through certain entries, check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To add all entries: select directories to continue / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to put together only the current entry, select the actual element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If there are still invalid file types still invalid actions, a message appears on the erroneous elements. you may then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you perform all entries, a dialogue window appears with the options passing, simulate and abrupt.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select simulating if you want to see what would happen, without the really changes, you will receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& in diff3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual operation is necessary (assemble a single file), then a merging panel is opening (see screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready with a file, select playback to start / continue, or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then, then continues & drop-diff3; his work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on an error you'll see a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you'll see some errors that can help you to select the cause of the problem. thus, you have the option to select another promotion for the entry or solve the problem in any way before you continue with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually passed, notice & cdiff3; this entries (in the current session) and will not lead them at the later date. even if this merge result has been done or not stored, these entries will be done than done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files displayed on the specified pattern will be displayed in the elementary tree. several samples can be entered with a Semikolon; the valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not comply with this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern, are not displayed in the Elementtree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the Semikolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern, are not displayed in the Elementtree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the Semikolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autonomous produced files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .cvsignore file. (see under info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. the file system marks a previous point. this option lets you decide if these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to the links displayed. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links will be treated like normal folder and recursively. (note that & kdiff3; not rushes for possible loop loop and crashes;) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of any file and shows the Statistics columns. (the number dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when it is applied to files that contain any text. (give an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folders through a slow network, it may possibly be able to compare only change date and file size. however, this speed advantage costs you a certain degree of security. please be careful with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality of alterations. there is no real comparison instead. the files are regarded as the same as large. this can be useful if when copying the alterations date. please be careful with caution. this option is enabled in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronization mode if two folders are compared and no target file is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging so selected that both folders will be identical. also the results from merging files are stored in both folders. this option is posted in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the newer file will be proposed as promotion. (this will be considered insecure, because the other file has not been changed too.) This option is available in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder will be replaced, or delete the original version with the .original extension already exists, this will be deleted without additional backup. that applies even the normal interaction of individual files, not only the combination of individual folders. this option is enabled in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the file-merge view is visible to the merging of individual files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want that, you can turn off the window of the directory & Text window, and turn off the main window of the window menu between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply via double-click. yet, there is also a single file also directly joining the folder, without only store the folder. if you store the result, the status is settled in and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost, however, if you read the directory again: directory menu: new entry</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with help of KIO-slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote locations.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on the FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a ZIP archives with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively. or.. contain. it is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, idle &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the used protocol. there is a brief list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can not be distinguished if a link shows a file or a folder. then it will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to process permissions or change of change. hence do the permissions or change date of the original. (note the option confidentiality of size.) (This is only possible with local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as a differences viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop first starts the built-in differences viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select in KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3 requires two complete inputs. however, if it is used as a box, it takes & cdiff3; the file names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files will exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program starts to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror, you can click on a patch program and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that if there is no one of the original files. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or the comparisons of folders will not be supported in the part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is Compare) already. in addition, the name KDiff3 demonstrates that it can be merged like the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs very long and have learned a lot by finding other programs in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or go so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You might have compiled the program from sources and configure the configure PREFIX to KDE. in the default, configure / usr / local but then KDE can't find the resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs is different, these lines are first described as the same; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is not treated as not as the same. iF similar lines of next to Each other, this Ris, but this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor does not notice for any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends. this important information is required, however, if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to design an additional file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has so far too large. you can always restore a certain version of selecting a source A / B / C. to process large quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly changed; No src lints; it appeared, and the text can't be extinguished. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& cdiff3; already uses many colors to emphasize differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & KDE; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information about how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of the latest changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file Changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & cdiff3; to compile and install, use the following command in the basic folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir is the folder inside your system, installed in the KDE. if you are unsafe, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake uses you should not have any problems with compiling. should still occur difficulties, please report on & KDE and mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or reverse-wire) in the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences are shown: files are identical in all folders that are not listed in the folder, therefore not in the target group.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to update on these options to the folder with the function Update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries shown that these differences have to be copied. if the target file does not contain these files, if the target file does not contain these files, it is likely to be changed after a later program version.) This option is likely to be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with inscription A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the appropriate window is attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group (if they are not already present), they will be removed accordingly to the button on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. underpaces in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a preview of all virtual work surfaces. it is quite convenient to see the current programs on the working areas to end her size, to end her or move it. this works both within a desktop and in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual workareas as well as to display applications. applications can be selected and even moving on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible within a desktop as well as on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The contextual menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when on the empty backdrop of & Kpager, click, the context menu only displays the two entries Pager... and end. if, on an application within & Kpager, click here the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries to minimize, maximize, Desktop and end. commands are following the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window onto the full size of desktop. appears only if it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when it clicks on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows within the & Kpager window can be moved with the middle mouse button on desktop and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, are displayed in & Kpager; the names of virtual work areas are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Crossing this field allows the & Kpager to display the numbers of the virtual work areas. it is shown together with name, the names are fitted with ordinator numbers, & eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background is displayed as a background at the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, current programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager. otherwise, only the empty workareas will appear to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply displays easy rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the actual program panel. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager can be determined: classic lets & Kpager to appear; in a 2xn grid, it shows all virtual working surfaces in some horizontal and perpendicular in a vertical range, which is very good for the view on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniatures in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can display in size, display Windows as symbols or with their contents. moreover, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & Kpager; followed by selecting the switch... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this can not be changed in the dialog settings, but you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor, such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not need any write permission for the file, you must enter the key windowbanner mode and specify a value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the package base, you need a working installation of the KDE basic package.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag, is a very powerful application which is constantly expanding by new features. it is optimised for use on high-performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you start & kmag, a window appears as above. the main window of the screen is displayed. in the following, this window is called the magnifying window. the image that is displayed in the magnifying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is described in the followings as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default settings the range increases; the area around the mouse pointer is like a mobile magnifying glass. alternatively, you can & kmag; to illustrate a select screen area in the magnifying window (selection window mode) or the environment of the screen (eg; on the left screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">Do you want to avoid the mouse pointer in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer. please note that it is not able to recognize the form of the mouse pointing device. this is always the standard-KDE; / Qt; mouse option.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrows and mouse button and change its size. this can be done in the following ways:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button, so you can capture the content of the magnifying glass and move it with the arrow buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you add the & SHIFT key, press or use the & MMB; you can shift the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; possesses a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to insert into a file to insert into other applications (in order to insert it later in other applications), turning the picture and much more.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool, emulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse pouring a while on the same spot. it is thought to help people who emulate the repetitive strain Injury (RSI) Syndrome and which every mouseclick may emulate pain. however, this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool, can handle the pain that causes the mouse to use without pain. unfortunately, you can also get pain without any pain. unfortunately, you suffer pain that are related to your computer using the use of your computer, if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool may avoid pain, which are caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that are caused by moving the mouse, useless. and, as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be differentiated for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool, is simple: & kmousetool, monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you break the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent shift is activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after it's pushing the mouse button. in this way, you can start pulling the mouse button. in this way, you can start pulling on the mouse button. it requires a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This delay time must be petridden after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool, a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes shift is enabled, the rotation of shifts (1 / 10 s) is active. here, the time is stopped, the mousse pool, after which the mouse button is waiting, before it takes place the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now the click by mouse shift. is this function activated, followed by a break, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. this movements will be started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can move & KDE; to reduce the reaction time. open to the Sound & Multimedia, select there Sound System and here the rider General. there is a slipegler sound buffer, which you can set to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool is started; starting with every start of & KDE; this function is currently only available under & KDE; in case of GNOME or other window settings, please drag the specific documentation to find out how to launch there a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings back on the values, which were set when opening the dialog. already, you already pressed the button on the button, the settings will be reset, on the stand, after the final pressing of application.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool, first of all with the default settings. in particular, you should first switch to intelligent scars first. then, if you are accustomed to the automatic mouse click, you will later increase the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & KDE; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that doesn't represent a link. therefore, you can park the mouse on such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is rucketed, you should clean your mouse. it's usually pretty easy. the trick is doing it's not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse becomes different. however, it should be quickly clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. dirt and dirt can be easily scrape with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you are just a shift operation, this means that & kmousetool appears; the operation no longer can end through letting the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool, using another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists that you even run a mouse click. by this, the status of & kmousetool, set back and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & cmousetool, continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there, where you want to place it. but use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop, if you don't want to make a touch of mouse clicks. safe zones for the mouse pouring are & eg; the grey surfaces to make the toolbars and the title bar from windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I'm trying to work with smart moving, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is a more advanced function of & kmousetool, and it takes its time before you want to bypass it into the clipboard or want to move it into the clipboard or want to move it into the mouse button. but there will probably not be any problems with the mouse button. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the intelligent scars not if you're just starting to start & kmousetool; to use. mark the text instead of a mouse click and hold the change-up key, while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text, and again click the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. it will play any time when & kmousetool. the mouse button lets you play a mouse click. later you can use the smart scars without the audible mouse click. however, it needs some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, to be able to use the XTest extension for & X window; this should be the case for most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a soundcard and speakers, and it is set correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool, the mouse button then worked as soon as the mouse pouring is short. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome, and to which the stunned pains is made pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool, can also be set as reconfigured that a pulling process begins, before the mouse button is started. in this way, the bricks can also be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2623">The issue of Screen-Readern has the highest priority. it is presented to all other orders and holds these orders. if the issue of screen reader is pre-read, orders received will continue again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved for hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will continue after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message left normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application to read the messages. while you & eg; a long text on a website you can read with & kmouth; somebody welcome to enter the room. & KDE; -messages are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple textbooks. any order that you encounter from the card ordering is a text job. KSayit is an example of applications that are used in text records. text entries are intended for the edition of longer texts that have no particular credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queue, with the exception of the output of Screen-Readers. if a application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such reads, this issue is stopped and finished.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional filter filters (SDB filters). SBDs must start text in individual sentences. therefore, it can also be synthesized in the box, as only the first movement must be synthesized, not the whole text job. thus, you can also jump back or break down and break down, even if the language synthesizer cannot be supported directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional filter filters. at the first startup of & ktts; it is set automatically set up as a proclamation point filter. you can change its settings or add another propositional filter.</seg>
<seg id="2729">In the simplest way you will learn the setup of speaking selection and type text for reading. check out the speaker selection process, change some properties and check how the selection of the microphone has changed. in addition, you have to set up more than a speaker, otherwise the filter is invalid.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then begin to start reading, as only the first proposition must be processed and not the whole text block which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or abort essays on the card card, even if the language izer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal propositional filter filter is automatically set up if you start tksms for the first time. it can not be removed, only be removed. do not change anything at this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">To compare the propositional character filters, text with a regular expression of propositional and add a table sign (decimalcode 8) to the punctually (table code will be automatically removed from the text). note that the standard transmission rate filter keeps the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-filters are never applied to & KDE; messages (kByte), warnings, messages or output of Screen-Readern.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal propositional filter filters, you can add this again by charging the _ sbdrc file contained in & ktops;</seg>

<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have priority from other features. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since language is a critical factor in understanding the issue is, it will always be used as priority property. the only case you may want to specify this attribute is before when you may know that a specific application text appears in another language as the result in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the field of spokesman, which matches the default on the default, click on the select button and then use on speaker that matches the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is written for the last text job in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number is the input 0 required).</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the cardboard menu audio there is a setting speed. that this works, the program SOX is installed and will be able via the environment variable PATH. some Synthesizers like Festival games feature a setting for speed. depending on the selected voice this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the microphone speed will be ignored if & ktts; & HTML; (see that the HTML is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; based on & XML; (see) or if you are very courageous, change the .xsl file of & HTML; -according to SSML-performers, and put the speech speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it to read websites with a female voice. I set up a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNA settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of systems and desktop settings via a unified, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf file system has been developed to enable the users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf setting, creating a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new network settings in the & kcontrolcenter will be displayed. network settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched through a selection of kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf is not able to install network hardware. physical devices and their drivers have to be able to install and configured, & knetworkconf; the device is shown at all and allows setting up the network characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed with installing & Linux. network devices will be added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network interface module is loaded when the network settings are selected at & kcontrolcenter; index is chosen. when switching of module network settings, this system tries to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform is not recognized, the Dutch selection is offered. it's the platform from the list, which matches the distribution and release of the release. by marking the setting not-again, this option is automatically preset automatically at the next start of network settings.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings are only possible in system administration mode. previously, all options are displayed in colour mode, which means the settings can only be viewed in the system administration mode, by clicking the button system administration mode at the right bottom of module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode the whole functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interface serves to manage network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the rider network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The serial network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button-click interface... in the dialog box can be set up.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking on the button Advanced Settings shows the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The TCP / IP Settings can be downloaded from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP address for the system will also be used with the start of system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server will be required for the system. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual can be carried out without DHCP or BOOTP or TCP / IP configuration. in the IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this attitude is marked, the system initiates the network interface during booting. if the initialization is not requested, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">These values are displayed in this dialog as the characteristics of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. using an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & Console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off. switching from a switched network device is accessed by selecting from the list and click interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need. switch off a activated network device is accessed by selecting from the list and click interface.</seg>

<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network where the Gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support is replacing a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. that is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the calculator http: / / www.inedomain.org, DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as about 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for the name resolution part of the equestrian name resolution allows a simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed fault.DNS entries can be sorted by selecting a single agreement and execution on the list with buttons up or down in the priority list.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button you click here... from the group calculator to name resolution a DNS server can be added. it will add the new nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to list name resolution, select an entry and then click on the button.... It will be displayed in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of eminent hosts describes computer-to-IP address instructions for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used first line with boats when no DNS servers are available. in small, completed networks, it can replace the DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list includes well-known calculates some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. these can still be replaced in a test in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click on Add. the dialog New alias will be indicated.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the well-known calculator has several alias names, de knob add several times and enter other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a well-known auditor from the list and select Edit.... the dialog box will edit.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then with clicking OK the list of the static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be activated in a & sole.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetwork.com is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & KDE and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installing the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console, with rpm, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with a graphical interface can be used as a package, or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and KDE does not satisfy exclusively, but in addition, development packages are required with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended to users. however, it is not difficult, & knetworkconf; to compile it. the following commands should make this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given on basic network technology, in the second will all be discussed by & knetworkconf; change configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information is communicated on the integration of the PCs into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). N5 has never found big dissemination. IPv6 is expected in the near future. this description is therefore focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is aware of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, am & eg; works is the network administrator to be allocated or if available, DHCP can not be used. definitely, the IP address can not be freely chosen!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specially-reserved area to avoid IP addressing of the global (internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, so any use of any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks mainly addresses are used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called Standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is needed for the IP redirection.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 assigned to one's so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files, which are operated by & knetworkconf, are located and where they are placed in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed at DSL connections, so it is then no surprise when in case of active DSL connections, there is a different content to find there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by scripts in SuSEconcage. another stand as expected may occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat, is a security program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the ability to create several archives on a tape. the first goal was to provide a surface for tar, which presented my wife: how much longer does it take if you secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be integrated from & kdat. it can happen on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& concdat; cleat the band back and reads the pretensioning information of the band. recognizes & concdat, the spell on the tape do not, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & concdat, the pre-spell, search for the appropriate index on your record. can't be found, you will be asked if the tape index is to be reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol appears for the tape drive to indicate that the band was integrated. in the Status Bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the bananas, initially, the integration needs to be solved. there are three methods to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2899">& Cordat, gives a change of symbol to the band to recognise that the bond guaranteed to the band and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar. the band can now be cast out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat, it can be used, it must be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band of band must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not have to formatted with the formatting device, it must be formatted before using the band from & kdat. floppy tape drives are usually a formatting of the tape, DAT drives, on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity, & concdat, with the formatting of the band. all data on the tape will be lost. after finishing the formatting process the tape will be automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup procedure, you need to select the secure files. it can happen on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select one file or folder in a local file tree. it is only stored this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a profile profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>

<seg id="2907">With the right mouse button, click the local file tree and select the backing up...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, the dialog opens up for backup. in this dialogue, you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you confirm the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Mark a file or folder in one of the archives in entry for the drive. it's just the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the files in an entry for the band with a bunch. only the selected files and / or sub-folders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry test....</seg>

<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, dialogue will reproduce. this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the band indexfile using the band content. this process converts all existing Indexfiles for this volume. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">Here a safety profile with the straight selected files and the default settings are created. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">According to the current work folder, according to the current work folder, the current work folder will be automatically updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, that only those files are stored in the same file system, such as the folder. folders that are located on other file systems, can be inserted separately under backup files. each entry is tar independent from the other.</seg>

<seg id="2926">The file's name, which is used to determine the changes since the last increst backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files are; and lt; lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up your settings via the KDat menu... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be made:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device node for the tape drive (usually / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transfers & kdat, before the tape is integrated into the drive. in some drives, this is necessary to be performed before read or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, it tries & be dat, to lock the throw at tape drive. possibly, this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when loosing the integration of & kdat, the band automatically cast out. do not use this option at floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, tries & be dat; the hardwary block size for the tape drive is to change. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & be dat, in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat, a band formatted, writing it a file to the start of the band. this file should only prove a memory block on the band. the file's content is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The tape ID. the format of this string is host name: seconds, where computers are the complete name of the system, which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has passed since the era in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar - archives created directly with & GNU / - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incorrect fuses.</seg>

<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer does in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system installs the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog offers users with quick access to information about problems that will appear on their server. & ksystemlog, therefore, tries to provide some enhanced features, using whose help the protocol files are filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a range of useful features. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included, and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; functions are provided with their help to easily filter and sort the single protocol-rows of a protocol-file. the individual options for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup & ksandsetlog, first the most important protocol-file system - the system protocol can be started, so you don't have a small copy of the system, so you don't have a system restarting right. the protocol files are usually found in folder / var / log, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or pursuant to the filter bar. the list of the log lines will be displayed automatically, so that only log lines will display on the filter. in the default setting, a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns contain the string of the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another post on this site. select the string of the filter search term only with entries in the file system protocol, and enter in addition to the filter bar the name of a process, so show you & ksandlog; all protocol lines are sent by this process or created.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you identify the important protocol lines. protocol-lines of level error are displayed with a conspicable color as a protocol-lines of the stage note. the colour display of protocol-lines can be switched on setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display certain process only (for example, in system protocol or in cron protocol), you can then be useful if you want to investigate the issue of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window, to view all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemic; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate basement windows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage an additional window, select a protocol from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website to http: / / ksandlog.forum software software.org Dort you will find further information about the source code by & ksandular;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog, you can also find in the following folder of the & KDE; version of Subversion: ksystemlog; in & KDE;</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also so named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init rapidly develops to the standard for control the start-up of the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and even more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go to historical aspects here (since I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to set a machine on System V Init without any reinstallation and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel will first look under / etc after an init file. that's why you must make sure the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. there you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you want to run on the system or change to another Runlevel. system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services does not include such things like setserial ports, which will only be started. such calls are to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should go on / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also want to run a rc.conf / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for several places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see the following line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre-set Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can repair any / etc / inittab by hand and then you can repair it out by restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start now all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l enter in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry is link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops init actually system services? quite simple: any of the scripts is written so that it is an argument like startup and stop. you can actually start this scripts from hand on command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K includes, the script will stop with the argument. if it includes an S, the script will be called the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way to build machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running server, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & cdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another hand device is simple to say not trivial: simply draw one entry from the area of Available system services to one of the six runners to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can shift scripts between Runleveln or change the position within one level by removing it somewhere else. this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the area of Available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are postponed when you move them into a new area. in order to insert them only on a new track, you need to insert into the context menu, and insert into the target range -- even if the same entry exists earlier in the target sector.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must process the sorting numbers of the umbering entries before attempting to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown in the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to enable the various working ranges (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) and the cursor keys to make a selection - or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another lap level, move it into clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired Runlevel with insert (using Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change sorting or the name of a entry manually, press the input key to change the properties dialog. use the dialog by renewal of the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. alternatively, the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) are available if they are available. otherwise, they will be saved by & ksysv. changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I've talked with the Standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts continually. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the lilo -Prompt linux single and press the input key to restart in single-use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should usually be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I've provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they will not be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you have to edit additional files in / etc that are present only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, such as system services will be launched in these distributions, it simplified the configuration of proprietary development programmes, but is not standard for the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (eg & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply without message if your configuration files are not provided or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The significance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel, so that this manual may be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it's sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save them. either use the corresponding icon of the tool bar or entry onto the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window is made of two flashcards, user and user guidance. to edit the desired users or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears in the dialog user or group features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only represented if you have extended system settings. only if you have enabled Systemslimitations (Quota) for users, a card card is generated on which you can make individual settings. additional card cards appear, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD unixen.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card pass password will appear if shadow passwords, or for example, / etc / master.passwd, as in BSD columns, are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least one embedded file system (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quotas user / quota.group on the file system). here, for any user parameters, the limit constraints are subject to data in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected with a record restriction on the field.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card details informs about the user's admittances of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, is in the field of primitive group. furthermore, users can join in other groups by mark these in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features a list includes a list of users. to add a user to the group, mark these users in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select the user or group menu or click on the appropriate Add button on the tool bar. editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can add the lilo boat managers, remove, remove and change the period up to the boats of the standard operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change, change and more.</seg>
