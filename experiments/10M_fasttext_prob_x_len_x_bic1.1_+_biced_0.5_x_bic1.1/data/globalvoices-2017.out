although I visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extremely big .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , American authors have danced , American authors and operated with sports .
indeed , this country had a so @-@ called profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of a American film .
when 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less reporter who had uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spiracy by Julia Roberts as Jura @-@ Stud@@ i , who wanted to occupy his interest in the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if it &apos;s absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA was further strengthened .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I ever lived with its diversity so inviting , that you are always the one you are and it is easily Ac@@ cept@@ ance within a community of con@@ vent people .
I even had a very shy love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about the int@@ oler@@ ance and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me , how he goes with his narrow @-@ minded .
he never believes in his opinion just behind the mountain , as it is so beautiful .
he says exactly what he is considering , as a former colleague put it , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and Women .
nevertheless , people responded to his testim@@ onies and approved in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won with Republican Presi@@ dential elections was the highest number who ever reached a nominated candidate .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this authenti@@ cal person , I asked ?
I could not tune Tr@@ ump and elec@@ tors with people who I had met in Phoenix during my time .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , takes up the people from around the world , a deeply believing man , with whom I managed to enter@@ tain me about Islam and his past .
also Tr@@ um@@ ps did not agree with the world@@ view of Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity which I experienced at Sandy B@@ ahr , who experienced her life for the environment and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
it still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who helped me with much patience and wor@@ m@@ wood and my colleagues , to get used to the complexity of the American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice has helped me a lot in my career .
these people and those by they em@@ bodied values deep@@ ened my love in America .
while Tr@@ ump led his way to the nominated Republican Presi@@ dential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part of its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out to be the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans gave the presidency to a man , although - or maybe because of his contemp@@ t toward non @-@ white people .
the con@@ frontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either against rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , broke almost the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to call Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a rac@@ ist .
to arrange people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and respec@@ tful and imp@@ lies an in@@ ability to understand those who deal with another way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes are not taken into account in their communities .
could it be that these elec@@ tors , of which the most knows , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to win control over a country they are disappointed ?
in other words , would they possibly say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the fierce decision to raise a man who look down with contemp@@ t upon those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . WC . : as much as &quot; rebellion of white against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; ; wor@@ d@@ play from white to white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones named , exactly what America has done so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether the myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which faith or background you like , America is always welcome .
because this country has chosen as its President , twice the son of a ken@@ ian@@ ers , whose story as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
but with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with complexity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at rest , say they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who is in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
as a demonstration for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd &apos;s crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , &quot; son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ aring the crowd .
&quot; did Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your US ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they shou@@ ted and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a consistent and loud &quot; NE@@ IN ! &quot;
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; God is thanks to Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land which his son had fallen , sent a message .
now that is Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and it breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ian town of Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
the music that is played on both places , not only the life of children has changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music , who lives with the tr@@ ash
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds apart from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for a couple of years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica Audit@@ orium ( music band ) in the village : one of the children and adults of existing Symphony Orchestra , which has found an opportunity for over@@ coming her poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , located in one of the poo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and the B@@ anden Viol@@ ence .
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had so rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come and play with shining eyes and play in the gu@@ ile you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , ti@@ mp@@ ani , bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from Mü@@ hl@@ ander
more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically above the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital of Paraguay - on instruments which are made of re @-@ transfer@@ ed waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments which consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling of Fa@@ vio Chávez began to turn parts of the waste in instruments .
instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ ins , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all manufactured from the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an , Latin American music and the music of the Beatles , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Chávez re@@ members a local ec@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura :
first , it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the children had no music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something that he never had seen before : one made of tr@@ ash made violin .
today , there is an entire orchestra appearing on instruments made of re @-@ prepared material and that the Recy@@ cled Orchestra is called .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the trouble - like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectac@@ le of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .

it was known in West Africa that this ship had already been operated in Liberia &apos;s waters of illegal fishing before it was searching for the other African coast .
the East African countries were about to be applied accordingly , and much incl@@ ined to welcome the seeds of this species at its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ ore , Mozambique and the Seychelles &quot; mobil@@ ised quickly against the ship . they refused to buy one of their har@@ bours and refused to lend him a fishing permits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u &quot; rec@@ alls a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing agency . it is part of a team that discovered the ship back in time and followed .
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch a fish there .
ultimately it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia for a pre@@ dation of the country &apos;s stocks .
the core of this initiative that crosses a criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illeg@@ ally Fishing ( stop Il@@ legal F@@ isheries ) .
members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar , six countries who then had driven the Premier out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden when it is extremely difficult to track . that &apos;s illegal fishing a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions .
by intenti@@ onal mis@@ regard of existing laws which are supposed to be protected by certain habit@@ ats and types , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may harm a delicate balance .
however , during actions against illegal fishing once were ham@@ per@@ ed by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les and through the snow @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions now happen in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange , for example , lists any existing licenses , news for susp@@ icious activity or details that you notice or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , when they move on the open sea , with satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships which fishing in banned areas - such as susp@@ icious driving routes - such as those who point out that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
in the ideal situation , such examinations may show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the way and possibly , whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing , on the basis of these information , can refuse to accept such ships in their har@@ bours . what does the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that even numbers of pen@@ alties could be forced , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a representative firm that assi@@ sts for illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenues , which lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year due to illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing industry , which attracts the region of commercial fishing in around the world . among these also one such illegal fishermen .
among other things , actions include like sailing under false flag , fake license papers , indication of ph@@ antom species , fish protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this legal si@@ p@@ flo@@ k tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects .
it has exposed against crimin@@ als , which revealed counterfeit licenses in Tanzania . there were ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found wings and found refuge .
due to his collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for fighting crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; some of our investigations have led us quite far into the networks of organis@@ ational crimes , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system that is supposed to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ icious ships in detail .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evol@@ ving , helps reduce the illegal ships to hide .
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , Chef analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO also deals with f@@ isheries data and technical support .
some of the ships turn off their automated identification systems , such as they can no longer be ort@@ et by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different information systems . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally ag@@ ating ships with a bigger precision .
a model program
but may F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations indeed take effect on the un@@ question@@ ably global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch Platform . it offers a platform that offers satellite data , and through which the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship can be displayed worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get a better picture of what you do - this makes sense &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ led their resources for the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project running on which a global system provides tracking of ships .
there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel crime , but also deter them .
ships that had been over@@ f@@ ished without license and hard with consequences , now know that they are watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries participating at F@@ ISH @-@ i have now accounted for a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , they found inspec@@ tors there on board slo@@ pp@@ nets , whose use is prohibited .

other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will disappear several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing every year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries gathered together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . however , they now also fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security , the goal is to develop even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;@@ s recently announced its first major triumph in October : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under a false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used to@@ dd@@ le@@ nets which are meanwhile banned .
the ship was also prohibited in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such special , collabor@@ ative way to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world sea .

the street movements in Venezuela seems to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are considered protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum for the sen@@ sion of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the Government of Venezuela has rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a counter@@ part , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans responded to negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in their eyes , having gathered themselves on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the order of Venezuela ) can be found both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the region Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva .
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , what makes it noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans by an acute lack of food and drugs .
many representatives of the Opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the pre@@ building of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately , the de@@ position of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting in Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government statement as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and ge@@ ck@@ akes belong to the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far reaching lack of food and medicine was to give the country the chance to rebuild his institutional structures and join a new government alliance .
the electoral political alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( approximately : round table of the Democratic Party ) linked to the elections of 2015 to the majority of representatives of the National Assembly . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on Tort@@ get@@ ag and a march to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezuel@@ an government , should continue to pass on November 3 .
the call was stated on Twitter among other things as follows :

on Twitter , images that talk about disp@@ utes , as well as reports from oppression and abuse .
especially great waves beat the report on police repression in the central @-@ located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
protest@@ ers return to the local cathedral there , to protect themselves according to their own testimony before the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira bear no skirts , because you could see something that many National Park didn &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an Inf@@ ographic makes the round , which det@@ ects the magn@@ itude of supp@@ ression per day :
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a counter@@ balance procedure - this has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless men on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs are :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are fake .
here is your counter@@ part !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that made a little against the devastating economic crisis from their perspective , and would rather be dealing with critical voices :
they have taken us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches are always taking more in frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ tians reported the media , they were hungry for participating in a strike , instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano who was originally released on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argentine news page .
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to visit the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said in the province of Cordoba in the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in Córdoba , towards his father .
in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined that were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano hasn &apos;t visited his life .
starting with the burden , same name as his father , to bear the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years , he retained his family secrets to himself .
in the situation at that time , I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
when child is 15 years old , you don &apos;t know that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not recognize that my father was a thief , a fol@@ er , and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father of 1976 to 1978 was a deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , who was charged for kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent about his child , and how this child chose a path of salvation .
of the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me up to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was fried with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts .
all they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an ass@@ hole , you have been friends with one of the ERP .
passport just doesn &apos;t want you to escape a day and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation of ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be obe@@ yed .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . my father had brought me up .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&apos; then the prisoners are subjected to torture &apos;
my father took me four times at La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small piece of cr@@ isp@@ bread and ordered me to wear it into a car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a big cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day , I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with an out@@ post .
suddenly he pointed out into an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I was paraly@@ zed , and saw a lying , tortured on man .
she looked like a dirt and metal springs .
later I found out that they attach it to an end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body &apos;s body , which was sp@@ elt right there .
they grab@@ bed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ thrown him with water and ch@@ ased a cargo of 220 volts to gen@@ itals .
photo : com@@ is@@ i@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the smell there was horri@@ ble ... as a dirty wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father started to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore it .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a Ci@@ vili@@ an who was also indicted on the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses , on which naked people lay down with the face down - all were bound at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people were silent on the matt@@ resses .
when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; Why do you look like , ass@@ hole ? &quot;
I met &quot; Why didn &apos;t you brought me out ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and was killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me home .
besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms known as offices .
I know &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed .
( according to information from survivors of the civil , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of trial in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , the student of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in at here is also the way where the kid@@ nap@@ pers came here .
when you look on the map , you can see that they took about these steps and tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of de@@ classified a number .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the above came , that they should be re@@ located .
this was the lie - Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War of war &apos;
my father brought all kinds stolen things .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but as I was later when the military was , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military signs which one receives one enemy that is fought against .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano with his son .
archive recording
but if you enter into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... boots , then that &apos;s no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I was always asked how my father , the leader of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I said : and you whom you beat on the road ?
you are no crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded anger , struck me , and cried , saying ,
when you go so far , I will find you and embrace you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
that &apos;s my father .
I have no one good memory to him .
as I said in the process , I showed a photo of at that time , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense accused me to have been a fellow liter@@ al of this crime . I answered , no problem , they can lay mine on what they wanted .
I was there , anyway , to cut off .
&apos;@@ En@@ forced Dis@@ appearances &quot; is the last un@@ ob@@ sc@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you only have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
so good . so , during the dictatorship of the dictatorship , you have van@@ ished . but what did the bodies disappear ?
why kids carry out children ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
you could not have been able to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families who could have passed their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the dead is the last ab@@ b@@ ous act , which one can do to man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners .
they were ma@@ stered and somewhere involved , no idea where . &quot; you never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains of course .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought , to indicate my Father , was created during a meeting , when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience him for him .
he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
I felt contempl@@ ative and wonder@@ ing , what the whole sta@@ id patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly engaged , actually were good .
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed aw@@ ful crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
he just answered , &quot; Now I show me . &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a crimin@@ als .
no one can throw me that I am vo@@ ke . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 at the end of the trial .
he was charged for 416 crimes : among them heavier , un@@ just@@ i@@ ated freedom of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 years of child .

after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended with crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 .
43 patients were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court ruled out of life sentences and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were fre@@ es .
eleven of the originally 54 accused died during the trial .

all the def@@ endants were during the dictatorship of the military , including former members of military , former police officers and civil employees .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidnapped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the wel@@ d Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the tribunal is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years in justice for victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , who became a member of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who became a member of the children of people , who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the process took more than three years , but research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government transferred the country on which La Per@@ la was able to build a memorial place there , which is now managed by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fear@@ less drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a Kyoto centre in which you can extend his driving licence .
the photograph was distributed in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence in the last month , witnesses of a very particularly failed translation .
in a sign the Japanese word ( ko@@ rei@@ un@@ ten@@ sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means , fal@@ sely - maybe also with a Boh@@ em@@ ian background thanks &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; horri@@ ble car driver . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1 @-@ 20 .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was in common in the social media .
the error was the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also , who made his attention to the local artist lo@@ ids .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n daily negotiated the Kyoto protocol :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
this is an ins@@ ult for elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; Holmes said .
the in@@ correct English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; ( German : &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; ) was later replaced by the more reasonable , although gramm@@ atically not entirely correct designation &quot; El@@ der Dri@@ vers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) was replaced .
the police in Kyoto has been ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , it explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had been found from trans@@ lators that the translation was not checked to their accuracy .
a blo@@ gger was reported as follows the exc@@ use :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt by in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) in our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News was somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; horri@@ ble &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan apart and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ oun@@ cing as an in@@ appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police , the proportion of older motor@@ ists , who are involved in accidents , is quite worried .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors . this represents a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , seniors 1.@@ 8@@ 03 caused a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
thus their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents fell in total , the proportion of seniors caused accidents has risen in the same period .
the rep@@ utable rep@@ orters offered in the published version of the article comments on the light that show the pre@@ judi@@ ces a few Japanese seem@@ ingly against older motor@@ ists :
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors , among others , received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fear@@ less drivers &quot; ) about reality ? &quot;
- &quot; so err@@ one@@ ous is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a true translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all of Asia .
En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true mine of the bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of trans@@ lators are varied .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the output text and learn active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active command of target language - something that is in the mother &apos;s speakers . in general , the persu@@ as@@ ion that trans@@ lators should be in the initial language - not in the language language .
thus , a French native language should translate by English into French , not from the French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ employees with English as a mother tongue that could make translations into English . this may lack a lack of understanding for the over@@ taking , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of English speakers that are to be Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees can make translations still fir@@ s . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is ranked as the best , become a translator , no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ al and myst@@ i@@ fying phr@@ ases that are created by machine translation is shown that this technique can still not replace human trans@@ lators for a long time . this applies to several languages entirely .
some of the stran@@ gest English forums in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic pres@@ sur@@ ings that often use t @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for sty@@ list@@ ically reasons - not to be read or understood even .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry or at least harmless . however , of big companies or from the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto uses hopefully a serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and interest to take on the internet and television
Home of the portal &quot; Nav@@ ses con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y So@@ c@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
Friday morning , April 7 , the Venezuel@@ an Internet user used to have no access to the online transmitter Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later , another user wrote that Internet dis@@ appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV are also no longer available .
other online channels also contributed to the record of the protests in Caracas that were organised by op@@ positi@@ onal groups that resist the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court themselves .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the findings of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is curved , and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites Venezuel@@ an providers closed again .
this is from the site of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers as Viv@@ op@@ lay is popular among the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ians with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ itated by reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the commission for telecommunications have threatened with fin@@ es and closure , when the Commission continued to report this as &quot; appeal to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing , that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ IN fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also affects the website where the National Assembly transfers their meetings .
former research institutes of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local Internet service providers can be able to vac@@ ate DNS . in this case , it concerns a technology which in@@ correctly answer the DNS servers of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server uses in@@ correct or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ ad@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transfer was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res , who carried out the protest in Caracas to be taken in prison .
Flo@@ res was beaten while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also announced that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections , so the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ians will always make access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slave to get an apprentices@@ hip
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita child . now she visits the house where she worked for many years .
today Tina is strug@@ gling for children and collect testim@@ oni@@ als of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas who were just like they were victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use of Cur@@ tains of Cur@@ tur@@ us .
the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report of tur@@ m@@ ics , by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly auth@@ orization of the authors published .
the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , falling schools &quot; ) organized by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a budget in which she had not allowed to eat together with the family that was allowed to eat .
shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
those who have become something , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . when Cri@@ ad@@ itas is known as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a big family with a little money transfer their min@@ ors &apos; son or her under@@ age daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , an apprentices@@ hip and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to offer countless days of household work that will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse , and all this in the framework of a contract you cannot raise .
this practice , called Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of its involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite the symptoms of human rights organisations .
after her graduation , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she talked with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - collected witness , rep@@ lied and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call the things given by name , as the feeling of gratitude is vacc@@ inated by the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , but in general silence shall not be silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
on the other hand , the family that their daughter is in the faith that they conclude their education , improving their position in society and &quot; something out of itself &quot; can be handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family that over@@ takes the girl with itself and just@@ ifies the exploitation by faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise be no training , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will be experienced many years later .
sometimes they never experienced .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the un@@ seen in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of severe dro@@ ings . shortly afterwards , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military group Tom@@ ás Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official for residents .
Mar@@ ín was living in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants and 250 kilometers east of As@@ unci@@ on .
Fer@@ reira , ended in late January 2016 with a stick on Mar@@ ín until they suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment of the young girl &apos;s life .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the child was Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply responsible in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society of the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as a &quot; modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest together , asking that there could be no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; mour@@ ned Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to inj@@ ure the rights of children .
without official documents it &apos;s very difficult to control , among which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of married couples and almost 60 civil society organisations requested an independent investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was Cri@@ ad@@ ita , to 30 years in prison .
if the case is before the Court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín will be landmark - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go before judgment .
everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k worked in which her father worked to register , and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to go all work and began to sell , on the street or on the market sweets , to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent when Cri@@ ad@@ ita was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that it was still time for learning .
it stood every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
on Fri@@ days for example , clean the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground .
when the school was at an end , she returned home and had time for learning .
the more they worked together with learning , the more free time she had .

Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to take more books from the library of the House@@ hold as food from the refrigerator , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the house@@ holder , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who had been in power from 1954 to 1989 .

in doing so , he tried to convince her to grant the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator of the dict@@ ator .

&quot; they don &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would again learn &quot; bad habits , &quot; that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would speak their mother tongue to Guar@@ ani .
their Lord feared that she would have enabled her to lose , she explains .
she was completely clear , however , that she had paid for everything she had paid for them with her hard work .
even in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about , mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans are exposed to those Cri@@ ad@@ itas , when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I didn &apos;t have friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt especially clear that I was one of the group .

the company cheap the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share career opportunities for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s girl in Paraguay .
the administrative director of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ we@@ an@@ ovsky , a city council in As@@ unci@@ on .
Hi ! I &apos;m looking for a little friend for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
learning how to learn .
please call you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Lik@@ es &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a young girl and gave their telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , provided her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very attractive , &quot; she wrote .
the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inner inner court that wants to work . &quot;
then the author of the ad switched itself once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I watch if it works with it .
thank you very much , I am writing again if something is .
the business was completed .
in the Pro@@ log of the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long nor ? ) , a collection of witness testim@@ onies given by former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ada@@ z@@ go ( a practice of early history ) , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ado@@ res who gave them tribute to the Spanish conqu@@ erer in Paraguay , and the Spanish conqu@@ erer in which the Spanish conqu@@ erer had to settle in a system of slavery , in which they become easy victim to abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go .
bill proposes Egypt users social media to register with the government
picture by Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian Parliament approved a draft bill to agree with regulations regarding the use of the use of social networks . &quot;
if he is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt by a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law then a place would then be set up to explo@@ it civil rights and citizens to share social media .
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register with their correct name and identity numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do this , it may have a punishment of up to six months in jail or a fine of money .
the bill , consisting of six par@@ agra@@ phs , consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defined social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which is running via the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video monitoring and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is passed when it is accepted , as Egyptian authorities have no indication to im@@ pose the user &apos;s users , not to register with the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is unable to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , Parliament of Parliament and promot@@ er of the Legisl@@ ative Law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and users supported a user name and a password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to set a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those of the Egyptians , it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it has so far not known that such plans consist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( German &quot; Senior Research &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian Initiative &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I double in the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have technology to do with technology .
in my opinion , they make it so clear that just as they keep for@@ ci@@ bly physical public and private spaces that could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , this means that they are implementing a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who require auth@@ orization or do not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them a trial process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative elections and the Constitutional Committ@@ ees , before it comes to the debate .
whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement will be successful or not , the design is in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ kt@@ y proposed a legislative case against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long sentence for those who were intended to be found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

a sub@@ species of the larger family of the Leop@@ ards created by Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are between 800 and 1000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to wild grapes , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they always find less lo@@ ot , endangered .
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the increase of the ecos@@ ystem , depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards in the wild wild is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore stipul@@ ates that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera &apos;s all , breaks R@@ aza in pure joy .

documented in early March 2017 , the newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o carried out the progress made in the last six years to re@@ building the life of the &quot; thre@@ e@@ fold disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fukus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture , in Japan , had to experience the earthquake and resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring farms of Fukus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to vac@@ ate , because the tsun@@ ami had van@@ ished entire coastal cities from the map .
even more , Fukus@@ hima pre@@ fecture had one nuclear disaster in the Fukus@@ hima pre@@ fecture , only some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows a local view which progres@@ sed over six years later to re@@ building the life of local people .
the detailed report of the newspaper covers both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and a survey results of the victims themselves .
the housing situation in Fukus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare @-@ houses ( rule , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fukus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the greatest achievement among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . here , 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fukus@@ hima still represents the final light with 70 percent .
even though , six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ el &apos;s accomod@@ ations ( by rule , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) , were still trying to settle in final spare houses .
after the thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes .
in December 2016 there still lived 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fukus@@ hima still live in an emergency , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful in 2011 . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated living after the des@@ aster were settled in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the status of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 visited 1,@@ 100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune , its gates until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation again , 30 percent of the fishing ports have recovered their operations in Fukus@@ hima .
the tsun@@ ami and the nuclear issue , have caught a large scale in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fukus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear waste , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of cultivated farm@@ land from Fukus@@ hima , are in the &quot; nuclear waste zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures the tourism has continuously recovered , but here again Fukus@@ hima remains far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back up to 90 percent on the same level as before mis@@ fortune . Fukus@@ hima , on the other hand , there can only be 75 percent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of coastal inhabitants , it has been more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next major qu@@ akes ?
to obtain a complete picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and under the evacu@@ ated by . she questioned them about the status of reconstruction and also how their reception has changed over the tsun@@ ami @-@ risk .
in her introduction of the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami @-@ awareness among native people living in experience .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local people have taken action taken in order to be prepared on future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents find that it was still not enough in the disasters associated with disasters .
as it stands for those who had evacu@@ ated from the Fukus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has ampli@@ fied its attention also to the location of the evacu@@ ated from Fukus@@ hima .
Fukus@@ hima still had to experience only the enormous earthquake and devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fukus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was witness of the worst , cat@@ astro@@ phic caused , nuclear waste that has ever had to experience in Japan .
almost 63 000 people from Fukus@@ hima from Fukus@@ hima were transferred to almost 63 000 people in the area outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , there were more than 23 000 people , back to Fukus@@ hima and had been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent replacement parts .
still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukus@@ hima still live outside of their home pre@@ fecture in 2017 .
in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es areas most of the evacu@@ ees , still more than 50 years old , are known because the efforts to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fukus@@ hima with massive construction projects . here , it is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , one recognizes however often that one more un@@ ites than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important because they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely related these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat issues that often get less attention in the reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly associated with someone about speech and country borders .

left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva looked at a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was given this week into an intensive care unit : last Friday a police officer was defeated at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia in a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide , millions of protest@@ ers took part in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Univers@@ it@@ ität of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him this Saturday and have now translated it into an artificial coma .
his state is regarded as crit@@ ically .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly rapidly spread in Brazil during a few days .
on the pictures there is also the face of the police officers , which was attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ a@@ io .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ a@@ io was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , with his impact stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
a police officer would beat from a demonstr@@ ators and land on intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , who sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and put a number of sanctions on it .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in the social networks .
in the clip shown below , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus down from the 50th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) in order to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in the memory of Go@@ i@@ ás .
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here , the Activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered here , because he was stab@@ bed to crimin@@ alise the Occup@@ y Movement in Sec@@ ond@@ ary School . and now we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , who was attacked by a polic@@ emen who had attacked him with a stroke stock .
police convic@@ tions
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only country in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations last Friday .
polic@@ emen set at protests in the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators wanted a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to aband@@ on violence against protest@@ ers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again the Brazilian media street protests conf@@ uses to focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disk .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a cervical glass windows to illustr@@ ate their title pages illustr@@ ative .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more than a broken window disk than the protests of thousands of people who serve a special cause .
this is necessary to recognize if one is strictly damage to any form of damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is a absurd , disp@@ ro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are communic@@ ated by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on the con@@ frontation with the police . &quot;
dra@@ fting of the Dis@@ crimin@@ alisation of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , there were almost hundreds of sugar production factories throughout Cuba . ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - un@@ aware that there is no notable sugar @-@ harvest on site .
it is two years ago , when the activities were placed in the sugar production factories .
after the earthquake the sugar industry was still in the region , and the factory lost gradually after its plants , until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some changed the work .
others signed and comm@@ ute one daily to the factories that are still burning .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ a veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis is not rob@@ bed of the sugar industry .
he heard that there are sugar @-@ factories in the east of the region , which are back in operation after a long period of time because they were given .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would get the sugar oil factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar industry subsi@@ sts in pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ suffici@@ ency , the bad administration decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity .
the news would have been a motive for the country for a few decades ago , but the bad har@@ v@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar industry switched off ?
the old train station in the village saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar tubes were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly more competitive they were in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for the most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar prices rose from about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sug@@ ars will remain in pounds between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 survey from the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; the day of today &apos;s day will go into history &quot; - these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
during the following years , the breast@@ feeding of 98 cane mill factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar tubes factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene is known as soldier is known about the closure of the factory , the word that he repe@@ ats the most , &quot; betra@@ yal . &quot;
almost all respondents say the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group .
before the initial publication , the first letters began to come .
it was un@@ written documents , which only differ@@ ed in terms of parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , but only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was transferred and the letters came becoming more common .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was in charge for the breast@@ feeding factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still operating sugar production factories , &quot; he insured .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the breast@@ feeding of the factory , where the construction he helped , took part .
with each part he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and its most important job generators was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases there were no alternatives for working and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , then the then president in the eyes of those present people saw when he assured that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation since five years .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar production factories
the sugar cane has been extracted only highly since 2004 .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the People &apos;s Con@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i lear@@ ns that many things change , but not getting better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar factory completed , or even better , when they began to end it , they also stopped to as@@ sign the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not used to supply the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty harvest@@ ing the old soldiers a du@@ ck of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al .
Mr N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is not a thou@@ ght@@ ful person , yet he gives the lies that one told him not .
they have tor@@ ment it for ten years .
he goes to retirement age of 65 , not because he is lacking in force , but because he is bitter@@ ness .

you@@ ths from the first Nations communities in the whole of Canada deals with topics that are important for them . they do not do with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
since 2014 , as part of the N &apos; we Jin@@ an @-@ tour , workshops are direct to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups , song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were directed by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in northern Quebec in ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Gruppe The North@@ stars .
the workshop adv@@ ances that the young people talks in discussions like &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever is happening in the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o , in the field of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ mon@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , explains the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; on which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women have disappeared or murdered .
the cases were not fully explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to con@@ vey how important is preser@@ vation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences through the glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in Indi@@ genous languages , although the young@@ sters have not always rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ oth@@ oo@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people involved a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly von der North@@ stars Hip Hop Group , who gave them a verse in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well as translation into English , translated into German here :
sometimes I feel , nobody would ever be interested in me
but I &apos;m trying to go further my days on earth
that &apos;s the day you will lose our cry
because we lost our way to life in our life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and lead our youth as well
so they can do that , what the Creator has determined
in the commentary part of the reader and dis@@ col@@ ate of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution to the verse in Sil@@ van@@ ic ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission to be released ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan it can be seen in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers , what exactly is on the menu , will be found near the entrance of the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( by rule , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) from each dish that will be served in this restaurant .
customers are looking at these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of this plastic dishes .
in the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes , which the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese are these plastic dishes so usually that they do not even notice them . a new trend is turning today in consp@@ ic@@ uous mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
in Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ k san@@ it@@ u .
now on sale : new with plastic dishes decorative chains , like they will be shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food were turned to kit@@ sch@@ y colle@@ cti@@ bles , as in this case , refriger@@ ated mag@@ nets :
here are some sho@@ cks refriger@@ ated mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the ess@@ ences has increasingly become more elabor@@ ate .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone support .
this part is also made for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an Apple who holding your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the cell phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of a growing flight into the county .
some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon s@@ als is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
is there anybody who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can get my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also receive a less appetite , for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleas@@ antly surprised .
our latest cell phone stand has the shape of mel@@ mel@@ ts ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , Ear@@ rings and hand@@ leb@@ ars from dried salmon .
further com@@ ical plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter on the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 .
if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is devoted to popular restaurant industry . for example , with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survi@@ ving of fighting against the organised crime
&quot; for the sacrifice of fighting against the drug dealers . &quot;

in reports from domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against the drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico , the mi@@ sts and gear@@ ings regularly show up only in statistics . however , this reflects the extent of human tragedy that brings this struggle with itself .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the boss of Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , urged the stories of the conflict entirely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looking for the people who have learned to live with pain .
behind every body , behind each bone , in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds may never heal .
this is why the Mexican news portal animal pol@@ í@@ tico has set up the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug dealers living ) , &quot; the victims are supposed to have a voice and told stories of people involved in the struggle between prosec@@ utions and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the imp@@ lications are much deeper .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and all municipalities have to leave many kilometers , to buy something like milk as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guad@@ alu@@ pe , a father that dig@@ ging secret tom@@ bs every weekend after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father by only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ w .
Pri@@ est : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task again today that we have asked to go and to graves , after the people we loved we are looking for . &quot;
Guad@@ alu@@ pe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 , he left the house .
on October 15th he was back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I &apos;m now alone with three children who need an apprentices@@ hip .
my mother , too , is my mother , too .
at the moment she has no income .
you are entitled to my father &apos;s insurance , but it does not pay them out because there is a death certificate .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explains why the project is so important :
we must not only demonstrate the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility , and the government .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , regardless of what it occurs :
I have seen the disease and sens@@ orial journ@@ alism now for a few years now .
I come over to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with pictures , which actually only can come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or ac@@ adem@@ ics of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes , I feel like I am the only one who joined or sad . it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be either valid , or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old C@@ ousin thinks he is Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is great . and it is also not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me , that , as if they would have lost those who have lost someone , and those who fear that they are also something like that .
I see our weakness , if stories are to be exposed numbers in a statistic .
the in@@ action of mankind is incredible for me when death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbour that they are justified &quot; were justified . &quot;
I think they are trying to argue that they are sp@@ ared from such trage@@ dies , when they are not stir@@ red and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months Ex@@ press@@ ations in the main city : &quot; it describes how armed det@@ ective month spent money from their business until they were destroyed by the end not only the business but also their family apart .
you think about everything you lost , and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further , away from each other , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will de@@ duct you or kill you .
I asked myself in these dre@@ ad@@ ful days if even weeping would dissolve my deep root emotions , but the answer is no , because I don &apos;t forget how to weep . I must learn to live with pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Bryan is a mad@@ ness that he had to teach himself how to make a egg , potatoes , tortillas , keep warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that make with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ acon with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
however , they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - in@@ descri@@ b@@ able to a boy for all life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody dead body of his father saw that had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez did look like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 , when violence was ming@@ led by the organised crime and struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings on public safety and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office ( 3@@ 103 murders ) numbered between 8.5 murders per day .
these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter the soul of the country .
only few stories living in the face of becoming the new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; the objective of data journ@@ alism @-@ project Sp@@ co@@ dat@@ i in 2015 , whose goal consists to depic@@ t the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades , in a comprehen@@ sible way .
when one image is worth a thousand un@@ real words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Viking ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the sides of which he links , include images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment that it is about to raise a rum@@ or , or to de@@ bunk a fake .
but how is the years after something appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , incl@@ ined to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) seven years ago .
since its first release , it was used ir@@ regul@@ ating , trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology by Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - deny not the fact that there is abundant coverage of events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria .
however , we ask questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a road tan@@ ker entered the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped and explo@@ ded . 230 people were killed .
after the Civil War , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been negle@@ cted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became ag@@ grav@@ ated full of whi@@ st@@ holes that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , he fell victim to the tank .
la@@ den@@ ial representatives described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ ops dozens of houses including a movie nearby , which was full of people who clearly illustr@@ ate the football world championship .
homes gener@@ ously camp@@ ed and scattered dead bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignor@@ ance .
a picture of the title &quot; That is Nigeria &apos; . from the Im@@ g@@ ur User Myst@@ ical Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5. more pictures of the incident form the grey scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows ranks of carbon@@ ated body , which are up@@ set on the floor while people see them .
but here the story is not its end .
over the years the same photo was pl@@ agu@@ ed by several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , though not to be attributed to the context of the trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on the 3rd of January 2015 the fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the escaped Nig@@ erian village of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically the atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were placed in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count bodies , &quot; said a man on Human Rights Watch .
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite imag@@ ery the follow @-@ up time could be displayed .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the armed conflict in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am country to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture shows the DR Congo again , as it fal@@ sely display as proof of the fact and the possible level of attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of errors ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the image was presented as a proof for mass strikes .
another step further , such as this example , fal@@ sely display the picture from DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to provide arguments .
the picture of S@@ ange also occurred in association with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who could flee the stro@@ kes , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following on which these descriptions were merged with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page , which claimed in 2012 , the president My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an has said that monks and polit@@ ician allegedly participated in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she used the image from DR Congo to view this information .
the original contribution , which was adopted last on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organisations , who called AFP as their source , were also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ an His saying , but had not taken the picture from the DR Congo in connection .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false de@@ coupling spann@@ ing up to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; you can see how far information limits can be exceeded .
a reverse picture @-@ search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found out of 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 images that are very similar to the stated picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a med@@ ley of private parties , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as : English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have been for@@ warded to false reports , some have tried to un@@ mask the forg@@ eries .
we have identified examples of the mis@@ use util@@ isation and associated with the respective countries in connection , based on what page they had been published . by this way , we want to display the range more evident than by language only .
several examples of un@@ common use can be derived from the listed lands ( which in some cases were also linked together ) .
here are some inst@@ ances that can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the most sought @-@ in countries are still available on pages or servers , about the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing , or fal@@ se@@ hood , are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing examples .
remember@@ ing , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City does not only believe the disin@@ formation , but also discuss the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions about the int@@ entions of persons and the involved trage@@ dies ( DRC and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los c@@ rist@@ ian@@ os &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .

La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica cited as his source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where not known is whether the original report included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
funny contributions after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am like this here , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; have seen quite clearly no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that contradic@@ ts this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the in@@ correct use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then by a post @-@ American , anti @-@ Islamic comm@@ it@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continue to be silent in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize winner . &quot;
this article gives attention to the continuing distress of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quoted at the work of an article by Indian Express with the image from the DR Congo ; the article of Indian Express had not included this picture at the time of the release of our post .

this page applied the picture as a proof of that Muslims killed Nig@@ erian Christians killed .
this asser@@ tion was disp@@ ro@@ ved by a gre@@ ek @-@ check @-@ page 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a association of students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims over the news agency Nas@@ im and used to illustr@@ ate the image of DR Congo .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the picture from the DR Congo was designated as proof of the strikes of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Public Deb@@ forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example for a mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand , expresses the sympathy compared to the Nig@@ erian massacre and on the other side the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the alleg@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , because the photos were used to mis@@ use .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Government of Myanmar published a question of what they have been deliberately led by international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions concerning Myanmar . &quot;
this correc@@ t@@ ance , which only appeared in English only , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that are using H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups in order to kill Muslim Budd@@ hi@@ sts and otherwise ( what is often used by bur@@ ial nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian @-@ orthodo@@ x congregation , is clear that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims to kill the Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an was claimed in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of publication , the picture will continue to include .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article by 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic site An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , expressly stated that the picture was not st@@ ems from killing , but it claims it &apos;s a &quot; similar d@@ z@@ ha@@ sty attack . &quot;
when the picture later turned into circulation with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to re@@ im@@ pose that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ d@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo di@@ pped , marked with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 massacre and to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities did those events that took possession of Islam@@ s in the name of Islam , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was disgu@@ ised as proof of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages related to them were taken in no religious context .
instead , the aim was to attract attention to the relative numbers of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message which allegedly has been written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ erian massacre in circulation , it was translated into circulation , such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to fal@@ se@@ hood .
from the message where the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ rist Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ t@@ less use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , aggreg@@ ates and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ der are also back , but are no longer tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time @-@ tim@@ est@@ amp do not exist on the web cra@@ wler and to gather information about educational names in the context of Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared until the original accident in 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description but the original fee is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that this po@@ sts pass through . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in terms of major discussions regarding the silence of Christians through Muslims or in the defence of Muslims - the murdered victims of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued at a European or French life .
religion are wanting to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth to investigate how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give this pictures longer faith .
with social media , there are ety people who have un@@ intenti@@ onally part of drinking the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ars this mood of mis@@ - and fal@@ cons , that actual atro@@ cities are in@@ true and removes the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar in Myanmar .
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that it returns to a ref@@ us@@ al to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even asked by the victims themselves .
at the same time , concern that violent images readers and viewer lear@@ ners and give them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , investigating how violent media act to help others ) .
while there are some regarding violent represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists have experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you will have to think about the situation in which a picture suggests , which is actually replaced by the context or on completely mis@@ using species .
every investigation of false assign@@ ments should also be considered as internationally they can be internationally .

a word or expression does not suff@@ ices , which is why a full explanation , and sometimes somewhat context necessary to understand what is meant by this word .
these unique words have been collected for a period of time in an online list .
most of these lists include Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on little different languages .
in Blog one finds the example words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u &apos;s language , as follows :
&quot; vac@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - draw your parents in recognition of how you stri@@ ve for your younger years .
words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the convenience or sl@@ oth you feel after being war@@ med for cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s words from his blog above :
they s@@ mu@@ ters other cultures , reveal other ideas and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you affect how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , even more of these &quot; un@@ acceptable words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treasure Languages , &quot; which are very appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka joins the worst flood catastrophe of the decade
the island nation of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and flood catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon that coinci@@ des in late May , by strong rainfall , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya entered the south and west of the country over the banks .
following a statement from the disaster of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missed because of the floods and s@@ lim@@ es .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and roughly 100 000 people were brought into 304 safe residence .
the rainfall followed on Saturday ( May 27 ) and the water stocks in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene changes in the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ appro@@ ach@@ able areas .
the following pictures and videos con@@ vey an impression of the amount of the flood catastrophe :
high tide at the Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water walls of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am ants and Sri Lanka provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods ham@@ mer@@ ed the den@@ ial crisis , save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus rose up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded through the water p@@ eg@@ els of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has made five planes for rescue actions and another five will be made for transportation of emergency supplies for the residents in their flooded villages .
various organisations and start@@ ups have also declared themselves to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high @-@ water conditions and humanitarian aid .
if you need some search and rescue teams for their operations , please call number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and food @-@ necessary goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 where animals need help in this field .
the Tax@@ ir@@ uf @-@ App pic@@ ks ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app so that the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ center will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ ical tower Ro@@ an@@ u , pic@@ ks brought me a &quot; high @-@ water aid &quot; button , which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick@@ up help from help and donations . they were then for@@ warded to the sr@@ il@@ ous Red Cross .
they also led a &quot; SOS &quot; key , which included more than thousands of en@@ quiries and 150 successful bo@@ aters for water and heating systems .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully trained , bring residents in need of safety and afford assistance in safety .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

we approved the use of the Women &apos;s March in January when I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trust her four years old daughter , she confi@@ ded to me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in the one minute we call for the rights of women .
in the next , we have rights for trans@@ gen@@ ders .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound from a American flag , other channels against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
my girl@@ friend looks at me and says : &quot; these things aren &apos;t related to you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? , &quot; I wonder .
I have already taken this conversation .
people who have been working or people who have been working for me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built themselves in their imagination .
they susp@@ end me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practic@@ ed our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , on different species but somehow we are all put in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is designed very well in our collective performance that as Muslims , as I do not fit there , become invali@@ d there .
de@@ mus@@ li@@ zation become mixed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even a poet that poetry is best selling in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures are coming in a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din was so old as I was now , he was a Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but religion was extingu@@ ished in the Western world as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a huge part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another has been in the reduced figures of Muslims , which have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting picture language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman who should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian American scientist Edward Said had the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures continue to stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood still ste@@ ad@@ fast .
I have worked in the news industry for ten years and I saw how this powerful , err@@ one@@ ous narr@@ ative will domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds .
this narr@@ ative hit the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries in the last three decades , while the United States won &apos;t even choose its first female presidential can@@ did@@ acy in 2016 .
this narr@@ ative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from making their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and to cover Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women with their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group practic@@ ed his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong nar@@ row@@ ful weak@@ ened Muslim women , which lead movements for change .
it is evident that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American territory from Afri@@ cans , who had been brought down here to slave trade .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this sc@@ at@@ ative has filled our collective bar@@ gaining strength so far and err@@ one@@ ously busy that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children become the destination of anti @-@ milit@@ ari@@ ous attacks and jack@@ als .
because of these stories we tell and because of the species we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
around 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create fol@@ ks , who help us understand the world .
and my industry is en@@ rich@@ ly failed to capture the nar@@ row@@ ful of 1.7 billion dollars .
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ sto@@ cky American .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants from the first generation , coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my parents immig@@ rated to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first spot design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American Stati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan had re@@ thinking the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were mis@@ mis@@ ed Muslims and Americans .
but have I been mis@@ erable Muslim and American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I do not eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or carry out my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs that all Muslims wear - &quot; from respect to P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t wear all hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs with us .
we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or almost always to be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who stri@@ ve to fight widespread lies across Islam .
these lies are produced on the current band of a well decorated Islam@@ opho@@ bia with money la@@ vers , think tanks and experts for counterfeit information , which is our already err@@ one@@ ous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the species we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a fore@@ igner , who tear down the head@@ scar@@ f .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole United States , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms ass@@ esses our belonging .
it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it can fit into a drawer .

I want to explain this .
I was born as the Muslim , but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old , in a pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior , and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavi@@ ors are not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neighbor , my neighbor in the surf see that I am Muslim , when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that could separate our houses .
she would see the omni@@ present rit@@ ual with my daughter when I kept them in my arms and her the Arabic lines to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ impulse .
each of them I repeat three times .
for this reason , I beg you , that it is protected from evil , to evil that one can see and evil that you can &apos;t see .
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim &apos;s belonging is always part of my shadow .

appro@@ ves use .
belonging is the picture of my grandmother &apos;s maternal grandmother with her sisters ; how many decades ago they win a competition of the art of floral artists in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings by the ancient Su@@ fi @-@ Holy ; and an Kor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which they can be almost in@@ able .
Muslim means to be the prayer which she had said to me , when I have a bad day .
to be the Muslim , as she taught me to refer to God : Allah is what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who has been colon@@ ised by a &quot; Empire &quot; by a &quot; Empire , &quot; which has founded a company with the name of ven@@ erable British East @-@ India company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
appro@@ ves use .
belonging means to grow and listen , that men don &apos;t cry , but at the same time that my grandfather is crying .
meanwhile , while he writes books on the modern Islam and beyond the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an has failed to conf@@ use his family in India , family , that he did not close into his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians who , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by colon@@ ists , who have shared the Muslim world as at stake .
for the past two centuries , Muslim means that all to four Muslim countries have been colon@@ ised &quot; by four Muslim nations .
it means that the first flight gen@@ om@@ be of history was thrown off in a century over a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir of British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he was the first mosque in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world when I was ever and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

in addition to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion , we are deeply moved into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ inter@@ connected history .
it means that two years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were distributed over every continent , apart from Antarc@@ tica , has gone into Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
an American Muslim is to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy is home to the USA , susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white ass@@ ass@@ in .
it means to know that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a freed black slaves .
it means that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , a Muslim , a Muslim , a Muslim and a journalist , pre@@ viewed the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ ities , but to fail to communicate them on others .

to be a mother , to take care of my child , and to make all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people to establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia consists in the Muslim manifest@@ ations that began with President Bush and have been expanded to President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration li@@ aison officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders from people from just countries , which bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims .
these are the wars we lead and the bombs that we t@@ oss on Muslim lands .
because of the stories we tell and because of those who do not tell us , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University participants showed a scientific picture and desired them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding the evolution of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest point .
the conversation we need to lead
we are too deeply dar@@ ing to reveal Muslim , Muslim , or the other &quot; others . &quot;
we stand back decades , the roots of our fears , and the err@@ one@@ ous and dangerous @-@ visual expression we present in our news coverage .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple with d@@ ash @-@ looking ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , Say of Bu@@ zz@@ ard ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ a ; the vir@@ g@@ ist Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , increased Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope .

and that moment has consequences , which go out over 1.7 billion euros .
there is a reason that con@@ spir@@ ation@@ ist the@@ or@@ ist existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown , because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by having created the &quot; other &quot; .
a few years before , it had not been given them ; now , there are large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the real@@ ities and history , which I was not aware of me when I was so old now , as I was now my daughter , but who made me today an inv@@ alu@@ able Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
things that are perhaps aw@@ aken , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions that our humanity might make , a story is l@@ ur@@ king , where somebody is made to a &quot; others . &quot;

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why don &apos;t I tell it here at this T@@ ED@@ x talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people through the monkeys of &quot; other &quot; in public presentation , four decades ago had been Scientific of Stan@@ ford .
we must ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of him , consci@@ ously , and un@@ conscious of the &quot; other &quot; on the role , as it was able to introduce ourselves to a new future in which we have no pre@@ sidents , while he has already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; to other ge@@ ared &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for stor@@ yt@@ eller aims to preserve urban lingu@@ istic diversity

can there be an opportunity to enter here in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the count of stories in their original language is a possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported about an alternative text by Steven Bird , the in@@ translated blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS does not lie on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the lingu@@ istic diversity of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Oak@@ land , in the United States , where T@@ LS has existed since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite small languages can not be handed over to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
mass mortality of the world may be avoided , when we create cities that require diversity - safe rooms in which residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are in order to be considered .
while listening is often associated with it , to understand &quot; be@@ ating these events instead &quot; the listening to appreciate , &quot; follow &quot; instead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers provide their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are no professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their de@@ vot@@ ion and their presentation make sure that the audiences are included .
they cry out laugh@@ ing and emotions , then the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou also takes the opportunity to explain the narr@@ ative of the narr@@ ative of the narr@@ ative .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ uss from the rab@@ bit and the Pa@@ vian language in Zimbabwe :
after expl@@ aining the importance of his f@@ rank , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he divi@@ des his feel of exclu@@ si@@ vity :
they have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
to date , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . everyone who inspired by the project can be found in contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the USA re@@ vocation of the sovereign debt
with the aim of a re@@ trial of the Public Deb@@ t of Puerto Rico , which amount to 72 million US dollars on April 3 , 2017 , several religious and bourgeois organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ ber@@ ian Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ dan@@ o p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural examination ) and the National Assembly of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ate of the re@@ fest@@ ation of the debt have also submitted a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto R@@ os demanded that politicians , banks and government agencies , responsible for the debts , are responsible for their corruption .
we demand a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debts , with a firm , to our working conditions , the compensation in favour of the economy .
we are pres@@ sur@@ ized and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto R@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
the pension@@ ers will not be able to find out with decreasing pension payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not within the territory of the United States - is suffering from the United States - suffers from a heavy financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economic , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of state infrastructure .
from outside imposed measures , without the participation and conviction of citizens , are risk to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration was the name of &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

artists and writers , the work of the missing Syrian Develop@@ er Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , supporters and members put the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which will be al@@ igned in Berlin , dedicated himself to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara Ru@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ ner ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book published in the last year and is not available here , contains a number of articles that are dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is an homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book wants to discuss how movements are assembled for free knowledge and what the true costs are linked to which this is linked .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movements of free knowledge , have been working on page to view over the fog , which gives our news@@ feeds and create something of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free bas@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the A@@ dra prison directory , in which he was sitting on October 3 , 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in free culture , many of us will begin to think about their own fate , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time extreme beliefs ?
the web developer of Open Source and digital activity has been held in the Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military service to an unknown place .
his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; military police bases had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tribunal of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was cont@@ acted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , that they themselves acted as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
his place and condition continues to remain unknown .
a pioneer in Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand access to internet and knowledge of the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologi@@ an and at the moment the ladder of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of b@@ ass@@ els &apos;s cultural prototypes are more pro@@ voc@@ able than the work that he started re@@ construc@@ tive with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists to virtually design the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the difference of numerous ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architectural models with hi@@ ther@@ to traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put all that architecture which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world .
this shift in digital archae@@ ology and preser@@ vation has created a time capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not close this project until now .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in jail :
I spent my entire life in order to dream of freedom , and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her .

which I carry with passion for me ,
if your eyes may say goodbye

Bass@@ el &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against the regime &apos;s Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5.000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime , tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in detention .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : owing to corruption and sentenced to pre @-@ release taxes on pre@@ ten@@ ding post
the Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption that returned to the workplace after the half of his sentence to the workplace in the state machine , where corruption was committed .
this is the result of Di@@ od@@ ine Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison on four other def@@ endants with four other def@@ endants in 2010 .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose Council was Chief Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his re @-@ setting to the company , what happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , that prohib@@ its the application , there would be no obst@@ acle to Cam@@ b@@ aza , again to refer to its old position as the company had not completed its confin@@ ement .
however , many residents don &apos;t mean the action well .
the Centre of Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integr@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company to make the director again :
a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP .
what we have to acknowledge , that the company should also have a discipl@@ in@@ arian procedure against the contradic@@ tions .
however , the company appears , however , and illustr@@ ate no appropriate legal steps for the application of the relevant functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Mozambique social media , re@@ jects this behaviour as well as &quot; contradic@@ ted &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , it would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of which has been given .
he could keep paid speech@@ es and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped harm .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ence and student of political science in Brazil , says the director of no mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state , because he ins@@ ulting him , I can &apos;t believe anybody would be rewarded with such a massive rise .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ ality and to serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has instead served himself to the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as handy to have an in@@ exhau@@ stible financial source and the state itself became tired of that man , who was invited and finally sentenced to a long sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remember the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief is in jail .
Thi@@ eves are part of the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison will not only be remembered as the first independent President in memory but also as a sharp , single @-@ cutting and - by way - prophe@@ tically Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , it was an ener@@ ge@@ tically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of selling its own individual interest in its amb@@ itions . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious person is changing , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not withdraw from its amb@@ itions .
an ambitious human being is a criminal . &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also rejected :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he was 10 years old and he was free .
and today , the company , in which he inherited the validity of money , is again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - the α@@ B _ Raf@@ ik on May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to wrong
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ peas or sp@@ ell .

according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network made their minds from the net because they ab@@ stain@@ ed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of Eastern indigenous origin , or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook equi@@ p@@ ates the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or by taking them ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the ascension has given radical nation@@ alistic movements to the word an extremely se@@ ven@@ ous con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists than hate crimes against Muslims , which constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word in itself does not appear automatically based on them .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that too , in which they have discussed the use of the word , or have expressed doubt two of its use to be cen@@ sored .
furthermore there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same book sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair at Bur@@ m@@ ese also wrote &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( bubble ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ out A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was extingu@@ ished today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on spiritu@@ ally asked whether they could relie@@ ve his back pain by using a p@@ un .
the ku of ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ung is the opinion that they should reduce hate language radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ized that Facebook analysts ought to be analy@@ tic before it extingu@@ ishes all the tru@@ sts that is suspected to spread rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you write to Fac@@ eli@@ ac .
what to do instead , is carefully analy@@ sing the post and control it by checking the next words .
for instance , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( bubble bath ) .
the good is that these three nation@@ alistic nation@@ alists , the hate language spreading , get a rather good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action is a strong signal to all send them , hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy does not long to stop .
the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ orship of perc@@ ep@@ ts often have a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , whereby the user social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative write @-@ wise of the cen@@ sored word to express its views .
the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ ung my@@ at described how Facebook started to delete its posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was attentive to this new gui@@ deline of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically my post was removed from Facebook and I was told the li@@ ken , post and sharing of contents for 24 hours , because the Post will not de@@ file the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts away from people who have no negative int@@ entions , or the simply try to demonstrate their opinions against them to radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his postal mail has been removed , which has nothing to do with hate language :
post @-@ free speech from Facebook is removed .
in Post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism are badly in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine thinks that Facebook would have to do more than the beginning of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community asks for Council :
Facebook might have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention of reducing rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
to grant such words , only more hatred will bring in the various communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have all started without local context or technical support and so words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; In@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; are forbidden .
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they were not trying to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied Po@@ sts .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a large turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks is automatic c@@ ens@@ orship for a lot of spending by users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make funny and write about the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their hosts will be taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts which contained no hate language , but nevertheless they were removed :
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and see an inheritance cur@@ ry and see a Indian film .
just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
the post @-@ states &quot; If you &apos;re a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists , social networks have also used to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate language should also heating the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to bring out the wu@@ app@@ y hate to his bur@@ ial sites , critic@@ ised .
but instead of att@@ ing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it might have been better running in context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago has concluded with the child before
a wedding ring in sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanimously decided to negoti@@ ate a law which should offer this practice , so that the full age is now at 18 .
in front of this change , some members of du@@ alistic and Muslim religious groups took part in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ persi@@ ad Mahar@@ aj joined the country &apos;s religious groups ( IR@@ O ) , a group who would not inter@@ fere with representatives of the various religious groups in the country , as the state was not the maturity of maturity . &quot;
this was irrelevant to the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago has defined a contract partner of the UN child prevention , the min@@ ors of people under 18 years of age . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15 , Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical centre of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married among 19 boys .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , which were anxi@@ ous to abol@@ ish laws on child@@ before , followed by the foot and rejo@@ iced their support . undoubtedly , they helped bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children before , they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition provided stress in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometime later , doubts were on whether the Opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s case - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , that he ab@@ stain@@ ed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must be united and pro@@ claim the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators wanted a status update on Facebook which has reg@@ ained Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle at Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill of the children before the House of Represent@@ atives was sentenced to 35 votes in the House of Represent@@ atives , and there was no one against it .
after first decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed , because the laws finally had changed to children before .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a prime minister in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took all too much time and unnecessary su@@ ede , which has lost the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth every price .
while Abel Jackson , the opinion was that it would definitely take long enough to do the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook of L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the sp@@ ouse has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
following the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society that talked about how important was the adoption of the law , noted :
the mar@@ r@@ able age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the age of 18 .
the design for the E@@ ver of Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es was decided on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives , 35 of them were present at the vote .
all the dep@@ uties , who were against , voted for the law .
the child before is legally allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ is@@ child@@ less .
thanks to all the activists who have fo@@ iled him out .
congratulations . congratulations .
thanks to our ME@@ Ps .
but there is a possible hook in the form of Satellite Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation in the country .
prior to months , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take court steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law said it was quite legitim@@ ately , if Mahar@@ aj was thinking against the law , most social media users wanted to make the debate different .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested that :
dear Mary , if we say , instead of discussing the discussion as general , in a way that we invite only panic and wor@@ m@@ wood if we would like to talk about the problem that it may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ minded men who are contrary to them , &quot; would you be ready to proceed discussion ?
or do you think it is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial ver@@ ge against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children before in different gra@@ d@@ ations are legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that they should under@@ go .

through the spe@@ ar of web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content
the Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , compared to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month , Turkey closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day , more important , how important is the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and fans of TV series fight against the blocking .
although many technology experienced Internet users are used to use envel@@ opes tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users don &apos;t fall into this category .
although Turkey closed articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been taking place since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( no . 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second best known country in the world when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ orship from Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to remain locked , several mirrors ( pages containing the content of Wikipedia are mir@@ ro@@ red and frequently updated ) .
a solution was published by IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
the content is dis@@ able , though , in spite of the laws .
in a blo@@ c post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we heard the news ( on the pl@@ ying of Wikipedia ) , we operating everything to disman@@ tle Snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents to de@@ centr@@ alised and distributed fashion .
this can help users to look at least all Wikipedia content even if it does not reach the site www.@@ wi@@ ktion@@ ary@@ .org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was run independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is just about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to deal the lock .
Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i of Wik@@ im@@ edia , Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ est@@ pe@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to show similar Mir@@ ror sites when there is Wikipedia closed in the country on Wikipedia .
Cons@@ onn@@ i reported sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and staff at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it &apos;s not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a Mir@@ ror .
one att@@ aches to another URL , which is not the original . that which one looks then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server runs on request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese game photographer uses his camera to attract attention to the need for nature protection

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission used .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around herself , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with bad , blocked moti@@ ves and well @-@ washed colors .
this motivated him a camera to wear and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ al@@ ese , ende@@ avo@@ red to the international scene .
and his home resort right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that len@@ ders attention to Nepal as wildlife .
he described this top position on Facebook as he helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it better give for a passionate game photographer ! !
I just rested from home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan Ga@@ ida Lodge ) called me . he had received a phone call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river is just a few minutes from the tourist place Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately began to kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar wants a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal as nature and want to deep@@ en the understanding of the fact that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look like .
and he should know it , because he has already standing tig@@ ers from face to face :
tiger may not distur@@ b by the opinion of the sheep at sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
also , because of darkness in the way home , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ avi@@ est appeared . he immediately sett@@ les down , we look forward to seeing me through the sin@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and stayed in a tent in order to capture in the Bar@@ dia National Park shots of Ot@@ ter . up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger and take six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds which live near the tourist information .

years after the wedding , Indian women became the first time to pron@@ ounce the names of their husbands

this entry was posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many sharing of India , women shall avoid worse care , husbands , husbands , or even older men in the family .
instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should desp@@ ise the norm in life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by an illu@@ sion@@ ist court and exp@@ elled from her family and the village community after having called a given relatives with his name .
the tradition of wives also does not name in the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less chance to fear if ever , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel , as well as house@@ wives , became a unique club with the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , which they discuss and discuss the fin@@ eness of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and set up for the dismant@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Ro@@ hin@@ i Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era at the discovery of intern@@ ships , such as kinder@@ garten up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and runs these clubs .
it reports on how these clubs were created a safe place for these women , and they were made simultaneously dealing with amb@@ ass@@ adors of the Change .
the first video that showed Ro@@ hin@@ i in their discussion round , acted by women who call their husbands at the name .
she decided on this subject , because she would open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to address the names of their husbands , an increase is not guilty and never questioned .
Ro@@ hin@@ i thinks :
this tradition test@@ ifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes for a long life .
a woman who does not hold this , is regarded as a dec@@ eit@@ ful tongue , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never done thoughts about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Ro@@ hin@@ i wanted to have never mentioned her husband until now , at home , at home , as it works .
she showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother @-@ in law .
Ro@@ hin@@ i tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video had ended .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him by now on his name .
Ro@@ hin@@ i started her first conversation with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members were a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round Ro@@ hin@@ i showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
following the video projection , the women tried to put the discussion with an exercise in motion .
Ro@@ hin@@ i beg@@ ged all participants to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , sc@@ and@@ alized , sad , lov@@ ingly and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our husbands , but they can call us how they want , that they should not respect us ?
should it be equivalent to it ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought their husbands about their lips , &quot; says Ro@@ hin@@ i Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a century @-@ old tradition in which women never married the names of their husbands .
Ro@@ hin@@ i tells :
a woman was so shy that , during the whole exercise , she just laugh@@ ed away , and another decided to leave the fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the ad@@ ren@@ aline rush to have broken with an ancient bridge , the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at their name .
they kept their word .
over the next days , Ro@@ hin@@ i received a multitude of reports .
the husband of a wife called Ro@@ hin@@ i and asked what ideas they put on women in his head , his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law dra@@ gged her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Ro@@ hin@@ i said that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of participating in the situation was less understand@@ able and the situation had art@@ ed in violence .
Ro@@ hin@@ i reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of interest no@@ red point on the forehead , which shows the marriage status :
why do women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ red point if he would do it .
he laugh@@ ed only , and I listened to it , to carry him .
the other women are not completely stopped , but mean they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it in some days .
for many women , discussion is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we do a trip with every Dis@@ cussion Club .
normally we pack all lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says .
during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days in their life with cakes ; they danced and sang , talking about things about which they had never thought before .
Ro@@ hin@@ i says :
I have been working with these problems since so many years and yet I also have made many things , for example , how our ident@@ ities are linked to our husbands , never so honest .
it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we have enter@@ tain ourselves about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is in their marriage .
for most of them is okay , but some wanted to have a sal@@ ine cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a tro@@ users , they have not looked at themselves .
after much dispute and discussion on the advantages of its own dress code , the mor@@ als connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , Ro@@ hin@@ ted Ro@@ hin@@ i their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that the women could carry it .
next , they decided to plan an excursion to Go@@ a , where they can wear Je@@ ans and Ro@@ hin@@ i is sure to get it .
to question whether in the five months of their first conversation , Ro@@ hin@@ i confirms that things are slowly entering the re@@ els :
we have made only little steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , do not make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
just one or two still say the names of their husbands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the Dis@@ cussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the F@@ eil@@ ing to achieve more freedom of movement or its own coat @-@ election - at the end of a difficult to navigate .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Ro@@ hin@@ i declares :
each of us is a victim of Patri@@ arch@@ ate &apos;s patri@@ archy .
I also am there .
but this club gives everyone a confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , when any woman comes home and other people who talk about what we &apos;re talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit down in the same boat .

the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that g@@ low @-@ headed men could be in Mozambique target of attacks .

a new system of se@@ duction of gl@@ aci@@ al persons for organ retail , probably for super@@ st@@ itious uses , is argu@@ ed by the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers away from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated , and some of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and subsequently proved that the bodies of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
it give the local super@@ st@@ itions that the head of a gl@@ aci@@ fier man could reveal gold , declared the police pre@@ acher of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia to the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks have been registered on g@@ low @-@ headed men in Mozambique .
another group , aiming for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN in 2016 to carry out a mission in the South African country to examine these practition@@ ers .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries in southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who prefer to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men that are traveling to Mozambique are target rit@@ ual men in Mozambique are the target rit@@ ual attacks , warned the Mozambique police according to the latest murdered men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the murdered were held .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ urban in the south of Mozambique , said that local police have already followed the case :
PR@@ M believed that the lab@@ ans are involved in the death of men &apos;s g@@ assing men .
the persecution and murder of gl@@ aci@@ al individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sh@@ aman , which also suggests that a faith exists , according to which the victims would have power in his head , the wealth of riches .
in recent days , three men were killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ reira Sam@@ an@@ tha announced the Chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ g@@ gers arms S@@ na@@ i@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty of which Mozambique is confron@@ ted :
I want to go to GER@@ MAN E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , THE S@@ I sh@@ amed One Country , in which the teachers would be ashamed of having sex vs. good notes , and other services to earn their bread , a country in which people are not ch@@ asing the al@@ bin@@ os or &quot; black magic &quot; that aim to aim to become a quick riches .
despite the senti@@ ment of the phenomenon , some had the opportunity to miss our wireless humor .
Zen@@ ob@@ ald Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter Nut@@ s , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ app@@ ies , as well as the police pre@@ acher Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both passionate :

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , which probably was recently made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o held attention in international community attention , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June , that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed for cancer of cancer in the hospital .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State endang@@ ering ) after he took part in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which calls for the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has been referred to as &quot; an internal issue &quot; and a spokes@@ man tells about it as &quot; not needed to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
nonetheless , China continues to release views from the international community , the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , release or allow him to allow treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others have completely out of the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press summar@@ ized some of the reactions abroad .
United Nations
po@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June , to discuss the case of Liu .
a spokes@@ man , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to enable Liu in abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s minist@@ erial president Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ending have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us .
the relationship between China and Norway came into the Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu , although the Norwegian government announced that this would eventually have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations was resum@@ ed until December last year . however , in June , Norway led an agreement to res@@ ume the Lach@@ aise back in China , as the exports since 2010 were mostly blocked .
after the news spread , Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release and invited Liu an to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his incar@@ cer@@ ation , he was unable to increase his price .
during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to liber@@ ate Liu and his wife immediately to liber@@ ate the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants .
the top diplomatic mission of the European Union , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , asked China also for the release of Li@@ us , as she announced in an explanation on 30 June :
at the same time , we are expecting to raise all restrictions on Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they should meet all the visits and receive , which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
U.S. ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans told him that he has the opportunity to treat the treatment abroad , as far as it is concerned with his satisfaction . &quot;
a spokesperson for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency on June 27 that the embassy was forced to release the Chinese authorities , not only Liu , but also his wife Liu X@@ ia release from her house arrest .
the US embassy moved an angry response from China to himself , with the outside of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country have the right to redeem himself and answered in@@ correct remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the married couple :
protection and freedom , such as travel and access to medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled to Chinese constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push ahead Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I demand China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , un@@ condition@@ ally , so that it can be ordered in a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
the German government of Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , that Liu explains the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news agency Reuters , that China had major concern , whether the vort@@ ex could o@@ vers@@ ha@@ ze Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China urged China to provide a reasonable medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AFP before that Li@@ us Woman , Liu X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room at the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone beyond , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells further :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old his international human rights reform , including freedom of expression , to uph@@ old the rights of such rights .
France
France &apos;s State Department requested China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments he needs , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family can have contact with it .
although the news service France info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France would end it eventually .
Taiwan
the Council of the Legisl@@ ative Assembly in Taiwan took on 27 June to release Liu &apos;s release and demand a greater tolerance towards those who require peaceful means to challenge political reform and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u from the ruling Democratic Movement Party called on China to allow the ill of intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in an explanation on 28 June by Liu very concerned and gave him that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being well @-@ being .
he said about Liu :
it is my faith that the initiatives he took and was punished for which he was punished , more stable , more prosp@@ erous and prosp@@ erous China , which in turn has contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally and encouraged me when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stup@@ id@@ ly , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the ministers noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore , because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people go wrong .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to rotate &quot; the logic , &quot; to defend the existing authorized exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country , you hear that we finally don &apos;t have any country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the certificate of a escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory infr@@ in@@ gement .
Singapore , if you are not my country , then shall it be ?
the reasons caused by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to what was able to measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of what , he seemed un@@ so@@ lic@@ ally un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco , or New York , alike cities which are managed by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the main point of the subject , the good old bodies of the author@@ itarian leaders goes on to give the proposed democr@@ ats , leaving logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the final week the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were given answers to his American guests concerning our press , our Ju@@ di@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answer .
on these questions , he tried with non @-@ answer r@@ ational species .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to illustr@@ ate his opinion , as they did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city is , what country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on to clari@@ fy this point where he was paid up to be part of the town of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog , he has published his comment on the reviews that you should start to read the whole tran@@ script of the conference to be able to understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , according to those Singapore should be a city and no country .
please read the tran@@ script .
as he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; be regarded as a country , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore should be so un@@ easy , even if we are looking forward to and just as a fair elections .
he contra@@ ctu@@ ally Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
as he said that Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously not meant it in this sense !
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows its dis@@ appointment of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , which makes as leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore did so much ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected - am I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not sure of whether he really believes , properly and aware of what he is defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review de@@ marks the vulner@@ ability of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am have committed a mistake , or was it a fre@@ er @-@ author ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country the sovereign rights of the city are going back to Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role in the inter@@ governmental system , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , they only defend their city ?
who must pay our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink personal identity ?
are we the citizens of a country or the residents of a city ?
well , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade into the expl@@ aining , Singapore is and was always a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have sc@@ and@@ alized many of the people of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island nation .
I can understand that we are often cited as &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but that is not quite right .
we should rather talk about the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked for short his editors : what is the most mis@@ used aspect about your residence or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world revealed and another fac@@ et shall be shown .
the latest part of this series dates from Nev@@ is Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is put to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on what situation the conversation occurs , it is considered cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his talk partner by presenting personal questions .
in my clari@@ fication , the default answer is then follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook car@@ n@@ ly before anger when they are kept for Americans but doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who does not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visi@@ bly on their back@@ pack if they are travelling .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
by contrast Americans ... .
that &apos;s how I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - prior to Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le sheets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
there aren &apos;t any weapons with us !
gay marriage have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everybody seems to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously speak very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is reportedly regarded as the toler@@ ant country toward ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends who I admire very much .
there would be nothing to me , when one would switch to Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
firstly : as &quot; nice &quot; to be called &quot; nice &quot; to be s@@ ke@@ ely , as the good @-@ minded , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a double Canadian woman ) .
if Canada really would have a nation full of people such as N@@ ed Flanders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
be harmless , means in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and in@@ interesting to earn no attention .
that can be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , fer@@ na@@ b of the things that happen around one around .
I would even go to say that the desire , free and alone , is a major leader of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own matters .
what out@@ si@@ ders described as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans do not talk about the fence with our neighbours .
we are missing the warm heart@@ ed , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends .
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ de@@ au led the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice , &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada right too sexy .

one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band published a music video that took power by the Jun@@ ta and re @-@ establish the power in 2014 and re@@ igns in spite of their promises to restore civilian rule .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) , the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told it his girl@@ friend makes his girl@@ friend .
although not expressly politically , the music video still refers to the continuing military domin@@ ance of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet use for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for song was a huge success .
in the first three days , this video was shared on Facebook 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Lik@@ es .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists over@@ looked the public to view this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policy , especially as it stands in the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta dom@@ ination .
take a look at the videos of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand were followed in the past three years .

the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for &quot; installation change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered a critic of the jun@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the implementation of the law relating to computer criminal , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often exploited by the authorities to toler@@ ate activists and other critics of the State .
for this purpose , a new unit was instit@@ uted in the army , the online content monitored and persons accused of having sl@@ ander@@ ed the monarchy , is prosec@@ uted .
Thailand sets a strict ban on &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( mar@@ qu@@ ee ins@@ ult ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta still pursu@@ es its decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase would be unnecessary and a waste of tax gel@@ ding .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black supply chain before being put them into an intern@@ ship , another problem .
some journalists sit in prison , because they allegedly created &quot; confusion &quot; in society and under@@ min@@ ed web sentences , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .

the post@@ war company covers only very slowly in East @-@ Asia , especially in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking p@@ ics .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ Chil@@ ava are situated in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , kidn@@ apping and Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today the largest part Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
these settlements are also called v@@ ast@@ asia in par@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , there are only a few hundred people living in these vul@@ tures .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16.000 people had risen once more than a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

the empty five storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ko@@ w@@ kas , symbo@@ lic@@ ally symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
buildings are fallen and rarely are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ?
it &apos;s still unique . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens , which were all served by the community .
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
the people who once lived at this place once lived and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ u@@ ch@@ ow@@ l , which can accommodate one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me in the hand of the camera , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; our Mother is forbidden to let us take a photo , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; it is just forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers her girl@@ friend something and suddenly they left the destroyed building and disappear .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( extension of agricultural products for the self @-@ demand ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to come across the rounds .
during winter , the district administration supplies free candles and bread on the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will arrange zu@@ cchini &quot;
some ten years ago , an old woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina hasn &apos;t left Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot; she tells her .
Gal@@ ina wants no financial assistance from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ son instead .
gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden still a house , it &apos;s very difficult to survive , &quot; she is too .
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells her that she and other vill@@ agers seek to meet regularly and to celebrate holidays together .

a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
but we can &apos;t do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls to her &quot; Nat@@ alya her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as talk party in Nat@@ ascha , together with her husband and the five joint children living in her house for some time lived .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , she rec@@ alls itself to the village in front of the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central India , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia broke out ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administration of administration in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but that will take something else , &quot; she explains them .
Nat@@ ascha is awarded $ 9 for each child .
her husband is working in the coal pit .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they hold pigs , cows , t@@ aps and chickens .
it tells us that the situation was initially a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; we don &apos;t be afraid of the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
actually , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everybody lived like it was right .
every day , I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation is ended , a little boy is running to us .
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball takes from the window and another boy ch@@ ases him back .
he plays with the ball , who then rolls the hill .
a group of children is watching the ball now .
while they walk , some of them throw stones to the fallen buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which care for dis@@ grace in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and is published here with friendly permission .
on the path of migrants , cross Europe or Latin America , certain places will be known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican player , a small woman with a coral pink jacket and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bear design .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . however , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans , who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , br@@ ushing walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an migrants here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you from Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment , it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she also helps them , and brings them to hospital when they are sick , she purchases them drugs that they can &apos;t pay them , they massage them with a bal@@ m away from the long journey of tired feet .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived before a short time .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable first name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yoghurt tu@@ bs ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil , hoping to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao is traveling with his sister , hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and her three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on the way to the United States , normally a first stop in South America and then go towards the north .
the family had heard from other cats from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel together the route and that the Afri@@ cans were talking on What@@ s@@ App from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance , and worked as a construction worker at the construction of the Olympic Games and the soccer World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; m@@ um Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he answers a smile . &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests send their often text messages when they are gone to report them or to report about the course of their trip .
it explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught them to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark for the migrants who are traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , S@@ ack@@ g@@ asse leads to Jes@@ har@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their little house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus ticket to be sold to numerous African immigrants .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly shar@@ ks .
some sleeping on the floor , but at least they have electricity , washing machine and a cooking area outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after three years he lived , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his labor station .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to extract money from him without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , an all @-@ stone , has offered him its roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the gears , passengers consult their phones quietly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large majority of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full but she is also nostal@@ gic for those who have gone away .
as a proud grand@@ ma she bl@@ ur@@ izes in her album with many photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care that you made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , young and old .
she laugh@@ ed sor@@ row@@ fully , while she briefly introduces me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; you &apos;ve been gone . &quot;
China : X@@ in@@ jiang people are forced to install a surveillance app for their cell phones .
open @-@ point check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ in@@ jiang , an ethnic min@@ orities region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell phones .
on July 10 , the cell phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of the town of Ur@@ um@@ qi sent a cell phone in which they initi@@ ate the District government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
in the message , it is said that the app &quot; is to restri@@ ct access to terrorist information . &quot;
however , the authorities can also use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to a exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app shortly after they had replaced the app .
in the release of the police report that the app will determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection rating with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , of online fraud , Trojan and ph@@ ishing sites to make users attentive , how much time they spend time online and control your own home network .
these app using the filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these functions can , of course , be used in various ways .
for example , the &quot; remote @-@ state players or even h@@ acker could enable the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or steal .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , forced ethnic minority regions such as X@@ in@@ jiang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often as@@ sign extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet connection circuits .
based on Twitter based media out@@ let Images from Main@@ land China , &quot; photos from a check@@ point , published images from a Check@@ point where police officers in@@ discrimin@@ ate the residents , whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ in@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that the people will install the app within 10 days .
if you are found on a Check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use appliances which are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by rep@@ ay@@ ing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( with the rule of the rule , too . in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift up a Windows operating system , and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard disk .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computer and cell phones in X@@ in@@ jiang by electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly have a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minim@@ ize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and associations , including universities and research institutions , are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , a US Human Rights Organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ in@@ jiang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media storage cards &quot; at the local police register .
the intention is obviously to identify and anni@@ hil@@ ate any &quot; terrorist videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of other possible outcomes , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es to death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; where the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane tells his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look on and stell@@ st that you are alone at one place where all the most important has disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved itself and revealed a truth which is clearly recognis@@ able , both from inside and outside .
one that makes all the glory to their names .
one that has broken down in a list of feelings and expressions , who do not allow any met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality turns you back and behind the scenes , beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes , and the performer - turn the characters in essence of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubt release themselves in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if Earth are caught up on the axis of the incur@@ able thing . you will become clear that you are caught between the walls , which your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone may build stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for I &quot; mean &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the Security Council form@@ ulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power to prove us by being even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts , which we knew .
five young people were torn during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to make the city the darkness out of the night with &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the quarters were cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a town , which until the arter@@ ies with state safety @-@ organisms and their ac@@ complic@@ es is cr@@ ammed .
in the third night , things had a little bit cal@@ ming after the power supply of the quarter ceased to work .
I broke the silence by crying out several times , &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice sp@@ ies through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to collect .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends join me ; we united in a magnificent picture that met my expectations and fulfilled all .
in such a moment , you are aware that you are still free the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the lift .
I received a call from my father : &quot; get ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can return to your voice after you s@@ nat@@ ched all the way up to the office of the Security Service .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot;
his eyes filled up upon me .
&quot; and you dream of what to look at me in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I was standing before this building .
maybe it was in my fool@@ is@@ hness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure when I answered , &quot; I had not thought that you have forgotten my voice before yesterday .
and I think I never stopped looking forward to seeing you in your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fat@@ ale consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said .
&quot; he puts him in sol@@ itary and his father the same with it . &quot;
&quot; his father equals to it . &quot;
the smell of this cursed pro@@ positions lies me up until today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture , which I was suspended for months .
I pier@@ c@@ ite the farm .
in the first office I will leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells .
I wish all the details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise they have given me a bigger cell for me this time .
I have to share it with just one other prisoner , and may immediately sit down , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I turned back on an old and tried communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell @-@ tain@@ er was a &quot; Gener@@ ally apprenti@@ ce . &quot;
after long hes@@ itation , he rep@@ lied to me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a highly regarded man @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there are no striking faces of facial features , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all the numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to me ? &quot;
all answers deny His existence .
perhaps it was re@@ located in one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had as@@ sures me , they would be happy when I stay .
liar . liar .
I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to distribute all these cro@@ ws , who laugh@@ ed on the fruits in the garden of my head .
far from the distance I can still hear Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; within the distance .
it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always taking this time the scre@@ am , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the color of corruption is , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; thunder@@ ings , &quot; playing on the 13th sc@@ ure of Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
with this , the secret was canc@@ eled : to protect and prevent the state safety against us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wit@@ e dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational re@@ pres@@ sive map and made the close eye view of their world view .
this is not a house , here is no country ; it is a curse which they call Ko@@ exist@@ enz to transform the crimin@@ als of her cl@@ ans into a hero .
I cared for the hearing and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me as before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You &apos;re still young , you can
I would not reply .
I &apos;m getting used to it , not to answer .
I can really no longer tell , when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation become an ordinary communication tool .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to be acc@@ ust@@ omed to me or bad to be punished , although I had nothing to earn this punishment .
at punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ k appe@@ als to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot hold your cry .
my cry did not help him , so why they ex@@ pose the pipe by a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector , or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had four cables in each other , to present ourselves from their view@@ point , great invention of a huge cable .
in a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in the series .
I had lost all the feeling in my body - and also my voice , which I heard to cry out .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling and found no pleasure in it , so why he &apos;s next to an electrically charged rod grip .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again . let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed away , that came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am answering with the voice of a &quot; exhausted &quot; youth : &quot; my lord , my father must worry about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and gone , you are laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib deep@@ ens the majority of his time . sometimes he sho@@ ots on his canvas , narrow down to his computer , and again to his couch .
as soon as you can rely , a cigarette between his fingers , or with nic@@ ot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips is to be discovered .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year where Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced to escape from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ lows ( about : farmer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ ib is a passionate activist who has surrendered to the conservative majority and their ob@@ struc@@ ting opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression through art and rap@@ ine .
with his music , which often deal with topics like Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian Ge@@ ograph@@ ers , he also calls for the core of all the Arab world . all these themes can not only be found in its hom@@ etown of Amman , but also in cities who range from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ ib sees itself as a person who is not restricted by limits in his mind , and he can also feel the most devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if it is not open , it swe@@ eps up against the US foreign policy , a special dis@@ agreement .
H@@ da@@ ib illustrates his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ ib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to do in mar@@ tial arts , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian Ge@@ ograph@@ ers of the second generation , &quot; he himself describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life circumstances , &quot; emphas@@ izes H@@ da@@ ib .
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; while he pour in water dissolved Nes@@ an in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law states that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weakness for doing it with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ting hot jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do against Islam .
basically , the pieces are lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the scar@@ ce of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose becomes first primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the sky , especially if one throws a look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore it avo@@ ids to do basic things - as in public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to do not land in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ anian has canc@@ eled a gig of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila , already for the second time .
some parliamentary committees supporting the Islamic Emirate of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual front@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , has resi@@ sted the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert table .
the Euro MP and former press conference in the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert &quot; was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the vision@@ ist .
many claim also , the dedication of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world is dangerous acti@@ vism , which in@@ quire of the well @-@ proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to apply for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be simply a rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually a clear signal @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs plant .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib made traditional sex nor@@ ms to abol@@ ish his vision from the fate of Arab women , who have vo@@ re@@ juven@@ ate sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly burnt unknown woman whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who they actually need to trust .
over the past years , the number of &apos; Ehren@@ mor@@ de &apos; has risen in Jordan - the un@@ official position left in Jordan .
human Rights Watch : according to Human Rights Watch the number of Hon@@ orary Union reached its zen@@ ith in 2016 ; however , the institutional infrastructure is still missing to support the women who tried to support murder or domestic violence to the appropriate manner .
according to a law on breaking control from 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of in@@ famili@@ al violence , &quot; and for their release , often a year @-@ long bureaucr@@ atic effort and the guarantee by the family is needed that the woman will have nothing to happen .
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music also enjoys great popularity and is known to rever@@ ence even ahead of topics that are long as tab@@ oos in his country .
H@@ da@@ ib den@@ ies that his work is political , however , recognizes that he is his music that is full of explic@@ it attempts of sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion of expression .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
he became a pro@@ ver@@ aged policy , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos; ed , H@@ da@@ ib takes the question about the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs , which are politically politically , can continue .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeatedly mentioned :
&quot; you are free and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the course of the song , H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words &quot; that one wants &quot; - whether faith or not believe , hetero@@ gene@@ ity or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that barely any man speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bian , and that comments on gender equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib led an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , in order to mem@@ ori@@ ze his comments from the context , twi@@ sted and cen@@ sored in his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but was only a revised version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ ib tran@@ qui@@ res the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als did not speak to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ des , a poet of the eighth century , who still has remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ ib asks : if Abu Nu@@ i had to work once on behalf of the cali@@ ph , in the eighth century openly concerning homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do not ?
the real problem , such as H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom it is nothing new that the government has sanc@@ tion@@ ed attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive vote will be put into silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service ordered several former government officials and members of the teaching association , with the grounds that they have expressed himself critical to the problems confron@@ ted by the deep in the country with the deep in the country .
in view of this , the show H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , according to this , is only the peak of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him progress is a constant g@@ low and take up . Jordan has shi@@ fted an appearance for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - such as H@@ da@@ ib - is made of slow , reas@@ oned and inner changes . he is sure that these changes are taking place at the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ ib dreams , like millions of other Arabs , also from a Arab world without interventions abroad .
he is not only dre@@ aming of bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem , and Damascus , but also to experience them . &quot;
perhaps the region is inspired by music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental op@@ enness - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and artificial kind of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until it is done , H@@ da@@ ib is going to pass on , and it will also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
this great , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories as regards the origin of the Neb@@ uta .
it is presum@@ ed that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas too . a further theory states that the drums , the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have come , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ ishi , to force the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how large those parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I &apos;ve been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nonetheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival will take the only True - and spending an amazing way to spend his summer :
&quot; y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high tower was unbelievable .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this story , because they help to stop the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair of Fris@@ eurs .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located at the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road@@ blocks and illegal drug dealers are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region is not safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , visual appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to the fact that more normal citizens can re@@ locate in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers who can recre@@ ate these elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts meeting each other to show who can create from them the ec@@ cent@@ ric fans , as you can see in the following video ( more videos to current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to run their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and , instead of bad advice to obtain training in hair@@ dresser , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and offering possibilities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in March , reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the community and the district , which we are very proud of , because of the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters
photograph : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the book &quot; Liebes@@ message to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel cast out to meet aff@@ ection ?
just this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activist Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconc@@ ile ) that young people encour@@ ages to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently , her country scene was a historical event and they wanted to contribute its part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC gu@@ err@@ illa movement ( German : revolutionary forces ) , which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International for the sig@@ nat@@ ories of the peace agreement as such , the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
before the Colom@@ bian , however , there is still a long way to talk about one real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who have lived for many years in illegal camps , exposed to a rh@@ et@@ oric of war and carried out around the clock in order to integrate their weapons in the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn used to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred for gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now record them into their ranks and support them in the building of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colombia will join together and to help with the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : so far , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who are to be handed over to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which was held in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there were Leonardo and Crist@@ ian the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this stated that we love the people who love we to write on the Valentine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but those who need it much unnecessary .
he plane , he talked about to share his love with people this year , most of the most urgent matters needed .
so the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which now will have to build their place in society and to create a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make the dis@@ course of a war@@ story of a common history of peace . &quot; they say .
so far more than 2,000 letters were collected in the context of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would be forgiven me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ ver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city management of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art traveled into the camp to transfer the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC were up as they had done before to counter@@ act the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of support from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it is amazing how many different feelings are going through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ ine@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the govern@@ ors of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows :
having passed the letters , a former fighter was introduced by the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because next to him there was a M@@ GL pomegran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the thorn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh what are they doing ? &quot; he said , &quot; I reply to a letter I wrote to me . &quot;
it &apos; a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone has written something like a beautiful one , therefore I answer . &quot; then I suddenly set up tears on the che@@ eks .
I h@@ ug@@ ged him , and set me beside the pomegran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for war , it was sorry to be all the years of loyal companions to be this fighting , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life as a war . the F@@ ARC was to lock him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought someone would be forgiven me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have learned how to handle arms .
but now where peace is prev@@ ailing , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
for the first time , students and leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round .
the students were all growing up as already war and the F@@ ARC already existed in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave insights into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social in@@ justice worked on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country more just .
for a goal of this magn@@ itude it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear those people who have never found hearing , and to know that the people , which I often seen as monsters , and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings , who were turned around through their lives and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hurt me .
but it comforts me that all men - even those who have been killed and caused much harm to give us a smile and a hug .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp at Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
column bi@@ ans has been noted that , after de@@ priv@@ ation , peace would rule .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are ready to protest at the weapons , to protest against their rights and to protest against their rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we see from the F@@ ARC now to peace , to a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they listen - about all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our Word , make our contribution , and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . among us who defend life as foundation of existence , many difficulties will be coming .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a trans@@ woman speaks about the persec@@ utions in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article that was written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ o@@ wa and his first publication on the OC Media website .
homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Caucas@@ us region are exposed to a large range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and compres@@ sors .
with terr@@ ors , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months about the gay men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
but the threat , which is like a Dam@@ o cl@@ an worth over the present LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only formed by night .
OC media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and spoke with us about what is happening in the republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines in several months after reports published in the Republic of them@@ at@@ ment , torture and killing of que@@ ens in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta , and she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , who arrested certain que@@ ens and arrested them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a transaction , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
even since their childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was raised , her became aware that Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group had experienced Che@@ chens from the gender equality of their land woman , the hunt for Sabrina was opened .
she was afraid of her life in the United States .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer aid in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a transaction that was stuck in trouble .
she had no money , so I did not hesitate to delay her .
while I was trying to help her , someone who thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere in the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . he lost her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya that could remove these dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents went on through on What@@ s@@ App &apos;s round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was doing just taking a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt me nothing .
then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you still honour the family , you shout ? &quot;
I don &apos;t know the person .
I only know there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and a@@ woke the last final in the hospital .
apparently , some women had to participate and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two problems in my right lung condition .
OC Media : in which hospitals were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time in his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful for him that he is respec@@ tful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
I got threats to last February .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , alien@@ ation , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the demanded of sending me to Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
they asked absurd claims : some said to me , I had to prove that I would run up without through the streets ; others wanted me to stand up in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was only evil , and Photos@@ hop .
I have Kör@@ b@@ chen@@ Size C - what would I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this print ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some older people once spoke to my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic .
we cannot touch you because you &apos;re a religious wife , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much , and she lay down a rope around his neck .
luck@@ ily the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to switch to the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and just a few hours later , under the window , a car with a dark@@ ened window plate and a number plate with a 95 on top .
after it was the third time , it was clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human right friends rev@@ oked the number@@ ing plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give their names , but I will say that I remember them all , they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something strange happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without record , without ID , without paying anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw her into the tr@@ ash .
came to and check into the hotel .
the number was registered to a fore@@ igner .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe that you would be security , only because you have left the country ?
our people already know , in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ ers . you even know your room number .
just to prove you : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still stand in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a table theme .
some traditional Caucas@@ ian elements I still bear in me .
so much I wish it , I can &apos;t overcome this se@@ el@@ an barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I give it hard to look like the person you remember from their past - so remember my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed for ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the reason I needed some current information about the situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who spent one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an they were arrested and tortured , however , that all the end of the Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely , they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
thus , I mean , they probably charge the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; experienced by blood .
OC Media : are there even gay men detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine said , there &apos;s just not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives , or those of their relatives have been dropped to face the Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they are recorded there to present them later as terrorists .
say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base .
you understand ?
as if these people were not just disappeared , they are targeted specifically to radic@@ alise .
OC Media : is that only a mim@@ ing or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I &apos;m just someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after growing be@@ ard .
there have been nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was involved as these people were taken away .
until now they were not presented as band@@ its , but there were no reports until now . we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why should I not allow these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who are called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orient@@ ations have already occurred in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already familiar to the whole of Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was true , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much more secure than now .
Russia was originally intended to lead us to the &quot; Ci@@ vili@@ zation , &quot; ultimately , ultimately , in the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were stain@@ ed ; I had coloured eyelashes , bore a tube and a short tops .
the security department of the Sch@@ aria has never cleaned me only a hair .
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phr@@ ase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Save not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say to children , when they make merry .
OC Media : so they just shut up their eyes in front of you because they thought you were sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never ch@@ ased and never sm@@ itten me .
OC Media : how long kept this mercy time ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking about mor@@ ality in television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who had landed and laugh@@ ed before , viewed it once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
during the time , I left Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily decreases .
OC Media : what action do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ iter .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I still worked as a activist .
at the moment , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I comment with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize te@@ ac@@ ffs , past@@ ors , I am engaged to hospital and help them to get food cards .
I do not leave a cents .
I discovered these people themselves , when I found a refuge .
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear an Fiji ?
Sabrina : that is al@@ bern .
so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
that &apos;s exactly the same as Che@@ chens who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no co@@ ils in them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have what the Cab@@ ar@@ din@@ er have , the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet it is - but not in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it is un@@ pleasant to hear something .
I meet here so many men from the Caucas@@ us .
many of them - Muslim Muslims who walk to the mosque and while the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live together with men .
know , many think of tran@@ si@@ veness of men who love men , and they think that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a tru@@ ste@@ er .
these are two different things - two different kinds of emotion to be precise , different living settings .
for me , it is most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am right now .
local groups war@@ n against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ mad Arab community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ mad region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arabic population .
the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ mad Arab .
photo : use of permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 came to the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ mad community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ el@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child . he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that could rise in@@ ability to his family , such as Ah@@ mad human rights groups that would stay in Ah@@ mad and anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube was holding the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ ra hospital in the city of Ah@@ mad@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arabian Ah@@ mad minority , and activists in the place warned that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ mad Centre for Human Rights announced that this month , some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Say@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hung .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt in@@ flo@@ ated because of persecution from the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess , and in@@ capable to feed their families and pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ mad people suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large majority of the Arab people living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to dispute its living .
in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ z was an autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took power and had assumed great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in Ah@@ mad region , there are some of the largest in the oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing only slowly , and the native population receives only little of that wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illness , hunger and de@@ hydr@@ ation .
Iranian regime has denied the Iranian regime systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a number of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arabic areas in the Persian fields , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are lying .
these dam@@ s have led to destroy devast@@ ation in the region caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the local and pal@@ ms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi @-@ youth now increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian director of cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ mad who are looking for a job , completed 55 % a secondary school and took 45 % a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy &quot; aimed to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ mad human rights activist , with residence in London , declared Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist eth@@ n@@ ical discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ mad people .
Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly unemployment has become worse in particular . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic people and a anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since officials and institutions do not preferred Arabic labour , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi will de@@ duct access to working opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance young Arabs and force them to earn their lives outside their homeland of Ah@@ mad .
there are people who had to change their pre@@ dispos@@ ition and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ mad people , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , so@@ fter than speaking of the Arabic language or the dreams of Arab clothes .
given the given circumstances which the Arab Jama@@ hi@@ zi must endure , human rights activists strike the alarm before the situation will be explosive .
it remains to wait , whether the world is w@@ aking up and its knowledge .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avo@@ id@@ able .

&quot; why not uni@@ fy me with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional did not &quot;

the following article is an revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ ich@@ as and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions appeared .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who describe themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ strations .
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even put out scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money despite the same education as men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to making what they are allowed to do with her body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women come before or later in various fields of life to a gl@@ ac@@ ne ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender are still across the many different countries and cre@@ ations .
all this is aware and well known .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them .
I &apos;m a black woman .
and yet , if I have to talk about skin color , rac@@ ism , to black women in the LGB@@ T community or in black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I consider which type we have been physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , many white femin@@ ists were able to remain silent and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift their voices , and &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , &quot; to sing &quot; to sing &quot; to the equality of equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , we are subject to sexu@@ alised violence in addition to women who are subject to double @-@ fold nature .
or above that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and high@@ ways deserve less than white men and women .
black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school as white girl , due to apparent integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ ouses and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the other hand , I want all the women , all men and all men always have any skin color ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect to the black woman in whose center is the white woman who ref@@ uses to consider un@@ expect@@ ation in their thinking , referring to sex as well as to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and won &apos;t be strug@@ gling to fight my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist co@@ h@@ ous woman who always rejected me and countless other black women and always rejected .
in their speech in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner ordered 1851 in their speech : &quot; am I no women ? &quot; and also I refuse to maintain an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a deser@@ ted and mar@@ g@@ inal entity .
I refuse to join the groups that also absorb our customs and customs , to advance our customs and customs surrounding their eg@@ o@@ centr@@ alized program .
I will no longer try to commit white women about the importance of skin color and gender . because some of them continue to keep the meaning of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to revi@@ ve them .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different approach to a home and ren@@ dering the White femin@@ ism , the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; is still in his name .
I prefer to get rid of myself full and entirely of femin@@ ism and called me the motion of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism instead of using me for a white femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m , which is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever , that we define black women with our own ideas and give us into the spher@@ es that are created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves ) by means that we are able to defend ourselves with our own fashion , in which they may be completely sec@@ urely and in which the mental , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , after they read these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradic@@ tions of the femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , as I exist in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I &apos;m recognized as part of this para@@ dig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my existence .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither man@@ ned , nor ignored , nor is denied .
can@@ o@@ ing against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
To@@ dd &apos;s contribution to To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published in particular by international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
the Nabil Mus@@ a went back over the last 7 years - mostly with surf board or in the can@@ oe - with a special request by the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission aims to deliberately make people conscious of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ s@@ key we follow Mus@@ a , who explained us its relationship to the rivers of the region and the effects of pollution on its church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation of Water@@ ke@@ epers , a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance , which is committed to protect the rivers , streams , and water ways in Iraq , as well as supporting the local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the importance and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was filmed and published for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ s@@ key , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of their work is followed , little remarkable sub@@ cultures and characterized by using co@@ operative video photography and new multimedia techniques , with their help of supp@@ ressed municipalities which can tell their stories in their way .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; of Cur@@ r@@ als . the article is one of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # Re@@ f@@ n@@ g@@ inity ) , which report about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons affected .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she didn &apos;t have anything against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent .
since the end of her relationship , some time passed and the police said that their testimony would be laid down to the files , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was imp@@ aired because of abuse , the A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez showed nothing .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women are re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed at all , they are generally not receiving support from the State .
in many cases , women also financi@@ ally depend on the men who abuse it . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence in general in case of law en@@ forcement agencies .
in@@ durable stro@@ kes and Stati@@ st@@ 2 In@@ visible ab@@ uses and a legal system that has nothing @-@ ordin@@ ated 3 of Gross &apos; &apos;s laws : good approach , defective implementation of stro@@ kes and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are real man@@ age@@ able , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender research on Centro de Document@@ ación y E@@ ms , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that show but not even an@@ sat@@ in to demonstrate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
but the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General amounted to 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of them went violence against women .
86 % of ads added by the police .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence at the peace of peace . here , 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the indications 40 % of women , that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
this statistics , however , does not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to information provided by the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an female Secretary Ana Ba@@ i@@ ar@@ di only few of those off@@ ences are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of mental abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
for any woman who was re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; stated at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a crime @-@ continu@@ ance , prosec@@ utions are not reas@@ onably documented , as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
in August alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to its estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman is due to violence by men .

invisible missions and a legal system that takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was given the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that they named him the names of all her former friends .
at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she was after you .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe :
I never thought I would have become a victim of abuse .
when I read earlier this , I always thought that only women are going to sub@@ mis@@ erable , because they are fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about abuse by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship , and told how he isolated it .
many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked diar@@ rhoea , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave it before .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of ab@@ uses at least had some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria Santos , who was not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner had man@@ gled her .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimony of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with mental failure .
her wealthy partner eventually even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remain without Res@@ ult and also from its relatives , she has no support .
it led a process against her former partner who developed to become an in@@ descri@@ b@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country , where it mainly went to money , power , and the influence of her former partner .
Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not being applied .
the ad@@ ab@@ uses is a way full of resi@@ stances and a struggle against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems with the use of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , the bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ te ( # Für@@ th ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Una@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ natives ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law appears to explain Fem@@ izi@@ dal &apos;s original off@@ ences and harder to pun@@ ish as it is the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the text of law has changed in some points to also win the MPs for the law that fear the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions which currently has been banned in Paraguay and is sentenced to five years in prison .
the original bill intended to cost the bulk of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) travel costs which have to present the victims of violence even if they simply ref@@ res@@ ume and obtain safe accommodation in the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective , if the legisl@@ ature does not have sufficient financial resources available to it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of human relations .
here , one must take place , so violence is not considered a little more normal .
those who are silent in view of these facts , we@@ ars themselves and contributes to the perpet@@ r@@ ator of the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
we need to refund so long ad , no longer apply to abuse .
on 10 November 2016 , the Law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed , but amongst others a passage was deleted , which called the partners in cases of domestic violence on reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack his victims .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered to be a great blow .

independent media in Oman one year after ban a newspaper continue to attacks assault
&quot; this website was locked because of a decision of the information Minister &quot; on the homepage of the banned paper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arabian newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage of corruption in the Sultan .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a year @-@ in prison .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , and Z@@ ah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried by court but later released free .
Oman has ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn &apos; since 1970 who came to power after he had set up his father , Sa@@ ï@@ us Ta@@ im@@ ur , by heads of state .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Upper @-@ Chief of the Armed Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the insi@@ di@@ ous efforts of security forces , particularly domestic freedom , including press freedom , including freedom of press , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists in order to in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ cer@@ ate .
the authorities neutr@@ alize peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the area of human rights , also activists , to remind their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions on both online and offline .
the attack on the daily Az@@ am@@ n , its cl@@ amping , and the custody of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for freedom of press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported on corruption in Oman ( absolute monarchy ) since its foundation in 2007 until they were forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , who had appeared in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties involving hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; was published in the Ju@@ di@@ cial and the interference of high @-@ level officials .
in the report , government officials accused , judges of Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a judgment in an inheritance .

on 3 August 2016 , Z@@ ah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the promotion &apos;s Committee , was invited to the special department and was arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS adopted the deputy chief editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who , after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ an arrest , participated in Chief Editor .
the newspaper had been closed in@@ definitely after the information Secretary had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper on any way , including online from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on September 26 , 2016 , the first trial proceedings against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ cat .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted of inter@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; excav@@ ation of the government . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a public ban and sl@@ ander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year pen@@ alties and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year professional ban was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in jail and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after making use of an information network to spread materials that could represent a danger to public order . &quot;
a security deposit of 5000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was set for Al @-@ Abr@@ i and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appeals Court acquitted Al @-@ Abr@@ i &apos;s extradition hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months of prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 in prison by the central prison in Mas@@ cat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence .
the Appeals Court also decided the decision of the Information Ministry to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of the court to auth@@ ori@@ ze Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees itself as before attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information received an order that extended the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; to be extended three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further directive on which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister informed himself another time against the decision of the Appeals Court , the publication of the newspaper again .
the perpet@@ ual closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases linked to press freedom in Oman at recent times .
for further injuries , for example , the closure of the independent journal Mo@@ wat@@ in and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online paper of the country to stop their operation .
following the closure of Az@@ am@@ n and imprisoned journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the freedom of freedom of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the om@@ anic authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately release and un@@ condition@@ ally .
2 . a safe environment to create the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of press in the country , and
4 . under all circumstances , human rights advoc@@ ate and journalists take refuge in Oman their righ@@ tful human rights work and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial ver@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights violations ( including independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf Region and the right to gather themselves peace@@ fully , supported and protected against them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , image takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addressed one of the most urgent requirements of the continent .
for the demand on @-@ site medical research there are two reasons : for one missing in the offer of global healthcare systems , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover special medical needs on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have widespread impact elsewhere in the poo@@ rest countries in Africa , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a great problem .
second , research that is conducted by African scientists itself will only be eligible for the development of its own research capacities in Africa . a larger role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed first gra@@ zing effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he used himself on the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and over mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work on the application of research results . I also supported the sam@@ b@@ ische national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
moreover , I launch a research program for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important recent scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we just put solutions that have been developed differently .
this must change , otherwise , we will always remain the recei@@ vers instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions that we get , are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find appropriate scientists for projects ?
RW : from the United States and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or want to come here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and Internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import from other countries .
g@@ v : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age classes .
there are need of special scientific training , starting in every age .
social sciences , computer science , Big Data , exploration of the Wel@@ fare , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa over western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the basic access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) is also limited to the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the United States to India : how to change &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers the worldwide food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which has been reported on solutions to environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on already bred the let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ lining , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been set out only by its own income and the question as many of the sal@@ ami types can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he re@@ marked that more and more salads were patented , and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual types , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special rot@@ or , or spra@@ yed sheets .
over the past years , more of such patents have been registered for more plants such as grain or flash@@ cards . due to this trends , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security ensure the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still bred salad , but he now needs longer , since his work has always been frigh@@ tened because of getting more limitations .
&quot; it is as I lie in a river a rock that has to be bl@@ amed .
so we need to do that now , but it is a rup@@ ture with the tradition of tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go to far too far .
and when they stand before the court , no one can chast@@ ise a new sal@@ inity because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tried to breed the features that he wants .
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ oured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement connected in the US and in the world anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ der ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts at the International Space Station ISS have been cultivated and eaten red Roman @-@ sal@@ at of the &quot; greenhouse &quot; station of the station and eaten . there we have been tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name is rather like that it would come from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative of &quot; open source &quot; seed ) &quot; is inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software to provide the alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was set up in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property , and thus permanently used for plant bree@@ ders permanently .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can commit to it that others may use far@@ med seed freely .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders allow only others to breed their seed instead , to breed in such own varieties , and not immediately pres@@ elected - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant pat@@ ente .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the emer@@ itus professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i member board , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays an important role in larger inter@@ relations like biodiversity , rights of peasants , control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use the latter not or only little by eating seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg st@@ resses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement did not work with genetically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified , or not , for organic agriculture , says he and takes us to buy more frequently asked merger in the global agricultural industry , such as it will be offered for example to farmers markets , such as it is bred to farmers markets , such as this vegetable is bred .
food sovereign debt without seed @-@ confident people is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to make others their seed freely available to provide you with this , in contrast to this , seed and plant attributes .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supplies are je@@ op@@ ar@@ dised , as the Gen@@ etic pool is due to the increasingly variety of intellectual property rights on plant material that is always restricted , un@@ fail@@ ing .
Claire Lu@@ by , Managing Director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her PhD thesis with Gen@@ etic Vari@@ ation at carrots and its availability . it found out that about one @-@ third of all boxes are protected as intellectual property , which is either suitable for plant bree@@ ders either at all or less .
for other plants , such estimates are still not yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass@@ aging plants like wheat in even greater style can be patented as a salad or car@@ rot .
a question of sight
plants are bred in this way that they feature targeted features - of such , improves their taste or color , to such a source , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases .
ad@@ versaries of patents to plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing by increasingly more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four genes and cooperation with institutions such as the State Department of the United States , the company set up the preser@@ vation of genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property rights include other bree@@ ders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant diversi@@ fied innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent is expired .
often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result .
such a protection will not in@@ hibit innovation , but promotes it by making the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees this differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ elling , but certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait for such a long time to breed with plants , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the battle would have been lost .
however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general public and still should remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive to us .
we want to make farmers easier .
that is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to take advantage of the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept to patented the Plant @-@ features : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics of itself .
the plants form it themselves and , as bree@@ ders , we ultimately don &apos;t know how the plants do that .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i Executive Board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever bred a variety , also maintains its own values in them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with great farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for which cultivation of her@@ b@@ icides , are cultivated in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
my concept is very gent@@ ec@@ y . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are patents , they create the most smaller seeds , even without patents - either they reject it or maintain it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the opinion that bree@@ ders should be innovative by avoiding plant patented products : &quot; it looks like I do with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented .
I need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years itself , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent we are protected against competition 20 years before your opinion . &quot; global reson@@ ance
although the USA seem to be leading leading to the &quot; Open Source , &quot; the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is an open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . &quot; together with farmers , the center works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain demands .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed seed and sell its own .
the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an open @-@ source license that ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment to bree@@ ders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , because O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s obligation is not easy to use one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conventi@@ onally grown plants should not be pat@@ enti@@ ous . thus , she is referring to the present practice of the European Patent Office , the patents are allowed on conventi@@ onally grown plants .
one explanation is , however , not a law ; now it is involved in governments of the Member States , to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on the open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of plant banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to experience a little about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards promoting seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos;@@ Programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , for which scheduled next year will be the official starting signal .
a merger from environmental protection and development aid ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non@@ profit organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report must be allowed to contribute to seeds that can be replaced and contribute to the seed sector , so that a stable supply can be ensured .
in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphas@@ ized - a connection between Lu@@ by by O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will be seen .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has primarily considered , where , and how little is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now attemp@@ ting to clari@@ fy the people that more than their food is . &quot;

the Ukrainian Wikipedia has announced the eleven best photographers in the national part of the international photo competition &quot; Viking L@@ oves Earth , &quot; which focuses on wildlife monuments and nature reserves .
the prize @-@ giving ceremony took place on 7 October 2017 in the Museum of Natural Sciences in Kiev , where the winners &quot; photos were presented in an exhibition .
in the month of May , the Ukrainian part of the international competition received over 15,000 photos with more than 1,@@ 860 moti@@ fs on the subject of natural heritage .
about one thousand of these pictures are already available in Wikipedia articles , which are available in different languages .

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August the Egyptian government closed the website of the Tour Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about that .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step , critic@@ ised and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region .
in spite of this attack and the recognition of the Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities , to defend this goal , it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was not so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was confirmed that all technical possibilities were exhausted to overcome the blocking , and not review . we hope to continue our task further .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked my independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic language version of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based Network of Al Jazeera for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web lock@@ outs to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the major sources of human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ M@@ op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and Human Rights research scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada does not have access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for spreading colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now , the blog , which he addressed to circum@@ vent the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ ry apparatus of the Egyptian government , is the objective of a attack .
blo@@ gger , which is native to the Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video like the police accused physical violence against two students .
his article is mainly turning around politics and human rights issues in Egypt .
in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada was out@@ lined by the government and reflected what it means for him :
it is very old , but it is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It is successful to give me the feeling of a siege to me ; An arrest , a attempted murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , the blocking blogs , as well as any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to item from articles to avoid c@@ ens@@ orship .
now , however , after having locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the Mu@@ gen go the way up to an end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) closed Egyptian authorities from 24th May to 06 . August 133 websites . this erg@@ ents technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE , there also documented the blocking of providers , by transfer@@ ring internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 we saw how the pl@@ ying of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s had started .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter out the Egyptian users .
the situation is also intensi@@ fied by the fact that the C@@ ens@@ ur@@ ination decisions are hit behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis using them to proceed in court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
fighting the inhabitants .

daily newspapers in Brazil , with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home of many posters .
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old killed in school &quot; &quot; Each second day a police officer was killed in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves viol@@ ate pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ ers sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force in Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se @-@ ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years .
the International Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organisation Global Justice initiated even the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports about these are everyday life and this is un@@ acceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
the magazine published for the detailed coverage on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the Editorial &quot; That is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexu@@ al@@ ver@@ ting , etc . everything that has happened from the civili@@ zed standard and what only happened in Rio will be called &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : that &apos;s not normal !
this is the only alternative , so as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes to the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes declared that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that cannot recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist declared that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 territories there is one of the criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , when it is dist@@ orted , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police that sho@@ ots first and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and their partner .
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than they use ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed that violence as a &quot; war &quot; argu@@ ed that this would be a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to draw the responsibility for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of the field interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory investments in personnel , education and a historical and sel@@ f@@ ily negle@@ ct of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent spot in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date information .
no such cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we look at the Mor@@ rates per state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; she writes .
specially , the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , emphas@@ ises such as Cec@@ í@@ lia , the number of security policy in the State for years .
one of these safety policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer the fav@@ ela of a massive police unit and station@@ ed a unit permanently there .
in the beginning , this resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . since a few years , the U@@ PP took to protect the police and pres@@ sions against the poor municipalities which should actually protect the neo @-@ created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles published in 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio won &apos;t represent the criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; by the Geneva Convention .
he writes :
besides legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for people .
for this calls for the state , means and ways to use typical for war . this includes int@@ ru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is a non @-@ sharp point in the countryside and for the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; and &quot; ver@@ itable balls . &quot;
war or her , fact is that the residents of Fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
one week it is now that police have kl@@ ash the mountain to the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ char@@ ist died due to shots that had fired the police from a helicopter .

source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly through the Assad regime .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X Peace Organisation and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the East G@@ hou@@ ta region is particularly strong , where an attack with chemical weapons required the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these have been controlled by rebels controlled by the siege of Damascus , which led to the fact that inhabitants rely on locally produced or qu@@ il@@ ted foods with tun@@ nels and control points .
by the years of block@@ age , traditional food supplies such as meat has become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
in consideration , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms not belong to conventional , planted in Syria , and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besie@@ ged east G@@ hou@@ ta .
the right of the project , subscription Nabil , said to the French news agency AFP :
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate the cultivation of fung@@ us because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that had been fighting for three years ago to make this project announced , and pushed out his relief that it will now win more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to con@@ vey 125 families of knowledge to plant mushrooms , Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations on Can@@ Do .
the initiative is reli@@ ed on generators , which maintain the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ ages , locally manufactured greenhouse gases are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of pilgrims from the regions of pilgrims , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
afterwards they planted a small mushroom court in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a bigger bowl . and so on .
now they have developed a &quot; apprenti@@ ce yard for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout the east G@@ hou@@ ta for free .
Dr. L@@ eila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ us for different reasons &quot; : fraction of siege .
delivering a new food source on the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by eating habits ( such as paper , tea , coffee fish , cardboard , etc ) will be used to extraction new food@@ stuffs .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , who are bound to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our struggle against hunger and siege is visible .
we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot;

Portuguese calls for Justice for the Vic@@ tims of 2017
several hundred people were protest@@ ant on 21 October in many neighbour@@ hoods in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that gr@@ ated in the north of Portugal in the week .
two @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between the 15th and 16th October . this led to that the government proclaimed last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires are also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 light bur@@ sts that spread to the north and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Pe@@ dr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande was a similar tragedy , where the fires gave 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry monitoring system , which supervised the forest areas by satellite photos , there are about 500,000 acres of forest in 2017 , covering an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so you can make a better picture of Ernst the situation : there is no fire in 4 bor@@ ough@@ s .

the fore@@ see@@ able tragedy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the requirement for better pre@@ emp@@ tive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to con@@ com@@ fy the extent of tragedy as far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al , by the federal government of Portugal , declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
according to Pe@@ dr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did nowhere : there are dozens of reports from open streets , surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits in est@@ r@@ ities are in@@ jected with high spirits .
a far reaching proposal for the forest , which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , has been communic@@ ated by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle to investment .
&quot; the government led a bill of the law that allowed the construction activity of the case , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection , that was an open back@@ door that everything could be built , &quot; João Sor@@ val is continuing the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made it carefully that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of light @-@ flamm@@ able wood , as in a v@@ icious circle , continues to spread to the fires of this kind .
to these problems , the website of the Civil Protection Act of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , sought out as a population information or attempted to contact relatives , relatives was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used its own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time via the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers of João P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so crucial that the servers were over the 400,000 users who pursued the fires , not ste@@ ady : there were more than half a million .

the way from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs

in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible war was broken between the different Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a land of terror and desp@@ air .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family dinner together .
even though his mother never said it at that time , she knew that she would no longer see her son - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat , was killed just by the Taliban and felt indig@@ nant with Haz@@ ara .
the Taliban dra@@ gged along for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara well @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ hes@@ itation . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left out of his minor salary , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and to@@ wed bags with mort@@ ars that were heavier than he himself to make himself up his living .
at that time , Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan Refu@@ ge@@ es ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked also .
there was no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so we don &apos;t be sha@@ ken at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day meal in needy .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . it is also true , however , that the conditions that seek@@ ers asylum seek@@ ers are cat@@ astro@@ phic .
the human rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , &quot; the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; special recording centers &quot; at this time , with impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to the Italian Law , asylum seek@@ ers can then be allocated to a admission center if officially put an application for asylum -@@ which can still be passed after the registration of the asylum seek@@ er .
up to then people who have no money for accommodation , either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road .
so it was also called A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ stable life@@ times helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions .
after having made various works in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af had its entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
it went so well that he opened a second hostel after a while and a schn@@ el@@ lim@@ b opened .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ at@@ is Suc@@ cess Story is now subject of documentation &quot; Behin@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - an Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , several of Afghanistan served companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of its Restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ it@@ ers and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu tells about the various Afgh@@ ani , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the story of their trip to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opens the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also in Afghanistan too .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to go far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade , and aim to the country that he had to be forced to leave as teen@@ ager .
&quot; where an risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happy if I know my people suffers .
I plan a project for farmers from the poo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the company and have to get the same possibilities like all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also ador@@ ns plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul in which the people can learn packaging and preserv@@ ative techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their crops on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubts but in the end stands stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he would like to help other Afghanistan in this way .

the Egyptian Parliament will examine a bill of law that fore@@ sees social media such as Twitter or Facebook can only use after a registration at a government authority .
users would have to be able to use social networks in order to register their social networks within six months of the order of the authority , stating their complete name as well as their identification number .
those who are missed this step could be sentenced to six months in prison , or the en@@ forcing of a criminal payment .
the law , which was applied by sixty @-@ Parliament members , is currently ob@@ taining to the legislative and Constitutional Committee of the Parliament , and should be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of the Chamber of Dep@@ uties filed a legislative proposal on the har@@ dening of the president or a high official officials .
under Egyptian law the offensive President as well as government institutions are already stra@@ ci@@ ble . however , under the law proposition would have become a kind of prison terms and fin@@ es , right @-@ wing of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , it can mean by up to three years in prison for the convicted .
in addition , this would strengthen political climate in which the right to free expression of expression and freedom of freedom has already existed in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers , demonstr@@ ating violence against protest@@ ers who had led against the military put@@ sch of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 participants who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison on a trial date .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison line according to human rights groups failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan thre@@ aten the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups belong to , including arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ F@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous years , from 25 to 5 years .
tun@@ es@@ ic activists li@@ stens to un@@ ick@@ ened documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was primarily associated with an en@@ ce@@ ful action plan . according to the plan specifically a controversial draft bill was supported , the business@@ men and during the former regime used by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption of accused official amnesty .
this document , published on 21 April , published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , poses a light to look like the presidential plans for the support of the legisl@@ ature .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the name of its sources stating the Tunis@@ ian press code that journalists sec@@ ures the right to protection their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness .
will China force social media to en@@ force its identification ?
according to new rules on the information offices of the People &apos;s Republic of China , social media in China need permission to write or share messages in social media .
in addition , the rules will also be stated that registration with the full name will be required .
analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments in the social networks should be reached within the social networks . it is un@@ clear , how the authorities apply this regulations .
Chinese Citi@@ zen has proposed in social media to protect these regulations only sel@@ ec@@ tively to protect civil journ@@ alism and independence .
