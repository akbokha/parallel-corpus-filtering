<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, American authors have danced, American authors and operated with sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, this country had a so-called profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of a American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who had uncovered the murderous conspiracy by Julia Roberts as Jura-Studi, who wanted to occupy his interest in the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was it, as if it's absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA was further strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I ever lived with its diversity so inviting, that you are always the one you are and it is easily Acceptance within a community of convent people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shy love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the intolerance and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me, how he goes with his narrow-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never believes in his opinion just behind the mountain, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he is considering, as a former colleague put it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his testimonies and approved in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with Republican Presidential elections was the highest number who ever reached a nominated candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this authentical person, I asked?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not tune Trump and electors with people who I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, takes up the people from around the world, a deeply believing man, with whom I managed to entertain me about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also Trumps did not agree with the worldview of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity which I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who experienced her life for the environment and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who helped me with much patience and wormwood and my colleagues, to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice has helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by they embodied values deepened my love in America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump led his way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out to be the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans gave the presidency to a man, although - or maybe because of his contempt toward non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they were either against racism and fanatism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, broke almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call Trump-voters as a racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful and implies an inability to understand those who deal with another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes are not taken into account in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these electors, of which the most knows, have voted for Trump, because they want to win control over a country they are disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, would they possibly say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments the fierce decision to raise a man who look down with contempt upon those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm. WC.: as much as "rebellion of white against all other ethnicities"; wordplay from white to white and whiplash, as the great Van Jones named, exactly what America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether the myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which faith or background you like, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">Because this country has chosen as its President, twice the son of a kenianers, whose story as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America's promise and says: to hell with complexity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at rest, say they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who is in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">As a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd's crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump," son, captain Humayun Kahn, had a place in your America? "Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roaring the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"did Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your US? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they shouted and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a consistent and loud "NEIN!"</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "God is thanks to Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land which his son had fallen, sent a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now that is Trumps Land, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaian town of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played on both places, not only the life of children has changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, who lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds apart from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a couple of years now, the La Banda de Música Auditorium (music band) in the village: one of the children and adults of existing Symphony Orchestra, which has found an opportunity for overcoming her poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and the Banden Violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had so rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with shining eyes and play in the guile you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Mühlander</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically above the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital of Paraguay - on instruments which are made of re-transfered waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments which consist of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling of Favio Chávez began to turn parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violins, violins, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all manufactured from the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan, Latin American music and the music of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez remembers a local ecologist and musical teacher of the children of Cateura:</seg>
<seg id="87">First, it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the children had no music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he never had seen before: one made of trash made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is an entire orchestra appearing on instruments made of re-prepared material and that the Recycled Orchestra is called.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the trouble - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork can effectively fight illegal fishing</seg>

<seg id="100">It was known in West Africa that this ship had already been operated in Liberia's waters of illegal fishing before it was searching for the other African coast.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were about to be applied accordingly, and much inclined to welcome the seeds of this species at its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Komore, Mozambique and the Seychelles "mobilised quickly against the ship. they refused to buy one of their harbours and refused to lend him a fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" Benedict Kiilu "recalls a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing agency. it is part of a team that discovered the ship back in time and followed.</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch a fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia for a predation of the country's stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative that crosses a criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegally Fishing (stop Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">Members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar, six countries who then had driven the Premier out of their waters.</seg>

<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden when it is extremely difficult to track. that's illegal fishing a leading cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By intentional misregard of existing laws which are supposed to be protected by certain habitats and types, the illegal fishing ecosystems may harm a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, during actions against illegal fishing once were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and through the snow-empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions now happen in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange, for example, lists any existing licenses, news for suspicious activity or details that you notice or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open sea, with satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships which fishing in banned areas - such as suspicious driving routes - such as those who point out that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal situation, such examinations may show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the way and possibly, whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, on the basis of these information, can refuse to accept such ships in their harbours. what does the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that even numbers of penalties could be forced, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>

<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a representative firm that assists for illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenues, which lose eight members of the HISH-i network each year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing industry, which attracts the region of commercial fishing in around the world. among these also one such illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other things, actions include like sailing under false flag, fake license papers, indication of phantom species, fish protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>

<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and exactly this legal sipflok tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed against criminals, which revealed counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. there were ships that used several fraudulent identities and found wings and found refuge.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his collaboration with INTERPOL, the international agency for fighting crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations have led us quite far into the networks of organisational crimes," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that is supposed to help FISH-i, suspicious ships in detail.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, helps reduce the illegal ships to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chef analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO also deals with fisheries data and technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automated identification systems, such as they can no longer be ortet by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different information systems. it should help FISH-i to find criminally agating ships with a bigger precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But may FISH-i's team of African nations indeed take effect on the unquestionably global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch Platform. it offers a platform that offers satellite data, and through which the position of each traceable ship can be displayed worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="141">We should do this at a global level. "" Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project running on which a global system provides tracking of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities do not only feel crime, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had been overfished without license and hard with consequences, now know that they are watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries participating at FISH-i have now accounted for a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia helped to track down Greko 1, they found inspectors there on board sloppnets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries gathered together to the so-called West Africa Task Force. however, they now also fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i. "" With security, the goal is to develop even more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's recently announced its first major triumph in October: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was under a false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used toddlenets which are meanwhile banned.</seg>

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seems to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum for the sension of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the Government of Venezuela has rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a counterpart, the Venezolans responded to negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in their eyes, having gathered themselves on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the order of Venezuela) can be found both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the region Barinas, in the Andes regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central north of the federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the federal state of Nueva.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country deteriorates continuously, what makes it noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezolans by an acute lack of food and drugs.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the Opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the prebuilding of the current president Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately, the deposition of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, co-acting in Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government statement as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and geckakes belong to the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far reaching lack of food and medicine was to give the country the chance to rebuild his institutional structures and join a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral political alliance of Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (approximately: round table of the Democratic Party) linked to the elections of 2015 to the majority of representatives of the National Assembly. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on Tortgetag and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government, should continue to pass on November 3.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was stated on Twitter among other things as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is far as far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday national strike and on 3 November all to Caracas at Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, images that talk about disputes, as well as reports from oppression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially great waves beat the report on police repression in the central-located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">Protesters return to the local cathedral there, to protect themselves according to their own testimony before the police and armed supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later, they were able to leave the cathedral again, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andestate Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira bear no skirts, because you could see something that many National Park didn't have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an Infographic makes the round, which detects the magnitude of suppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">So the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a counterbalance procedure - this has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless men on the road.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs are:</seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado claim that 1% of the signatures are fake.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your counterpart!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the road!</seg>
<seg id="189">Others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that made a little against the devastating economic crisis from their perspective, and would rather be dealing with critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They have taken us so much - but also fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The marches are always taking more in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview of Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano who was originally released on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to visit the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano said in the province of Cordoba in the great La Perla-Ribera trial in Córdoba, towards his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process that ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined that were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano hasn't visited his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden, same name as his father, to bear the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years, he retained his family secrets to himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">When child is 15 years old, you don't know that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not recognize that my father was a thief, a foler, and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmerieter. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father of 1976 to 1978 was a deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressed, who was charged for kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father started to take me up to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was fried with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All they called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have been friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Passport just doesn't want you to escape a day and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation of ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, the Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back into the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would be obeyed.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. my father had brought me up.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'then the prisoners are subjected to torture'</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times at La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he ordered me to go out. he led me to a baracke, in the cars, furniture, television, refrigerators - everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small piece of crispbread and ordered me to wear it into a car. when I opened it, I saw that it was a big clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other end of the Baracke where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with an outpost.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed out into an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I was paralyzed, and saw a lying, tortured on man.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a dirt and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attach it to an end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body's body, which was spelt right there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They grabbed a man with handcuffs on the bed, overthrown him with water and chased a cargo of 220 volts to genitals.</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: comisión Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The smell there was horrible... as a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another?</seg>
<seg id="248">'I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father started to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were bound with handcuffs and wore it.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke to "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a Civilian who was also indicted on the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a series of mattresses, on which naked people lay down with the face down - all were bound at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Near the entrance, people were silent on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners, he said, "Why do you look like, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I met "Why didn't you brought me out?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and was killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Besides La Cuadra there were some rooms known as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know "Palito" Romero struck a man there and killed.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of declassified a number.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into cuadra until the arrangement of the above came, that they should be relocated.</seg>

<seg id="269">At that time, I had no idea what the "war yield" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But as I was later when the military was, - I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bayonet or maybe military signs which one receives one enemy that is fought against.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if you enter into a house and the fridge, the turntables, clothes, paintings, money... boots, then that's no war yield but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I was always asked how my father, the leader of security forces, could join this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminal and I said: and you whom you beat on the road?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are no criminals?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded anger, struck me, and cried, saying,</seg>
<seg id="282">When you go so far, I will find you and embrace you.</seg>

<seg id="286">As I said in the process, I showed a photo of at that time, on which I wore a jacket and a pullover of wool. both had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defense accused me to have been a fellow literal of this crime. I answered, no problem, they can lay mine on what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="295">So good. so, during the dictatorship of the dictatorship, you have vanished. but what did the bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kids carry out children?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with home, whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">You could not have been able to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but what did their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families who could have passed their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the dead is the last abbous act, which one can do to man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remnants of the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence in the last month, witnesses of a very particularly failed translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">In a sign the Japanese word (koreiuntensha), which means "older drivers" means, falsely - maybe also with a Bohemian background thanks & # 8212; as a "horrible car driver."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1-20.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was in common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also, who made his attention to the local artist loids.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun daily negotiated the Kyoto protocol:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult for elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable, "Holmes said.</seg>
<seg id="356">The incorrect English translation was initially removed. the term "(German:" awful motorists ") was later replaced by the more reasonable, although grammatically not entirely correct designation" Elder Drivers "(German:" older drivers ") was replaced.</seg>
<seg id="357">The police in Kyoto has been apologized for the translation errors. furthermore, it explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had been found from translators that the translation was not checked to their accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger was reported as follows the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sorry that older people felt by inadequate correction (the translation) in our part," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-cast News was somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the "horrible" older motorists in Japan apart and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denouncing as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older motorists, who are involved in accidents, is quite worried.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors. this represents a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors 1.803 caused a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">Thus their share increased to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents fell in total, the proportion of seniors caused accidents has risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The reputable reporters offered in the published version of the article comments on the light that show the prejudices a few Japanese seemingly against older motorists:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo on the translation errors, among others, received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" fearless drivers ") about reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">- "so erroneous is the translation really not, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="370">- "I don't think that is a true translation error."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translators are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the output text and learn active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active command of target language - something that is in the mother's speakers. in general, the persuasion that translators should be in the initial language - not in the language language.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French native language should translate by English into French, not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ employees with English as a mother tongue that could make translations into English. this may lack a lack of understanding for the overtaking, cost reasons, or the relatively low number of English speakers that are to be Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees can make translations still firs. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is ranked as the best, become a translator, no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbal and mystifying phrases that are created by machine translation is shown that this technique can still not replace human translators for a long time. this applies to several languages entirely.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English forums in Japan, including the enigmatic pressurings that often use t-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistically reasons - not to be read or understood even.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry or at least harmless. however, of big companies or from the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto uses hopefully a serious source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="392">Friday morning, April 7, the Venezuelan Internet user used to have no access to the online transmitter Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, another user wrote that Internet disappearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are also no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels also contributed to the record of the protests in Caracas that were organised by oppositional groups that resist the Nicolás Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court themselves.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the findings of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is curved, and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="403">Amazing, that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEIN filtro confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by a blocking of the domain name System (DNS), but also two other online stations. this also affects the website where the National Assembly transfers their meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Former research institutes of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, revealed that the local Internet service providers can be able to vacate DNS. in this case, it concerns a technology which incorrectly answer the DNS servers of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server uses incorrect or refuses the request to call such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ eladoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>

<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also announced that the government regulates the Internet connections, so the Venezolanians will always make access to multi-media coverage of the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series titled "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools") organized by Global Voices in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a budget in which she had not allowed to eat together with the family that was allowed to eat.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on them. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">Those who have become something, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began working as Criadita for the family. when Criaditas is known as Criadita in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is quite simple: a big family with a little money transfer their minors' son or her underage daughter to another, abundant family. in exchange, the child receives food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to offer countless days of household work that will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse, and all this in the framework of a contract you cannot raise.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, called Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of its involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite the symptoms of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After her graduation, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She talked with Criaditas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected witness, replied and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call the things given by name, as the feeling of gratitude is vaccinated by the Criaditas, but in general silence shall not be silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double illusion," Alvarenga explains.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the other hand, the family that their daughter is in the faith that they conclude their education, improving their position in society and "something out of itself" can be handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that overtakes the girl with itself and justifies the exploitation by faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise be no training, and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will be experienced many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experienced.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the unseen in paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of severe droings. shortly afterwards, she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military group Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who works as an official for residents.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín was living in their home in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants and 250 kilometers east of Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">Ferreira, ended in late January 2016 with a stick on Marín until they suffered deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment of the young girl's life.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the child was Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply responsible in the paraguayan society of the Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They recorded the Criadazgo as a "modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest together, asking that there could be no further Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," mourned Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to injure the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it's very difficult to control, among which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of married couples and almost 60 civil society organisations requested an independent investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was Criadita, to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case is before the Court, the case of Carolina Marín will be landmark - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Criadazgo before judgment.</seg>
<seg id="454">Everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik worked in which her father worked to register, and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all work and began to sell, on the street or on the market sweets, to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent when Criadita was sent to the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employer Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that it was still time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">It stood every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for example, clean the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at an end, she returned home and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they worked together with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but did not get unlimited food. "I was allowed to take more books from the library of the Household as food from the refrigerator," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the householder, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who had been in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">Some of the landlords of the Houseerr Alvarenga, alongside him and Editorial from Oppositioning panels, such as "Sendero," or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to convince her to grant the reports of the official media on the dictator of the dictator.</seg>
<seg id="471">He thought she was intelligent, but did not entertained himself with her. "the master of the house had found someone who heard, while he talked about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they don't allow me to visit my family, because they were the opinion that I would again learn" bad habits, "that Alvarenga, who belongs to the indigenous group of Guaraní, would speak their mother tongue to Guarani.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that she would have enabled her to lose, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">She was completely clear, however, that she had paid for everything she had paid for them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Even in school Alvarenga discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never talked about, mobbing and the chicans are exposed to those Criaditas, when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone home. I didn't have friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time where friendships arise, I felt especially clear that I was one of the group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The insulation was the worst of everything, "Alvarenga explains.</seg>
<seg id="480">The company cheap the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="481">In January 2015, a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share career opportunities for cleaning personnel and children's girl in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="482">The administrative director of the group is Pepa Koweanovsky, a city council in Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="483">Hi! I'm looking for a little friend for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her.</seg>
<seg id="484">Learning how to learn.</seg>
<seg id="485">Please call you.</seg>
<seg id="486">Starting from Monday, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="487">The ad received five "Likes" and many comments.</seg>
<seg id="488">A woman from the place Ñemby wrote that she would have a young girl and gave their telephone number.</seg>
<seg id="489">Another woman who also came from Ñemby, provided her 15-year-old niece. "she likes little children and is very attractive," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="490">The third comment was written by "a girl from the inner inner court that wants to work."</seg>
<seg id="491">Then the author of the ad switched itself once again:</seg>
<seg id="492">Dear friends, I have found one. I watch if it works with it.</seg>
<seg id="493">Thank you very much, I am writing again if something is.</seg>
<seg id="494">The business was completed.</seg>
<seg id="495">In the Prolog of the report Criaditas, ¿hasta cuándo?</seg>
<seg id="496">(Criaditas, how long nor?), a collection of witness testimonies given by former Criaditas, writes Ortiz:</seg>
<seg id="497">In the course of our history, we have managed to abolish systems such as slavery, Cuñadazgo (a practice of early history), the Conquistadores who gave them tribute to the Spanish conquerer in Paraguay, and the Spanish conquerer in which the Spanish conquerer had to settle in a system of slavery, in which they become easy victim to abuse and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="498">The social inequality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Criadazgo.</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian Parliament approved a draft bill to agree with regulations regarding the use of the use of social networks. "</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is accepted by the Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt by a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law then a place would then be set up to exploit civil rights and citizens to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register with their correct name and identity numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do this, it may have a punishment of up to six months in jail or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs, consists of six paragraphs, including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defined social media as "jedwede application, which is running via the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video monitoring and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is passed when it is accepted, as Egyptian authorities have no indication to impose the user's users, not to register with the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is unable to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliament of Parliament and promoter of the Legislative Law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered user names and users supported a user name and a password to get through the firewall that blocked Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to set a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to those of the Egyptians, it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has so far not known that such plans consist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (German "Senior Research") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, German "Egyptian Initiative"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I double in the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have technology to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they make it so clear that just as they keep forcibly physical public and private spaces that could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, this means that they are implementing a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who require authorization or do not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them a trial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislative elections and the Constitutional Committees, before it comes to the debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the design is in line with a pro-military thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the image surface, "says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the Tamer El-Shakty proposed a legislative case against cyber crime, in which a life-long sentence for those who were intended to be found guilty of threatening "public order" and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza in the video shows, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the increase of the ecosystem, depends on that a big predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopards in the wild wild is small and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore stipulates that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera's all, breaks Raza in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="544">Documented in early March 2017, the newspaper Kahoku Shimpo carried out the progress made in the last six years to rebuilding the life of the "threefold disaster" of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture, in Japan, had to experience the earthquake and resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring farms of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to vacate, because the tsunami had vanished entire coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even more, Fukushima prefecture had one nuclear disaster in the Fukushima prefecture, only some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows a local view which progressed over six years later to rebuilding the life of local people.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper covers both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and a survey results of the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare-houses (rule, saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi recorded the greatest achievement among the three prefectures. here, 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima still represents the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even though, six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behel's accomodations (by rule, kasetsu juutaku), were still trying to settle in final spare houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there still lived 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in an emergency, whereas Miyagi was successful in 2011. more than 75 percent of the evacuated living after the desaster were settled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of works and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 visited 1,100 schools that were affected by misfortune, its gates until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation again, 30 percent of the fishing ports have recovered their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear issue, have caught a large scale in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear waste, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of cultivated farmland from Fukushima, are in the "nuclear waste zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has continuously recovered, but here again Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back up to 90 percent on the same level as before misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, there can only be 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of coastal inhabitants, it has been more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major quakes?</seg>
<seg id="570">To obtain a complete picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and under the evacuated by. she questioned them about the status of reconstruction and also how their reception has changed over the tsunami-risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami-awareness among native people living in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local people have taken action taken in order to be prepared on future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that it was still not enough in the disasters associated with disasters.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has amplified its attention also to the location of the evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima still had to experience only the enormous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was witness of the worst, catastrophic caused, nuclear waste that has ever had to experience in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people from Fukushima from Fukushima were transferred to almost 63 000 people in the area outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, there were more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima and had been resettled in permanent replacement parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">Still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside of their home prefecture in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes areas most of the evacuees, still more than 50 years old, are known because the efforts to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. here, it is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, one recognizes however often that one more unites than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important because they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately is very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely related these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast, we treat issues that often get less attention in the reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly associated with someone about speech and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Criconman talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egarasa speaks to how the love of music has been working for common language skills during a journey in rural China; Adriana Macias speaks about the time, where it has collected with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experience, which he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was given this week into an intensive care unit: last Friday a police officer was defeated at Goiânia in a demonstration in Goiânia. nationwide, millions of protesters took part in a protest against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the Universitität of Goiás, has suffered a skull-trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him this Saturday and have now translated it into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His state is regarded as critically.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which quickly rapidly spread in Brazil during a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures there is also the face of the police officers, which was attacked with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident of the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he proposes in Goiânia, with his impact stock on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (Photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">A police officer would beat from a demonstrators and land on intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, divided by Luiz da Luz, who sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officers and put a number of sanctions on it.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but from another perspective, is also immersed in the social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below, one sees the attack on Mateus down from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family who lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilians (approximately 2,700 euros) in order to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay at Goiânia while he is in hospital.</seg>

<seg id="613">Goiás experiences a wave of political violence: here, the Activist Guilherme Irish was murdered here, because he was stabbed to criminalise the Occupy Movement in Secondary School. and now we have been attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who was attacked by a policemen who had attacked him with a stroke stock.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police convictions</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only country in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen set at protests in the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators wanted a stage for Redner, Gummigrade and Tränengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to abandon violence against protesters.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again the Brazilian media street protests confuses to focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window disk.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a cervical glass windows to illustrate their title pages illustrative.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a title story with a set-up bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason, more than a broken window disk than the protests of thousands of people who serve a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This is necessary to recognize if one is strictly damage to any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" is a absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violence of the military police are communicated by headlines with the title "demonstrators on the confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">Drafting of the Discriminalisation of forgotten villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Law of Álvaro Reynoso, there were almost hundreds of sugar production factories throughout Cuba. (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - unaware that there is no notable sugar-harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago, when the activities were placed in the sugar production factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the earthquake the sugar industry was still in the region, and the factory lost gradually after its plants, until only the smells of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to be reinvent.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others signed and commute one daily to the factories that are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Sola veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis is not robbed of the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar-factories in the east of the region, which are back in operation after a long period of time because they were given.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers to have heard that in MañalI would get the sugar oil factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar industry subsists in plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, the insufficiency, the bad administration decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced quantity.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country for a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old train station in the village saw already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar tubes were technically obsolete, and hardly more competitive they were inconceivable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate the production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories, which can produce sugar for the most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar prices rose from about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars will remain in pounds between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 survey from the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"the day of today's day will go into history" - these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">During the following years, the breastfeeding of 98 cane mill factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar tubes factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene is known as soldier is known about the closure of the factory, the word that he repeats the most, "betrayal."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents say the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the initial publication, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was unwritten documents, which only differed in terms of parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, but only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was transferred and the letters came becoming more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge for the breastfeeding factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still operating sugar production factories," he insured.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years waiting for the retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will at the breastfeeding of the factory, where the construction he helped, took part.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and its most important job generators was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases there were no alternatives for working and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the Mammut speech of October 21, 2002, then the then president in the eyes of those present people saw when he assured that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation since five years.</seg>

<seg id="672">The sugar cane has been extracted only highly since 2004.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years, the People's Congregation Gregorio Arleé Mañali learns that many things change, but not getting better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar factory completed, or even better, when they began to end it, they also stopped to assign the road, this also disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with already advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to search other factories.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youths from the first Nations communities in the whole of Canada deals with topics that are important for them. they do not do with hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">Since 2014, as part of the N 'we Jinan-tour, workshops are direct to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups, songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were directed by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in northern Quebec in ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop-Gruppe The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop advances that the young people talks in discussions like "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptance," or whatever is happening in the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo, in the field of the tribe of the Kitsummonum First Nation in British Columbia, explains the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," on which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women have disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were not fully explained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important is preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences through the globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in Indigenous languages, although the youngsters have not always rule the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapothooi Cree First Nation have recorded, the chorus will be sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved a little help from Gary Jolly von der Northstars Hip Hop Group, who gave them a verse in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as well as translation into English, translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel, nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to go further my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That's the day you will lose our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way to life in our life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and lead our youth as well</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do that, what the Creator has determined</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it can be seen in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, what exactly is on the menu, will be found near the entrance of the shokuhin sanpuru (by rule, "plastic models of dishes") from each dish that will be served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers are looking at these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of this plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the district of Kappabashi there is a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes, which the German filmmakers Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese are these plastic dishes so usually that they do not even notice them. a new trend is turning today in conspicuous mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">In Naver Matome, the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuk sanitu.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now on sale: new with plastic dishes decorative chains, like they will be shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food were turned to kitschy collectibles, as in this case, refrigerated magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some shocks refrigerated magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the essences has increasingly become more elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular travel bowl with seafood) was turned into a cell phone support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">This part is also made for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an Apple who holding your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the cell phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of a growing flight into the county.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon sals is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there anybody who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can get my mobile phone with laughing?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also receive a less appetite, for example colleagues or family members unpleasantly surprised.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melmelts ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), Earrings and handlebars from dried salmon.</seg>

<seg id="745">A Mexican project tells stories of the surviving of fighting against the organised crime</seg>
<seg id="746">"for the sacrifice of fighting against the drug dealers."</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports from domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against the drug trafficking" in Mexico, the mists and gearings regularly show up only in statistics. however, this reflects the extent of human tragedy that brings this struggle with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, the boss of Sinaloa cartel, urged the stories of the conflict entirely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looking for the people who have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind each bone, in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, their wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal animal político has set up the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug dealers living)," the victims are supposed to have a voice and told stories of people involved in the struggle between prosecutions and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The implications are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and all municipalities have to leave many kilometers, to buy something like milk as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear lives") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father that digging secret tombs every weekend after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father by only one day, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "like every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task again today that we have asked to go and to graves, after the people we loved we are looking for."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13, he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he was back again, but he never came back. "Emma Veleta:" it's very difficult for me, because I'm now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship.</seg>
<seg id="769">My mother, too, is my mother, too.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are entitled to my father's insurance, but it does not pay them out because there is a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors "Aprender a Vivir con el narco" explains why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only demonstrate the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility, and the government.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, regardless of what it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have seen the disease and sensorial journalism now for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come over to newspaper kiosks every day and see the cover pages with pictures, which actually only can come from a textbook for criminology or academics of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes, I feel like I am the only one who joined or sad. it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be either valid, or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old Cousin thinks he is Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is great. and it is also not normal that people listen to songs about the "heroism" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, that, as if they would have lost those who have lost someone, and those who fear that they are also something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, if stories are to be exposed numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inaction of mankind is incredible for me when death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbour that they are justified "were justified."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to argue that they are spared from such tragedies, when they are not stirred and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months Expressations in the main city:" it describes how armed detective month spent money from their business until they were destroyed by the end not only the business but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything you lost, and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further, away from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will deduct you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these dreadful days if even weeping would dissolve my deep root emotions, but the answer is no, because I don't forget how to weep. I must learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a madness that he had to teach himself how to make a egg, potatoes, tortillas, keep warm and "Chichi" for the babies that make with him. this is his name for the preparation of flacon with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">However, they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - indescribable to a boy for all life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody dead body of his father saw that had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez did look like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mingled by the organised crime and struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings on public safety and government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Public Prosecutor's Office (3103 murders) numbered between 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories living in the face of becoming the new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," the objective of data journalism-project Spcodati in 2015, whose goal consists to depict the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades, in a comprehensible way.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment that it is about to raise a rumor, or to debunk a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, inclined to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) seven years ago.</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it was used irregulating, tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false copy of picture and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in terminology by Global Voices or First Draft News - deny not the fact that there is abundant coverage of events in the DRC, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">However, we ask questions about our desire for pictures to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a road tanker entered the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped and exploded. 230 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the Civil War, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and devastated. the streets in the region became aggravated full of whistholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, he fell victim to the tank.</seg>
<seg id="828">Ladenial representatives described a fireball that envelops dozens of houses including a movie nearby, which was full of people who clearly illustrate the football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Homes generously camped and scattered dead bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture of the title "That is Nigeria '. from the Imgur User Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015. more pictures of the incident form the grey scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows ranks of carbonated body, which are upset on the floor while people see them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story is not its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was plagued by several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, though not to be attributed to the context of the tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On the 3rd of January 2015 the fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the escaped Nigerian village of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Yewitnesses reported drastically the atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were placed in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">The numbers could not be confirmed. "no one remained back to count bodies," said a man on Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite imagery the follow-up time could be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unexplained, but the armed conflict in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt to win the Boko Haram country to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture shows the DR Congo again, as it falsely display as proof of the fact and the possible level of attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of errors; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the image was presented as a proof for mass strikes.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further, such as this example, falsely display the picture from DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture of Sange also occurred in association with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations, those who could flee the strokes, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following on which these descriptions were merged with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page, which claimed in 2012, the president Myanmars Than has said that monks and politician allegedly participated in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she used the image from DR Congo to view this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was adopted last on 26 April 2017, can be called here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organisations, who called AFP as their source, were also falsely attributed to Than His saying, but had not taken the picture from the DR Congo in connection.</seg>
<seg id="859">The global reach of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false decoupling spanning up to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "reverse picture search," you can see how far information limits can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">A reverse picture-search with the search engine TinEye has found out of 18.8 billion images (as of May 3, 2017) 344 images that are very similar to the stated picture from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a medley of private parties, platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as: English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have been forwarded to false reports, some have tried to unmask the forgeries.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have identified examples of the misuse utilisation and associated with the respective countries in connection, based on what page they had been published. by this way, we want to display the range more evident than by language only.</seg>
<seg id="866">Several examples of uncommon use can be derived from the listed lands (which in some cases were also linked together).</seg>
<seg id="867">Here are some instances that can now be felt completely (on the map in orange):</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Than was claimed in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killings of the Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of publication, the picture will continue to include.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article by 2014 on students who had been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the Catholic site Análisis Digital, expressly stated that the picture was not stems from killing, but it claims it's a "similar dzhasty attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture later turned into circulation with the Boko Haram massacre of 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to reimpose that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyordyaUyuy" (Nigeria burns, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo dipped, marked with this Twitterhashtag, and dissolved a discussion among Muslims after the Boko Haram 2015 massacre and to Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities did those events that took possession of Islams in the name of Islam, a greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was disguised as proof of the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9.300 times). but the messages related to them were taken in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to attract attention to the relative numbers of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (ese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message which allegedly has been written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" on the Nigerian massacre in circulation, it was translated into circulation, such as this here in Vietnamese and declared it to falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message where the picture was contained in the DR Congo, the organisation of the Claretrist Missionaries and Pater Juan Carlos Martos distanced themselves.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of a faultless use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">In other accounts, aggregates and pages in the following countries (on the portfolio in grey), Tinder are also back, but are no longer traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time-timestamp do not exist on the web crawler and to gather information about educational names in the context of Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared until the original accident in 2010, the picture may ultimately be a correct description but the original fee is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (frames) that this posts pass through. the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of major discussions regarding the silence of Christians through Muslims or in the defence of Muslims - the murdered victims of the Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued at a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion are wanting to understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth to investigate how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give this pictures longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are ety people who have unintentionally part of drinking the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugars this mood of mis- and falcons, that actual atrocities are intrue and removes the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and Myanmar in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that it returns to a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even asked by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, concern that violent images readers and viewer learners and give them the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, investigating how violent media act to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are some regarding violent representations in the news media, the fact that it is essential for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists have experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." you will have to think about the situation in which a picture suggests, which is actually replaced by the context or on completely misusing species.</seg>
<seg id="940">Every investigation of false assignments should also be considered as internationally they can be internationally.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo of Andy Simmons was used according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untransceivable (e.g. Ded. untranslated), language enthused to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in each language: you press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these intranslated words are already well known (as the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others that are rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish sodomesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression does not suffices, which is why a full explanation, and sometimes somewhat context necessary to understand what is meant by this word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a period of time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists include Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on little different languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In Blog one finds the example words from Vanuatu's language, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vacasteglok" - draw your parents in recognition of how you strive for your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">Words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the convenience or sloth you feel after being warmed for cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's words from his blog above:</seg>
<seg id="956">They smuters other cultures, reveal other ideas and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you affect how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this page, even more of these "unacceptable words, and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages," which are very appreciated by Untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="969">How Sri Lanka joins the worst flood catastrophe of the decade</seg>
<seg id="970">The island nation of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flooding and flood catastrophe in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon that coincides in late May, by strong rainfall, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya entered the south and west of the country over the banks.</seg>
<seg id="972">Following a statement from the disaster of Sri Lanka from May 28, 2017, 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missed because of the floods and slimes.</seg>
<seg id="973">Over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday (May 26) and roughly 100 000 people were brought into 304 safe residence.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfall followed on Saturday (May 27) and the water stocks in some areas went slowly.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene changes in the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still unapproachable areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the amount of the flood catastrophe:</seg>
<seg id="977">High tide at the Tawalama town with water walls of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users such as Azzam ants and Sri Lanka provide regular updates to the flood situation.</seg>
<seg id="978">Many use the hashtag # FloodSL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="979">Sri Lanka's deadly floods hammered the denial crisis, save the Children, after further rainfalls are already on the way.</seg>
<seg id="980">This morning the Neluwa Bus rose up to 6 meters. village Moragoda at Galle also flooded through the water pegels of Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The Air Force has made five planes for rescue actions and another five will be made for transportation of emergency supplies for the residents in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organisations and startups have also declared themselves to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages such as Help Flood VICTIMS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information on high-water conditions and humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you need some search and rescue teams for their operations, please call number 0774844639.</seg>

<seg id="987">Please call number 0777449729 or 0777843841 where animals need help in this field.</seg>
<seg id="988">The Taxiruf-App picks (Sri Lanka) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app so that the catastophcenter will be informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the Tropical tower Roanu, picks brought me a "high-water aid" button, which allowed users to call a vehicle to pickup help from help and donations. they were then forwarded to the srilous Red Cross.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also led a "SOS" key, which included more than thousands of enquiries and 150 successful boaters for water and heating systems.</seg>
<seg id="991">The united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka, where several social media platforms are fully trained, bring residents in need of safety and afford assistance in safety.</seg>
<seg id="992">This has prevented the loss of other human lives, the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normality.</seg>

<seg id="996">We approved the use of the Women's March in January when I participated in the Women's March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend.</seg>
<seg id="997">I trust her four years old daughter, she confided to me her children; she is my rock in the fire.</seg>
<seg id="998">In the one minute we call for the rights of women.</seg>
<seg id="999">In the next, we have rights for transgenders.</seg>
<seg id="1000">We are located in a sea of umbrellas and people, some keep the iconic picture of a woman with headscarf high, bound from a American flag, other channels against Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="1001">My girlfriend looks at me and says: "these things aren't related to you, isn't it?" why, because I am not Muslim?, "I wonder.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I have already taken this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People who have been working or people who have been working for me for years, separate me - the Sahar that they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims," which has built themselves in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They suspend me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practiced our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, on different species but somehow we are all put in the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is designed very well in our collective performance that as Muslims, as I do not fit there, become invalid there.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Demuslization become mixed</seg>
<seg id="1011">I don't stand alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This is even a poet that poetry is best selling in America: Rumi.</seg>
<seg id="1013">Which pictures are coming in a sense when you think of him?</seg>
<seg id="1014">Love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin was so old as I was now, he was a Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died, the centre of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But religion was extinguished in the Western world as well as the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deletion makes a huge part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another has been in the reduced figures of Muslims, which have been colonising Western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This tempting picture language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman who should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The groundbreaking Palestinian American scientist Edward Said had the story behind these pictures in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1023">But these pictures continue to stand out today.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood still steadfast.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I have worked in the news industry for ten years and I saw how this powerful, erroneous narrative will dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative hit the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries in the last three decades, while the United States won't even choose its first female presidential candidacy in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognize that when French, Muslim women are prevented from making their headscarf in public buildings and to cover Saudi-Arab, Muslim women with their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group practiced his "control" on the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong narrowful weakened Muslim women, which lead movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It is evident that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American territory from Africans, who had been brought down here to slave trade.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of Queer-Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This scatative has filled our collective bargaining strength so far and erroneously busy that often Sikh-men and children become the destination of anti-militarious attacks and jackals.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the species we tell them is Islamophobia not only fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">Around 1.7 billion belong</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than just stories based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create folks, who help us understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry is enrichly failed to capture the narrowful of 1.7 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1039">And we have failed here, where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree "religious group in America."</seg>
<seg id="1040">More than one third of the entire Muslim population are African-stocky American.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants from the first generation, coming from 77 countries.</seg>
<seg id="1042">The parents of the author 1976 in New York.</seg>
<seg id="1043">Approves use.</seg>
<seg id="1044">Four decades ago, my parents immigrated to New York to live their American dream.</seg>
<seg id="1045">My mother laid her first spot design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim, American Statiker from Bangladesh with the name Fazlur Rahman Khan.</seg>
<seg id="1046">At that time when Khan had rethinking the Skylines of the world, my parents were mismised Muslims and Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1047">But have I been miserable Muslim and American?</seg>
<seg id="1048">Sometimes, when people ask me why I do not eat pork, I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or carry out my handsome handkerchiefs that all Muslims wear - "from respect to Peppa Wutz."</seg>
<seg id="1049">I jest, we don't wear all handkerchiefs with us.</seg>
<seg id="1050">We also have to be no theological experts to be "Muslim" or almost always to be selected for additional security checks at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="1051">There are hundreds of Muslim scholars, Muslim activists and interreligious activists who strive to fight widespread lies across Islam.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These lies are produced on the current band of a well decorated Islamophobia with money lavers, think tanks and experts for counterfeit information, which is our already erroneous picture of what a Muslim is; or what Islam is, manipulated.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Because of the stories we tell and because of the species we tell them, Islamophobia exists in more than just a foreigner, who tear down the headscarf.</seg>
<seg id="1054">Or as the scary map of attacks on mosques in the whole United States, see below.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Screenshot of ACLU website.</seg>
<seg id="1056">Islamophobia in its ugly forms assesses our belonging.</seg>
<seg id="1057">It attacks our identity, which is so extensive, so versatile and complex that it can fit into a drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The author was in 1986 at a photo of their kindergarten group.</seg>
<seg id="1059">Approves use.</seg>
<seg id="1060">I want to explain this.</seg>
<seg id="1061">I was born as the Muslim, but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old, in a provisorical mosque in the basement of a presbyterian church in New York.</seg>
<seg id="1062">When social scientists describe religious life, they attack the following terms: faith, behavior, and belonging.</seg>
<seg id="1063">My Muslim faith and behaviors are not always visible, but they are there.</seg>
<seg id="1064">Perhaps my girlfriend, my neighbor, my neighbor in the surf see that I am Muslim, when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that could separate our houses.</seg>
<seg id="1065">She would see the omnipresent ritual with my daughter when I kept them in my arms and her the Arabic lines to protect the Koran and called the Qimpulse.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Each of them I repeat three times.</seg>
<seg id="1067">For this reason, I beg you, that it is protected from evil, to evil that one can see and evil that you can't see.</seg>
<seg id="1068">My Muslim faith is not always visible, but my Muslim's belonging is always part of my shadow.</seg>
<seg id="1069">The grandmother of the author, when she wins an icon competition in Karachi, was posing with her sisters sometime in the 1960s.</seg>

<seg id="1071">Belonging is the picture of my grandmother's maternal grandmother with her sisters; how many decades ago they win a competition of the art of floral artists in Karachi.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is the picture of her that I close my eyes: nano, surrounded by their finished and unfinished paintings by the ancient Sufi-Holy; and an Korans with many bookmarks, a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters, which they can be almost inable.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Muslim means to be the prayer which she had said to me, when I have a bad day.</seg>
<seg id="1074">To be the Muslim, as she taught me to refer to God: Allah is what God means, my only Lord.</seg>
<seg id="1075">For a people who has been colonised by a "Empire" by a "Empire," which has founded a company with the name of venerable British East-India company, it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The author in 1987 with her grandfather.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Approves use.</seg>
<seg id="1078">Belonging means to grow and listen, that men don't cry, but at the same time that my grandfather is crying.</seg>
<seg id="1079">Meanwhile, while he writes books on the modern Islam and beyond the independence of Kashmir, Nana Jaan has failed to confuse his family in India, family, that he did not close into his arms in half a century.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Belonging is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians who, as with my grandfather, were torn apart by colonists, who have shared the Muslim world as at stake.</seg>
<seg id="1081">For the past two centuries, Muslim means that all to four Muslim countries have been colonised "by four Muslim nations.</seg>
<seg id="1082">It means that the first flight genombe of history was thrown off in a century over a Muslim country.</seg>
<seg id="1083">It means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother, an Indian, kashmir of British Empire, was called "dangerous" by the newspapers of his time as "dangerous," as he was the first mosque in England.</seg>
<seg id="1084">Even before there were planes, he travelled to more parts of the world when I was ever and preaching the radical word of love, peace and social justice.</seg>

<seg id="1088">In addition to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion, we are deeply moved into our unforgettable family trees; our uninterconnected history.</seg>
<seg id="1089">It means that two years ago, the most powerful military in the world, with troops that were distributed over every continent, apart from Antarctica, has gone into Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1090">It means that more than half a million Iraqis buried under the rubble of the war.</seg>
<seg id="1091">An American Muslim is to know that the suicide rate among veterans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001.</seg>
<seg id="1092">It means to know that when a tragedy is home to the USA, suspects a Muslim name, the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assassin.</seg>
<seg id="1093">It means to know that four hundred years ago, the first prayer call, the Azaan, was called Bilal by a freed black slaves.</seg>
<seg id="1094">It means that two hundred years ago, an African Islamist called Bilali Muhammad was enslaved and brought into this country.</seg>
<seg id="1095">It means Malcolm X call an American hero.</seg>
<seg id="1096">It is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban.</seg>
<seg id="1097">It is hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life.</seg>
<seg id="1098">An American woman, a Pakistanerin, a Pahari, a Pahari, a Muslim, a Muslim, a Muslim, a Muslim and a journalist, previewed the inherent intersectionality of our conjunctivities, but to fail to communicate them on others.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The Narrative of the 1.7 billion birders features more possibilities than a magic cubes, but is represented in the reduced tweness, "we" against "it."</seg>
<seg id="1100">To be a mother, to take care of my child, and to make all Muslim children, knowing that powerful and privileged people to establish structural Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="1101">Structural Islamophobia consists in the Muslim manifestations that began with President Bush and have been expanded to President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="1102">It consists of continuous monitoring of mosques.</seg>
<seg id="1103">It exists in the immigration liaison officer, who takes a five-year-old child in handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It exists in a country that excludes its borders from people from just countries, which bombed it.</seg>
<seg id="1105">It is a false and nebulous "No-Fly list," which takes largely Arabs and Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1106">These are the wars we lead and the bombs that we toss on Muslim lands.</seg>
<seg id="1107">Because of the stories we tell and because of those who do not tell us, we are here today.</seg>
<seg id="1108">In a study entitled Ascent of Man, scientists of the Northwestern University participants showed a scientific picture and desired them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding the evolution of evolution.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Muslims received the lowest point.</seg>
<seg id="1110">The conversation we need to lead</seg>
<seg id="1111">We are too deeply daring to reveal Muslim, Muslim, or the other "others."</seg>
<seg id="1112">We stand back decades, the roots of our fears, and the erroneous and dangerous-visual expression we present in our news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="1113">At least there is a growing movement, led by American Muslims within the media industry, trying to capture our multiple with dash-looking identities and forgotten history.</seg>
<seg id="1114">The podcast Lake Something, Say of Buzzard; the podcast # GoodMuslim Bada; the virgist Salam Reads, an initiative, increased Muslim authors and Ms Marvel, the Pakistani, Muslim, American Superheldin - all this makes me hope.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Screenshots of media initiatives, which want to show the complexity and intersectionality of Muslim American life.</seg>
<seg id="1116">Collage by the author.</seg>
<seg id="1117">But I am concerned with this difficult global time point, in which we are located.</seg>
<seg id="1118">And that moment has consequences, which go out over 1.7 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="1119">There is a reason that conspirationist theorist existed in the dark corners of the Internet, now the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1120">They are exponentially grown, because they have made Muslims to "others."</seg>
<seg id="1121">There is another group that has grown exponentially by having created the "other".</seg>
<seg id="1122">A few years before, it had not been given them; now, there are large areas in Syria and Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="1123">I am concerned about the realities and history, which I was not aware of me when I was so old now, as I was now my daughter, but who made me today an invaluable Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Things I have left here like a breadcrumb track in my speech.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Things that are perhaps awaken, because in all the intersections that our humanity might make, a story is lurking, where somebody is made to a "others."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Right now, on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley, conversations are held within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference to Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="1127">More than a hundred academics talk about our problems with the "other," structural racism and "American militarism."</seg>

<seg id="1129">Poster of the facebookside of the Islamophobia Studies Network.</seg>
<seg id="1130">We all need to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why don't I tell it here at this TEDx talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who has shown us how wars are led and people through the monkeys of "other" in public presentation, four decades ago had been Scientific of Stanford.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of him, consciously, and unconscious of the "other" on the role, as it was able to introduce ourselves to a new future in which we have no presidents, while he has already bombed countries and "to other geared" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an opportunity to enter here in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the count of stories in their original language is a possible response to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported about an alternative text by Steven Bird, the intranslated blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS does not lie on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain the linguistic diversity of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Oakland, in the United States, where TLS has existed since 2015, the risk that small and not quite small languages can not be handed over to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">Mass mortality of the world may be avoided, when we create cities that require diversity - safe rooms in which residents don't have to forget who they are in order to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While listening is often associated with it, to understand "beating these events instead" the listening to appreciate, "follow" instead. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers provide their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are no professional storytellers, their devotion and their presentation make sure that the audiences are included.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They cry out laughing and emotions, then the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou also takes the opportunity to explain the narrative of the narrative of the narrative.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the fuss from the rabbit and the Pavian language in Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the importance of his frank, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is that to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he divides his feel of exclusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">To date, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. everyone who inspired by the project can be found in contact with TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for the USA revocation of the sovereign debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a retrial of the Public Debt of Puerto Rico, which amount to 72 million US dollars on April 3, 2017, several religious and bourgeois organizations participated in a mass demonstration; the march started at the puberian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (civil front for the neural examination) and the National Assembly of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocate of the refestation of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ros demanded that politicians, banks and government agencies, responsible for the debts, are responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We demand a financial audit and a Steering Committee without personal interests in public debts, with a firm, to our working conditions, the compensation in favour of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressurized and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Ros refuses to pay a debt that is not her.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">The pensioners will not be able to find out with decreasing pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We require immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not within the territory of the United States - is suffering from the United States - suffers from a heavy financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Hence the so-called "Centre for New Economic," a non-governmental non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on socio-economic development, a law for state responsibility, as an alternative to existing state supervision.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">From outside imposed measures, without the participation and conviction of citizens, are risk to be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration was the name of "night watch for light and truth."</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian webdeveloper Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, supporters and members put the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which will be aligned in Berlin, dedicated himself to an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Ruhling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inner (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published in the last year and is not available here, contains a number of articles that are dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements are assembled for free knowledge and what the true costs are linked to which this is linked.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in the movements of free knowledge, have been working on page to view over the fog, which gives our newsfeeds and create something of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free basel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the Adra prison directory, in which he was sitting on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title of collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in free culture, many of us will begin to think about their own fate, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of time extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer of Open Source and digital activity has been held in the Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military service to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the "military police bases had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military tribunal of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, that they themselves acted as the insider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place and condition continues to remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer in Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role to expand access to internet and knowledge of the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologian and at the moment the ladder of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of bassels's cultural prototypes are more provocable than the work that he started reconstructive with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists to virtually design the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the difference of numerous civilizations and merging Greek-Roman architectural models with hitherto traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would put all that architecture which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This shift in digital archaeology and preservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not close this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life in order to dream of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned English to read, write and talk.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always shared his knowledge with each other who asked. he taught me to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opens the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught others those who use computers, at least theoretically, without the fact that they actually made one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a certificate that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was detained in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together for a year together on the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She garnished the lyrics when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is licensed free.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It is happening."</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens in every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That, in the moment, I lose the truth in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That every one of the dangers is no matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prison quarters of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I was in every detail of thy voice and words;</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I carry with passion for me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes may say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I quickly return to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To get all the moments back,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And over your absence to weep and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify to myself, that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the detention of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year goes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">While, during</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bassel's story is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the protests in 2011 against the regime's Bashar al-Assad's regime, more than 65.000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime, tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: owing to corruption and sentenced to pre-release taxes on pretending post</seg>
<seg id="1255">The Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption that returned to the workplace after the half of his sentence to the workplace in the state machine, where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the result of Diodine Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison on four other defendants with four other defendants in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose Council was Chief Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his re-setting to the company, what happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, that prohibits the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza, again to refer to its old position as the company had not completed its confinement.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents don't mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre of Public Integrity (Centro de Integrridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the decision of the company to make the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">A setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to acknowledge, that the company should also have a disciplinarian procedure against the contradictions.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company appears, however, and illustrate no appropriate legal steps for the application of the relevant functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a major voice in the Mozambique social media, rejects this behaviour as well as "contradicted":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, it would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of which has been given.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paid speeches and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is competent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company that he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambience and student of political science in Brazil, says the director of no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state, because he insulting him, I can't believe anybody would be rewarded with such a massive rise.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morality and to serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has instead served himself to the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as handy to have an inexhaustible financial source and the state itself became tired of that man, who was invited and finally sentenced to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remember the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief is in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves are part of the Samora Machel prison will not only be remembered as the first independent President in memory but also as a sharp, single-cutting and - by way - prophetically Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, it was an energetically confirmed that "an ambitious human being is capable of selling its own individual interest in its ambitions."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said, "I don't know if a ambitious person is changing, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not withdraw from its ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious human being is a criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also rejected:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment, he was 10 years old and he was free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today, the company, in which he inherited the validity of money, is again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - the αB _ Rafik on May 12, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users to wrong</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burial word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or spell.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network made their minds from the net because they abstained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of Eastern indigenous origin, or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook equipates the word "Kalar" or by taking them (in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the ascension has given radical nationalistic movements to the word an extremely sevenous connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by ultra-nationalists than hate crimes against Muslims, which constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word in itself does not appear automatically based on them.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that too, in which they have discussed the use of the word, or have expressed doubt two of its use to be censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore there are several burial words with basic meanings that have the same book sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair at Burmese also wrote 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(bubble),' Kalar Oat '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookout Aung Kaung Myat declared the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was extinguished today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on spiritually asked whether they could relieve his back pain by using a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The ku of ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hung is the opinion that they should reduce hate language radical nationalists, but also emphasized that Facebook analysts ought to be analytic before it extinguishes all the trusts that is suspected to spread racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you write to Faceliac.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What to do instead, is carefully analysing the post and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For instance, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (bubble bath).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three nationalistic nationalists, the hate language spreading, get a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action is a strong signal to all send them, hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy does not long to stop.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of percepts often have a catch- and mouse game, whereby the user social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative write-wise of the censored word to express its views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author of Aung Kaung myat described how Facebook started to delete its posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new guideline of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically my post was removed from Facebook and I was told the liken, post and sharing of contents for 24 hours, because the Post will not defile the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts away from people who have no negative intentions, or the simply try to demonstrate their opinions against them to radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his postal mail has been removed, which has nothing to do with hate language:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post-free speech from Facebook is removed.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In Post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism are badly in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine thinks that Facebook would have to do more than the beginning of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet Community asks for Council:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook might have a benevolent intention of reducing racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">To grant such words, only more hatred will bring in the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have all started without local context or technical support and so words such as "chair" or "Insencurry" are forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they were not trying to correct the falsified Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a large turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks is automatic censorship for a lot of spending by users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make funny and write about the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their hosts will be taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts which contained no hate language, but nevertheless they were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and see an inheritance curry and see a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post-states "If you're a doctor, do you cure people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious Fundamentalists, social networks have also used to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate language should also heating the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to bring out the wuappy hate to his burial sites, criticised.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of atting the word 'Kalar', it might have been better running in context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>
<seg id="1340">In Trinidad & # 038; Tobago has concluded with the child before</seg>
<seg id="1341">A wedding ring in sand.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the country's parliament unanimously decided to negotiate a law which should offer this practice, so that the full age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">In front of this change, some members of dualistic and Muslim religious groups took part in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersiad Maharaj joined the country's religious groups (IRO), a group who would not interfere with representatives of the various religious groups in the country, as the state was not the maturity of maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This was irrelevant to the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has defined a contract partner of the UN child prevention, the minors of people under 18 years of age. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15, Trinidad and Tobago amounted to 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical centre of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married among 19 boys.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which were anxious to abolish laws on childbefore, followed by the foot and rejoiced their support. undoubtedly, they helped bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to say the critics of the children before, they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition provided stress in this actually uncomplicated matter, and sometime later, doubts were on whether the Opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's case - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, that he abstained in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must be united and proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators wanted a status update on Facebook which has regained Leslie-Ann Boiselle at Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of the children before the House of Representatives was sentenced to 35 votes in the House of Representatives, and there was no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After first decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws finally had changed to children before.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who was a prime minister in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took all too much time and unnecessary suede, which has lost the core of the matter, but do you know what? the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson, the opinion was that it would definitely take long enough to do the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook of Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The spouse has been decided.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Congratulations. congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Thanks to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But there is a possible hook in the form of Satellite Maharaj, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Prior to months, Maharaj has announced his intention to take court steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law said it was quite legitimately, if Maharaj was thinking against the law, most social media users wanted to make the debate different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested that:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Mary, if we say, instead of discussing the discussion as general, in a way that we invite only panic and wormwood if we would like to talk about the problem that it may be abused by large, hard-minded men who are contrary to them, "would you be ready to proceed discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial verge against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children before in different gradations are legal or still the norm, even though there are laws that they should undergo.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Hackers broke the Office of the State of State in the nationwide protests at the Russian national day</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, compared to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month, Turkey closed the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day, more important, how important is the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and fans of TV series fight against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technology experienced Internet users are used to use envelopes tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users don't fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey closed articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been taking place since 2007, after the Internet Law (no. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second best known country in the world when it comes to massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to remain locked, several mirrors (pages containing the content of Wikipedia are mirrored and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution was published by IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-Peer network (i.e. computer calculator), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is disable, though, in spite of the laws.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a bloc post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the news (on the plying of Wikipedia), we operating everything to dismantle Snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents to decentralised and distributed fashion.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to look at least all Wikipedia content even if it does not reach the site www.wiktionary.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was run independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is just about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to deal the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia, Italy has both tr.vikiansiestpe.org, a Mirror site of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to show similar Mirror sites when there is Wikipedia closed in the country on Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and staff at Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It's not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One attaches to another URL, which is not the original. that which one looks then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server runs on request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is run by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it better give for a passionate game photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a phone call from my father that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river is just a few minutes from the tourist place Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river, where the leopard was and I immediately began to kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar wants a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal as nature and want to deepen the understanding of the fact that wild animals are not so frightening as they look like.</seg>

<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepals Nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was posted by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many sharing of India, women shall avoid worse care, husbands, husbands, or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her husband's social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should despise the norm in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state of Odisha by an illusionist court and expelled from her family and the village community after having called a given relatives with his name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of wives also does not name in the name, is also common among men. however, they have much less chance to fear if ever, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health personnel, as well as housewives, became a unique club with the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, which they discuss and discuss the fineness of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">One of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal that is operated by the community video Volunteers and set up for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of their videocamera at the discovery of internships, such as kindergarten up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS infected, and runs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports on how these clubs were created a safe place for these women, and they were made simultaneously dealing with ambassadors of the Change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that showed Rohini in their discussion round, acted by women who call their husbands at the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject, because she would open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to address the names of their husbands, an increase is not guilty and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini thinks:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes for a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this, is regarded as a deceitful tongue, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never done thoughts about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini wanted to have never mentioned her husband until now, at home, at home, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother-in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video had ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him by now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started her first conversation with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members were a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">Following the video projection, the women tried to put the discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini begged all participants to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, scandalized, sad, lovingly and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, that they should not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it be equivalent to it? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought their husbands about their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a century-old tradition in which women never married the names of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that, during the whole exercise, she just laughed away, and another decided to leave the frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush to have broken with an ancient bridge, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">They kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Over the next days, Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a wife called Rohini and asked what ideas they put on women in his head, his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law dragged her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of participating in the situation was less understandable and the situation had arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of interest nored point on the forehead, which shows the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the zinnored point if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I listened to it, to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women are not completely stopped, but mean they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, discussion is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip with every Discussion Club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack all lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to worry about women who could hear what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays in their life with cakes; they danced and sang, talking about things about which they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working with these problems since so many years and yet I also have made many things, for example, how our identities are linked to our husbands, never so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have entertain ourselves about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris in their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them is okay, but some wanted to have a saline curta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they have not looked at themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion on the advantages of its own dress code, the morals connected with the Saris and much more, Rohinted Rohini their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so that the women could carry it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan an excursion to Goa, where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure to get it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To question whether in the five months of their first conversation, Rohini confirms that things are slowly entering the reels:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do not make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Just one or two still say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the Discussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the Feiling to achieve more freedom of movement or its own coat-election - at the end of a difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of Patriarchate's patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I also am there.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone a confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, when any woman comes home and other people who talk about what we're talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit down in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers community come from distinct groups in India and make videos about stories that will not be reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">These stories are "messages of those who themselves are experiencing," and offer a hyperlocal context to report about global human rights and development demands.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which probably was recently made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissidents of Liu Xiaobo held attention in international community attention, after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June, that he was hospitalized for cancer of cancer in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years "imprisonment for" Subversion "(State endangering) after he took part in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto which calls for the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has been referred to as "an internal issue" and a spokesman tells about it as "not needed to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nonetheless, China continues to release views from the international community, the Nobel prize laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, release or allow him to allow treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the Paares in Beijing, others have completely out of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press summarized some of the reactions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Pod Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June, to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesman, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to enable Liu in abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's ministerial president Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brending have refused to answer questions about Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into the Stocks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this would eventually have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations was resumed until December last year. however, in June, Norway led an agreement to resume the Lachaise back in China, as the exports since 2010 were mostly blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread, Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release and invited Liu an to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his incarceration, he was unable to increase his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>

<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision to liberate Liu and his wife immediately to liberate the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support, where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomatic mission of the European Union, Federica Mogherini, asked China also for the release of Lius, as she announced in an explanation on 30 June:</seg>

<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP before that Lius Woman, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room at the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone beyond, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to uphold his international human rights reform, including freedom of expression, to uphold the rights of such rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's State Department requested China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments he needs, regardless where, needs. furthermore, his wife and family can have contact with it.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news service France info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France would end it eventually.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the Legislative Assembly in Taiwan took on 27 June to release Liu's release and demand a greater tolerance towards those who require peaceful means to challenge political reform and democratic development.</seg>

<seg id="1678">It is my faith that the initiatives he took and was punished for which he was punished, more stable, more prosperous and prosperous China, which in turn has contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally and encouraged me when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupidly, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the ministers noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party in Singapore, because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice to rotate "the logic," to defend the existing authorized exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country, you hear that we finally don't have any country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the certificate of a escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, then shall it be?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons caused by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to what was able to measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of what, he seemed unsolically undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, or New York, alike cities which are managed by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the main point of the subject, the good old bodies of the authoritarian leaders goes on to give the proposed democrats, leaving logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week the last week of Shanmugam were given answers to his American guests concerning our press, our Judikative, our political system really non-answer.</seg>
<seg id="1703">On these questions, he tried with non-answer rational species.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion, as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, but a city is, what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our werter K shanmugam would take on to clarify this point where he was paid up to be part of the town of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog, he has published his comment on the reviews that you should start to read the whole transcript of the conference to be able to understand the context of Shanmugam, according to those Singapore should be a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">As he said that Singapore was rather a "city" be regarded as a country, "he declared why the elections in Singapore should be so uneasy, even if we are looking forward to and just as a fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He contractually Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">As he said that Singapore was not a country, "he obviously not meant it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows its disappointment of Shanmugam, which makes as leader of a growing generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore did so much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, what I expected - am I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not sure of whether he really believes, properly and aware of what he is defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review demarks the vulnerability of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam have committed a mistake, or was it a freer-author?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country the sovereign rights of the city are going back to Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role in the intergovernmental system, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, they only defend their city?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personal identity?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the residents of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">Well, the magazine Journey of a Decade into the explaining, Singapore is and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have scandalized many of the people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we are often cited as "the defense of the country, especially" etc., but that is not quite right.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather talk about the defense of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1736">The Myth of the "nice Canadian"</seg>
<seg id="1737">The Canadian Ned Flanders.</seg>
<seg id="1738">Screenshot of a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked for short his editors: what is the most misused aspect about your residence or home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world revealed and another facet shall be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series dates from Nevis Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is put to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answer. "I come from Canada." since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation the conversation occurs, it is considered courteous to show interest in his talk partner by presenting personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In my clarification, the default answer is then follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice-hockey, nature." many Canadians may cook carnly before anger when they are kept for Americans but doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag visibly on their backpack if they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">By contrast Americans....</seg>
<seg id="1750">That's how I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - prior to Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried little maple sheets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free healthcare!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There aren't any weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gay marriage have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everybody seems to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously speak very often "sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is reportedly regarded as the tolerant country toward ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadian are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends who I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">There would be nothing to me, when one would switch to Johnny from Dallas, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">Firstly: as "nice" to be called "nice" to be skeely, as the good-minded, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has a double Canadian woman).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would have a nation full of people such as Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem exists that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Be harmless, means inconspicuous and ininteresting to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">That can be something good if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, fernab of the things that happen around one around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go to say that the desire, free and alone, is a major leader of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own matters.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders described as "nice" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not talk about the fence with our neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We are missing the warm hearted, open kindness, which I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau led the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice," our Prime Minister has made Canada right too sexy.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop-band parores Thailands Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">One in Thailand's famous pop-band published a music video that took power by the Junta and re-establish the power in 2014 and reigns in spite of their promises to restore civilian rule.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl), the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told it his girlfriend makes his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video still refers to the continuing military dominance of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet use for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days, this video was shared on Facebook 1.254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The dictator" was blocked in Thailand, after a group of activists overlooked the public to view this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policy, especially as it stands in the situation of the country under the Junta domination.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at the videos of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand were followed in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" may be relying on the draconical section 44 of the preliminary Constitution which gave the commander-in-chief of the army's absolute decision on important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious programme for "installation change" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered a critic of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the implementation of the law relating to computer criminal, whose vague and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to tolerate activists and other critics of the State.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was instituted in the army, the online content monitored and persons accused of having slandered the monarchy, is prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets a strict ban on "Lese Majeste" (marquee insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the war was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta still pursues its decision to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned them that the purchase would be unnecessary and a waste of tax gelding.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black supply chain before being put them into an internship, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists sit in prison, because they allegedly created "confusion" in society and undermined web sentences, they should insult the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the Teaser's songs from the band, who imitated the Salem from "The Tribute of Panem," which had already been used by Putsch opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and KharChilava are situated in the carbon basin of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups like Russians, Greeks, kidnapping and Georgian and Armenians lived and worked in Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today the largest part Russians and chases live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">These settlements are also called vastasia in parchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, there are only a few hundred people living in these vultures.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of 16.000 people had risen once more than a decade.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the path of migrants, cross Europe or Latin America, certain places will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year-old Mexican player, a small woman with a coral pink jacket and golden earrings in teddy bear design.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. however, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, brushing walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Haitian migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment, it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them, and brings them to hospital when they are sick, she purchases them drugs that they can't pay them, they massage them with a balm away from the long journey of tired feet.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived before a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable first name for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurt tubs) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil, hoping to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao is traveling with his sister, hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and her three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans that are on the way to the United States, normally a first stop in South America and then go towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other cats from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel together the route and that the Africans were talking on WhatsApp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil in advance, and worked as a construction worker at the construction of the Olympic Games and the soccer World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mum Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," he answers a smile. "we will always be in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests send their often text messages when they are gone to report them or to report about the course of their trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught them to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark for the migrants who are traveling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, Sackgasse leads to Jesharela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus ticket to be sold to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly sharks.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on the floor, but at least they have electricity, washing machine and a cooking area outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After three years he lived, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his labor station.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to extract money from him without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown, an all-stone, has offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the gears, passengers consult their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large majority of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy about that her house is full but she is also nostalgic for those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">As a proud grandma she blurizes in her album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care that you made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, young and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughed sorrowfully, while she briefly introduces me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats it every time. "you've been gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang people are forced to install a surveillance app for their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Open-point check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the cell phone users in the Tianshan District of the town of Urumqi sent a cell phone in which they initiate the District government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the message, it is said that the app "is to restrict access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities can also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to a exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed the app shortly after they had replaced the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the release of the police report that the app will determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection rating with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking pornographic websites, of online fraud, Trojan and phishing sites to make users attentive, how much time they spend time online and control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">These app using the filters for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">A app with these functions can, of course, be used in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote-state players or even hacker could enable the home network of a person to manipulate or steal.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, forced ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often assign extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet connection circuits.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter based media outlet Images from Mainland China, "photos from a checkpoint, published images from a Checkpoint where police officers indiscriminate the residents, whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinian make sure people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that the people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are found on a Checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use appliances which are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by repaying technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (with the rule of the rule, too. in addition, a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift up a Windows operating system, and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer's hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang computer and cell phones in Xinjiang by electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may possibly have a reaction to the instructions of the city council, to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and associations, including universities and research institutions, are obligated to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, a US Human Rights Organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media storage cards" at the local police register.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and annihilate any "terrorist videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole number of other possible outcomes, including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="1994">This is the first of six reports in the series "sleep or death," where the activist Sarmad Al Jilane tells his experiences in a Syrian prison.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Far away from our blue, virtual world you look on and stellst that you are alone at one place where all the most important has disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Everything has gradually dissolved itself and revealed a truth which is clearly recognisable, both from inside and outside.</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that makes all the glory to their names.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has broken down in a list of feelings and expressions, who do not allow any metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">But when the reality turns you back and behind the scenes, beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes, and the performer - turn the characters in essence of flesh and blood, and everything cries after death.</seg>
<seg id="2000">All doubt release themselves in smoke and you will be aware of your existence, even if Earth are caught up on the axis of the incurable thing. you will become clear that you are caught between the walls, which your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone may build stone.</seg>
<seg id="2001">They have arrested me and my father three times, but that wasn't enough for I "mean" my lesson, "as the boss of the Security Council formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power to prove us by being even the simplest concepts, which we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five young people were torn during a peaceful protests like weeds from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough to make the city the darkness out of the night with "Allahu Akbar" screams.</seg>
<seg id="2005">All the quarters were coveted, only my own.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even if I had no high demands on a town, which until the arteries with state safety-organisms and their accomplices is crammed.</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night, things had a little bit calming after the power supply of the quarter ceased to work.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke the silence by crying out several times, "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice spies through the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later, some of my friends felt brave enough to collect.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Many friends, true friends join me; we united in a magnificent picture that met my expectations and fulfilled all.</seg>
<seg id="2013">In such a moment, you are aware that you are still free the spirit from the lamp, but it is simply not interested in the lift.</seg>
<seg id="2014">I received a call from my father: "get ready to meet us at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can return to your voice after you snatched all the way up to the office of the Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there, as I am now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The Colonel Ghassan starts to speak: "let me hear how you cry" Allahu Akbar "or you are only brave enough to scream when we are not near."</seg>
<seg id="2020">His eyes filled up upon me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and you dream of what to look at me in the eyes and not on the ground!"</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time that I was standing before this building.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Maybe it was in my foolishness, vanity; perhaps in the revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure when I answered, "I had not thought that you have forgotten my voice before yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">And I think I never stopped looking forward to seeing you in your eyes, so why should I do it now? "</seg>
<seg id="2027">It was the shortest conversation that could have such fatale consequences for me, and yet I regret not a word from what I said.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"he puts him in solitary and his father the same with it."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father equals to it."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The smell of this cursed propositions lies me up until today in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">He became a "syndrome," a spiritual torture, which I was suspended for months.</seg>
<seg id="2032">I piercite the farm.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I will leave everything I carry with me.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Then back through the farm and into the second office, which leads through a gear to the single cells.</seg>
<seg id="2035">I wish all the details exactly before I cared for the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise they have given me a bigger cell for me this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share it with just one other prisoner, and may immediately sit down, without waiting for their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">After a few minutes, which felt like a whole life, the civil servants left the cell, and I turned back on an old and tried communication method: with the fist against the wall.</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell-tainer was a "Generally apprentice."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After long hesitation, he replied to me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a highly regarded man-aged man who looks similar to me and called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">In the perfect darkness, there are no striking faces of facial features, and doctors do not exist here; we are all the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to me?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers deny His existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps it was relocated in one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had assures me, they would be happy when I stay.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liar. liar.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would have had a scarecrow in order to distribute all these crows, who laughed on the fruits in the garden of my head.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Far from the distance I can still hear Allahu Akbar "within the distance.</seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be approximately 10 o'clock in the evening; always taking this time the scream, every day.</seg>

<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that black the color of corruption is, until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person: the raad (about: "thunderings," playing on the 13th scure of Koran).</seg>
<seg id="2054">"they are here to be heard."</seg>
<seg id="2055">With this, the secret was canceled: to protect and prevent the state safety against us, they speak in alawite dialect - so they played their denominational repressive map and made the close eye view of their world view.</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a house, here is no country; it is a curse which they call Koexistenz to transform the criminals of her clans into a hero.</seg>

<seg id="2061">I can really no longer tell, when insults and strokes after a friendly conversation become an ordinary communication tool.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how it happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to be accustomed to me or bad to be punished, although I had nothing to earn this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">At punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe, which probably comes from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your Henk appeals to your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure you with him, and you cannot hold your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cry did not help him, so why they expose the pipe by a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first arrest, I asked whether the investigator had worked as a garbage collector, or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables in each other, to present ourselves from their viewpoint, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">In a single hour three of them changed, while I was still in the series.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all the feeling in my body - and also my voice, which I heard to cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker remarked the cooling and found no pleasure in it, so why he's next to an electrically charged rod grip.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity through my whole body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-naked body, which was stretched out on the ground, was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again. let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed away, that came to me like minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib deepens the majority of his time. sometimes he shoots on his canvas, narrow down to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">As soon as you can rely, a cigarette between his fingers, or with nicotine stained lips is to be discovered.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which had belonged to them since 1967; the year where Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family forced to escape from their village in Palestine, where they lived as fellows (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib is a passionate activist who has surrendered to the conservative majority and their obstructing opinions about gender roles, sexuality and free expression of expression through art and rapine.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deal with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian Geographers, he also calls for the core of all the Arab world. all these themes can not only be found in its hometown of Amman, but also in cities who range from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees itself as a person who is not restricted by limits in his mind, and he can also feel the most devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it is not open, it sweeps up against the US foreign policy, a special disagreement.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib illustrates his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to do in martial arts, to do anything with his identity as "Palestinian Geographers of the second generation," he himself describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own life circumstances," emphasizes Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I am a man," while he pour in water dissolved Nesan in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law states that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for doing it with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a senting hot junitag has little to do against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the pieces are lukewarm coffee and the scarce of the Kent-cigarette in the nose becomes first primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the sky, especially if one throws a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it avoids to do basic things - as in public during the Ramadan water - to do not land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry of Jordanian has canceled a gig of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary committees supporting the Islamic Emirate of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontman Hamed Sinno, has resisted the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert table.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The Euro MP and former press conference in the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the visionist.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim also, the dedication of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which inquire of the well-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continues to apply for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be simply a rhetoric, but actually a clear signal-crystallized reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in Hdaibs plant.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib made traditional sex norms to abolish his vision from the fate of Arab women, who have vorejuvenate sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a clearly burnt unknown woman whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who they actually need to trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past years, the number of 'Ehrenmorde' has risen in Jordan - the unofficial position left in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch: according to Human Rights Watch the number of Honorary Union reached its zenith in 2016; however, the institutional infrastructure is still missing to support the women who tried to support murder or domestic violence to the appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on breaking control from 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of infamilial violence, "and for their release, often a year-long bureaucratic effort and the guarantee by the family is needed that the woman will have nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music also enjoys great popularity and is known to reverence even ahead of topics that are long as taboos in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, recognizes that he is his music that is full of explicit attempts of sexuality, freedom and opinion of expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">He became a proveraged policy, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa 'ed, Hdaib takes the question about the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are politically politically, can continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeatedly mentioned:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words "that one wants" - whether faith or not believe, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that barely any man speaks about the rights of gay and lesbian, and that comments on gender equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular Jordanian Onlineprogram Roya, in order to memorize his comments from the context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without incisions, but was only a revised version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib tranquires the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals did not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nudes, a poet of the eighth century, who still has remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nui had to work once on behalf of the caliph, in the eighth century openly concerning homosexuality, why can Jordanians do not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, such as Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom it is nothing new that the government has sanctioned attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive vote will be put into silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service ordered several former government officials and members of the teaching association, with the grounds that they have expressed himself critical to the problems confronted by the deep in the country with the deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the show Hdaibs, according to this, is only the peak of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant glow and take up. Jordan has shifted an appearance for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - such as Hdaib - is made of slow, reasoned and inner changes. he is sure that these changes are taking place at the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, also from a Arab world without interventions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He is not only dreaming of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem, and Damascus, but also to experience them. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is inspired by music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial kind of democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is done, Hdaib is going to pass on, and it will also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was facilitated by the Pulitzer's Center on Crisis Reporting, where Aman was a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">This great, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories as regards the origin of the Nebuta.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is presumed that there is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas too. a further theory states that the drums, the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have come, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emishi, to force the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how large those parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nonetheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival will take the only True - and spending an amazing way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18-metre-high tower was unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this story, because they help to stop the Peruvian youth from criminality and promote a legitimate profession like the hair of Friseurs.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus's most important port, is located at the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where roadblocks and illegal drug dealers are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region is not safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, visual appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the fact that more normal citizens can relocate in the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos" which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts meeting each other to show who can create from them the eccentric fans, as you can see in the following video (more videos to current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Education institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to run their weapons against hairdressing tools and, instead of bad advice to obtain training in hairdresser, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and offering possibilities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops in March, reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialist school in the community and the district, which we are very proud of, because of the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photograph: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the book "Liebesmessage to guerrilla fighters," which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel cast out to meet affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Just this question was the two young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Carta por la Reconciliación (letters to reconcile) that young people encourages to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country scene was a historical event and they wanted to contribute its part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement (German: revolutionary forces), which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International for the signatories of the peace agreement as such, the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombian, however, there is still a long way to talk about one real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived for many years in illegal camps, exposed to a rhetoric of war and carried out around the clock in order to integrate their weapons in the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn used to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred for guerrilla fighters, must now record them into their ranks and support them in the building of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombia will join together and to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: so far, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters, who are to be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureate, which was held in February 2017 in Bogotá. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we love the people who love we to write on the Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but those who need it much unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he talked about to share his love with people this year, most of the most urgent matters needed.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which now will have to build their place in society and to create a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make the discourse of a warstory of a common history of peace." they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2,000 letters were collected in the context of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would be forgiven me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city management of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogotart traveled into the camp to transfer the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were up as they had done before to counteract the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of support from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all those involved. "it is amazing how many different feelings are going through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the political science student Manuela Jiminez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governors of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">Having passed the letters, a former fighter was introduced by the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because next to him there was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the thorn.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" Oh what are they doing? "he said," I reply to a letter I wrote to me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It 'a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something like a beautiful one, therefore I answer. "then I suddenly set up tears on the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him, and set me beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for war, it was sorry to be all the years of loyal companions to be this fighting, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life as a war. the FARC was to lock him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought someone would be forgiven me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned how to handle arms.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace is prevailing, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the first time, students and leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all growing up as already war and the FARC already existed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insights into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how the social injustice worked on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this magnitude it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear those people who have never found hearing, and to know that the people, which I often seen as monsters, and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings, who were turned around through their lives and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - even those who have been killed and caused much harm to give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp at Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Column bians has been noted that, after deprivation, peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are ready to protest at the weapons, to protest against their rights and to protest against their rights. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">We see from the FARC now to peace, to a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they listen - about all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our Word, make our contribution, and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. among us who defend life as foundation of existence, many difficulties will be coming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexuals and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a large range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and compressors.</seg>
<seg id="2244">With terrors, activists have experienced the reporting of the last months about the gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat, which is like a Damo clan worth over the present LGBTQ community, is not only formed by night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and spoke with us about what is happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has won the international headlines in several months after reports published in the Republic of thematment, torture and killing of queens in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaja Gaseta, and she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities, who arrested certain queens and arrested them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transaction, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Even since their childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she was raised, her became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group had experienced Chechens from the gender equality of their land woman, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">She was afraid of her life in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer aid in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a transaction that was stuck in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I did not hesitate to delay her.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I was trying to help her, someone who thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere in the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of mine. he lost her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya that could remove these disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents went on through on WhatsApp's round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing just taking a few shopping bags from the backseat of my car, I heard a male voice: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt me nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on Chechen: "how long will you still honour the family, you shout?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I don't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and awoke the last final in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had to participate and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two problems in my right lung condition.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office door, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful for him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats to last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, alienation, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The demanded of sending me to Chechnya to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd claims: some said to me, I had to prove that I would run up without through the streets; others wanted me to stand up in the official television in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was only evil, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have KörbchenSize C - what would I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this print?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the whole republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you're a religious wife, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much, and she lay down a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to switch to the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and just a few hours later, under the window, a car with a darkened window plate and a number plate with a 95 on top.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it was the third time, it was clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human right friends revoked the numbering plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give their names, but I will say that I remember them all, they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something strange happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without record, without ID, without paying anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw her into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and check into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe that you would be security, only because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know, in which hotel you steckers. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove you: it's the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still stand in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, this is a table theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still bear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish it, I can't overcome this seelan barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I give it hard to look like the person you remember from their past - so remember my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed for?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the reason I needed some current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who spent one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan they were arrested and tortured, however, that all the end of the Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely, they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">Thus, I mean, they probably charge the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" experienced by blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there even gay men detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine said, there's just not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives, or those of their relatives have been dropped to face the Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are recorded there to present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">You understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not just disappeared, they are targeted specifically to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that only a miming or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I'm just someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison, after growing beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was involved as these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports until now. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why should I not allow these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who are called "non-traditional" orientations have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already familiar to the whole of Grozny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was true, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia was originally intended to lead us to the "Civilization," ultimately, ultimately, in the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were stained; I had coloured eyelashes, bore a tube and a short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security department of the Scharia has never cleaned me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Save not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children, when they make merry.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut up their eyes in front of you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never chased and never smitten me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long kept this mercy time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had landed and laughed before, viewed it once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">During the time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily decreases.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waiter.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I still worked as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At the moment, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I comment with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize teacffs, pastors, I am engaged to hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not leave a cents.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves, when I found a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear an Fiji?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So, nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That's exactly the same as Chechens who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth, that there is no coils in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have what the Cabardiner have, the Russians also have what; on the whole planet it is - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - Muslim Muslims who walk to the mosque and while the Ramadan fasten - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think of transiveness of men who love men, and they think that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a trusteer.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of emotion to be precise, different living settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am right now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahmad Arab community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahmad region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arabic population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahmad Arab.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use of permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 came to the desperate situation of the Arab Ahmad community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child. he lived in Al-Thawra in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and ashamed of his own helplessness that could rise inability to his family, such as Ahmad human rights groups that would stay in Ahmad and anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube was holding the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the Talegra hospital in the city of Ahmadz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arabian Ahmad minority, and activists in the place warned that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahmad Centre for Human Rights announced that this month, some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayyed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have hung.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who felt infloated because of persecution from the Iranian government, helpless, and incapable to feed their families and pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahmad people suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large majority of the Arab people living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to dispute its living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In front of a century, the Arab Ahmadz was an autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and had assumed great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In Ahmad region, there are some of the largest in the oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy is still developing only slowly, and the native population receives only little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illness, hunger and dehydration.</seg>
<seg id="2416">Iranian regime has denied the Iranian regime systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a number of dams, the waters of the Arabic areas in the Persian fields, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have led to destroy devastation in the region caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the local and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-youth now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian director of cooperation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahmad who are looking for a job, completed 55% a secondary school and took 45% a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy" aimed to destroy the spirit of national resistance "</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahmad human rights activist, with residence in London, declared Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of poverty, unemployment and racist ethnical discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "in the number of suicide among the young Ahmad people.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly unemployment has become worse in particular. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic people and a anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not preferred Arabic labour, the local Arab Ahwazi will deduct access to working opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance young Arabs and force them to earn their lives outside their homeland of Ahmad.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their predisposition and surname to hide their belonging to the Ahmad people, as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, softer than speaking of the Arabic language or the dreams of Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances which the Arab Jamahizi must endure, human rights activists strike the alarm before the situation will be explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, whether the world is waking up and its knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why not unify me with the feminism, even with the intersectional did not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is an revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zurichas and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who describe themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustrations.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put out scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money despite the same education as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to making what they are allowed to do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women come before or later in various fields of life to a glacne ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender are still across the many different countries and creations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I'm a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I have to talk about skin color, racism, to black women in the LGBT community or in black women from the Diaspora; if I consider which type we have been physically, mentally and verbally, many white feminists were able to remain silent and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift their voices, and" Kumbaya, "to sing" to sing "to the equality of equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualized violence, we are subject to sexualised violence in addition to women who are subject to double-fold nature.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women of other ethnicities and highways deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school as white girl, due to apparent integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spouses and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want all the women, all men and all men always have any skin color; on the other hand, I can't connect to the black woman in whose center is the white woman who refuses to consider unexpectation in their thinking, referring to sex as well as to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and won't be struggling to fight my belonging to a white-feminist cohous woman who always rejected me and countless other black women and always rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In their speech in 1851, Sojourner ordered 1851 in their speech: "am I no women?" and also I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a deserted and marginal entity.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join the groups that also absorb our customs and customs, to advance our customs and customs surrounding their egocentralized program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to commit white women about the importance of skin color and gender. because some of them continue to keep the meaning of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to revive them.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women different approach to a home and rendering the White feminism, the word "Feminism" is still in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of myself full and entirely of feminism and called me the motion of Womanism instead of using me for a white feminist paradigm, which is so stubbornly that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever, that we define black women with our own ideas and give us into the spheres that are created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can defend ourselves) by means that we are able to defend ourselves with our own fashion, in which they may be completely securely and in which the mental, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion, after they read these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I'm recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life is neither manned, nor ignored, nor is denied.</seg>

<seg id="2467">Todd's contribution to Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine published in particular by international efforts to solve environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="2468">In the context of a content-sharing agreement, this article will be published again.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The Nabil Musa went back over the last 7 years - mostly with surf board or in the canoe - with a special request by the Kurdistan region in Iraq. its mission aims to deliberately make people conscious of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explained us its relationship to the rivers of the region and the effects of pollution on its church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was a child," Musa tells.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organisation of Waterkeepers, a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance, which is committed to protect the rivers, streams, and water ways in Iraq, as well as supporting the local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa summarizes the importance and importance of his work in a question: "if we don't have any water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq-based documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The focus of their work is followed, little remarkable subcultures and characterized by using cooperative video photography and new multimedia techniques, with their help of suppressed municipalities which can tell their stories in their way.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and revised version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" of Currals. the article is one of the series # PorSerMujer (# Refnginity), which report about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez, that she didn't have anything against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had become violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship, some time passed and the police said that their testimony would be laid down to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena was impaired because of abuse, the Ada Báez showed nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women are reimbursed at all, they are generally not receiving support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women also financially depend on the men who abuse it. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence in general in case of law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Indurable strokes and Statist2 Invisible abuses and a legal system that has nothing-ordinated 3 of Gross' 's laws: good approach, defective implementation of strokes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are real manageable, says Myrian González, researcher for gender research on Centro de Documentación y Ems, a social research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports that show but not even ansatin to demonstrate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">But the figures available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney General amounted to 9600 ads for domestic violence. 70% of them went violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads added by the police.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence at the peace of peace. here, 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the indications 40% of women, that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">This statistics, however, does not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to information provided by the paraguayan female Secretary Ana Baiardi only few of those offences are actually shown. "on every woman who refunded in Paraguay because of mental abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">For any woman who was reimbursed for physical abuse, two women who do not do this, "stated at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay is not a crime-continuance, prosecutions are not reasonably documented, as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In August alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to its estimates, in Paraguay all ten days a woman is due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible missions and a legal system that takes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was given the strong friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that they named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then she was after you.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would have become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read earlier this, I always thought that only women are going to submiserable, because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship, and told how he isolated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked diarrhoea, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave it before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuses at least had some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner had mangled her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimony of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with mental failure.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads with the authorities remain without Result and also from its relatives, she has no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against her former partner who developed to become an indescribable legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country, where it mainly went to money, power, and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay's laws: good approach, poor implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not being applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The adabuses is a way full of resistances and a struggle against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems with the use of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016 in the paraguayan Parliament, the bill was discussed under the hashtag # Porte (# Fürth).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# Nonnatives) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law appears to explain Femizidal's original offences and harder to punish as it is the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the text of law has changed in some points to also win the MPs for the law that fear the way for decriminalisation of abortions which currently has been banned in Paraguay and is sentenced to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill intended to cost the bulk of the (bureaucratic and economic) travel costs which have to present the victims of violence even if they simply refresume and obtain safe accommodation in the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective, if the legislature does not have sufficient financial resources available to it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of human relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, one must take place, so violence is not considered a little more normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who are silent in view of these facts, wears themselves and contributes to the perpetrator of the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to refund so long ad, no longer apply to abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Law was adopted in the paraguayischen Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed, but amongst others a passage was deleted, which called the partners in cases of domestic violence on reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for aggressor to attack his victims.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," "political violence" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law is considered to be a great blow.</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the abbreviated and revised version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" of Currals. the article is one of the series # PorSerMujer (# Refnginity), which report about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2545">Independent media in Oman one year after ban a newspaper continue to attacks assault</seg>
<seg id="2546">"this website was locked because of a decision of the information Minister" on the homepage of the banned paper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the omanic authorities closed the independent Arabian newspaper Azamn because of its coverage of corruption in the Sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison where he served a year-in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari, and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried by court but later released free.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn 'since 1970 who came to power after he had set up his father, Saïus Taimur, by heads of state.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the main offices in the country: Prime Minister, Defence Minister, Upper-Chief of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterized by the insidious efforts of security forces, particularly domestic freedom, including press freedom, including freedom of press, independent journalists, blogger and other activists in order to intimidate and incarcerate.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities neutralize peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights, also activists, to remind their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions on both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the daily Azamn, its clamping, and the custody of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for freedom of press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper that has been reported on corruption in Oman (absolute monarchy) since its foundation in 2007 until they were forbidden by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chief Editor of Azamn, who had appeared in the newspaper on July 26, 2016 with the title "High-ranking parties involving hands of the judiciary" was published in the Judicial and the interference of high-level officials.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, member of the promotion's Committee, was invited to the special department and was arrested on his arrival by the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS adopted the deputy chief editor Yousef Al-Haj who, after Al-Maamaran arrest, participated in Chief Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper had been closed indefinitely after the information Secretary had given the statement that "the publication and distribution of the paper on any way, including online from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On September 26, 2016, the first trial proceedings against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place in Mascat.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of interruption of public order, "abuse of the internet" and "excavation of the government."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found guilty of violation of a public ban and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three-year penalties and fines in the amount of 3000 omic Rial (7800 US dollars). moreover, a one-year professional ban was imposed against the two journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in jail and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after making use of an information network to spread materials that could represent a danger to public order. "</seg>
<seg id="2569">A security deposit of 5000 omic Rial (13 000 US dollars) was set for Al-Abri and was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri's extradition hearing on 26 December 2016, however, condemned Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari to six months of prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 in prison by the central prison in Mascat. al-Haj is still in prison where he served his sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also decided the decision of the Information Ministry to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the court to authorize Azamn, the newspaper sees itself as before attacks by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information received an order that extended the closure of "Azamn" to be extended three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further directive on which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister informed himself another time against the decision of the Appeals Court, the publication of the newspaper again.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The perpetual closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases linked to press freedom in Oman at recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For further injuries, for example, the closure of the independent journal Mowatin and the exercising of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online paper of the country to stop their operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Following the closure of Azamn and imprisoned journalists Al-Haj, the impression is that the omanic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the freedom of freedom of press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls on the omanic authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj immediately release and unconditionally.</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. a safe environment to create the newspaper Azamn so that their journalists can pursue their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. protect the freedom of press in the country, and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. under all circumstances, human rights advocate and journalists take refuge in Oman their rightful human rights work and without fear of retaliatory measures, including judicial vericans.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Medical research in Africa: opportunities and misconceptions</seg>
<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, image takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addressed one of the most urgent requirements of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the demand on-site medical research there are two reasons: for one missing in the offer of global healthcare systems, many medicines and vaccines that cover special medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have widespread impact elsewhere in the poorest countries in Africa, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a great problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research that is conducted by African scientists itself will only be eligible for the development of its own research capacities in Africa. a larger role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first grazing effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he used himself on the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and over misconceptions of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research theme?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work on the application of research results. I also supported the sambische national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2600">Moreover, I launch a research program for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important recent scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we just put solutions that have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise, we will always remain the receivers instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find appropriate scientists for projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the United States and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or want to come here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age classes.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need of special scientific training, starting in every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, Big Data, exploration of the Welfare, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa over western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the basic access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called "Paywall") is also limited to the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the United States to India: how to change "Open Source" seed producers the worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which has been reported on solutions to environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton already bred the lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as outlining, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work has been set out only by its own income and the question as many of the salami types can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he remarked that more and more salads were patented, and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual types, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor, or sprayed sheets.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years, more of such patents have been registered for more plants such as grain or flashcards. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security ensure the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still bred salad, but he now needs longer, since his work has always been frightened because of getting more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is as I lie in a river a rock that has to be blamed.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we need to do that now, but it is a rupture with the tradition of tradition, "he says." I think these patents go to far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand before the court, no one can chastise a new salinity because all features are already patented. "he makes it as good as possible and tried to breed the features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavoured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement connected in the US and in the world anywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeder).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts at the International Space Station ISS have been cultivated and eaten red Roman-salat of the "greenhouse" station of the station and eaten. there we have been tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name is rather like that it would come from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative of "open source" seed) "is inspired by the movement for free" Open Source "software to provide the alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was set up in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property, and thus permanently used for plant breeders permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to it that others may use farmed seed freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders allow only others to breed their seed instead, to breed in such own varieties, and not immediately preselected - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant patente.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi member board, Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays an important role in larger interrelations like biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by eating seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement did not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified, or not, for organic agriculture, says he and takes us to buy more frequently asked merger in the global agricultural industry, such as it will be offered for example to farmers markets, such as it is bred to farmers markets, such as this vegetable is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereign debt without seed-confident people is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to make others their seed freely available to provide you with this, in contrast to this, seed and plant attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supplies are jeopardised, as the Genetic pool is due to the increasingly variety of intellectual property rights on plant material that is always restricted, unfailing.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Managing Director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with Genetic Variation at carrots and its availability. it found out that about one-third of all boxes are protected as intellectual property, which is either suitable for plant breeders either at all or less.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are still not yet, but experts such as Luby suggest that massaging plants like wheat in even greater style can be patented as a salad or carrot.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of sight</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in this way that they feature targeted features - of such, improves their taste or color, to such a source, due to which they thrive in certain environments such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Adversaries of patents to plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by increasingly more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genes and cooperation with institutions such as the State Department of the United States, the company set up the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts the view that intellectual property rights include other breeders, since "patents and the protection of plant diversified innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent is expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such a protection will not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by making the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expelling, but certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for such a long time to breed with plants, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the battle would have been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and still should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to take advantage of the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton interferes with the concept to patented the Plant-features: "we do not really create the characteristics of itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and, as breeders, we ultimately don't know how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Ossi Executive Board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever bred a variety, also maintains its own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with great farms and monocultures, for which cultivation of herbicides, are cultivated in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very gentecy. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are patents, they create the most smaller seeds, even without patents - either they reject it or maintain it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the opinion that breeders should be innovative by avoiding plant patented products: "it looks like I do with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years itself, "he says." with a patent we are protected against competition 20 years before your opinion. "global resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seem to be leading leading to the "Open Source," the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "(Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which itself describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is an open-source "seed programme." together with farmers, the center works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain demands.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seed seed and sell its own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol works on an open-source license that ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, because Ossi's obligation is not easy to use one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventionally grown plants should not be patentious. thus, she is referring to the present practice of the European Patent Office, the patents are allowed on conventionally grown plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">One explanation is, however, not a law; now it is involved in governments of the Member States, to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on the open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of plant banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to experience a little about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend towards promoting seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos'Programme for "Open Source" seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed systems, for which scheduled next year will be the official starting signal.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development aid (including Hivos, the international nonprofit organization USC Canada and the Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aid organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report must be allowed to contribute to seeds that can be replaced and contribute to the seed sector, so that a stable supply can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report, the importance of a varied, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a connection between Luby by Ossi hopes that soon more people will be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has primarily considered, where, and how little is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now attempting to clarify the people that more than their food is."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August the Egyptian government closed the website of the Tour Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about that.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook in which it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step, criticised and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">In spite of this attack and the recognition of the Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities, to defend this goal, it was never so important as now. ANHRI was not so important as now. ANHRI was confirmed that all technical possibilities were exhausted to overcome the blocking, and not review. we hope to continue our task further.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked my independent news page Mada Masr, arabic language version of the Huffington Post and Qatar-based Network of Al Jazeera for terrorism. "</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web lockouts to victims. @ anhri is one of the major sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZMopDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and Human Rights research scientist Ahmed Gamal Ziada does not have access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for spreading columnists and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog, which he addressed to circumvent the Zensurry apparatus of the Egyptian government, is the objective of a attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, which is native to the Ziadas blog, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video like the police accused physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article is mainly turning around politics and human rights issues in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook commentary, Ziada was outlined by the government and reflected what it means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">It is very old, but it is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is successful to give me the feeling of a siege to me; An arrest, a attempted murder, unloading at the national Security Council, the blocking blogs, as well as any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to item from articles to avoid censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, however, after having locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The Mugen go the way up to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) closed Egyptian authorities from 24th May to 06. August 133 websites. this ergents technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE, there also documented the blocking of providers, by transferring internet censorship and private surfing, called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we saw how the plying of websites that VPNs had started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter out the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also intensified by the fact that the Censurination decisions are hit behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis using them to proceed in court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">Fighting the inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Daily newspapers in Brazil, with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city of the country and home of many posters.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these lines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old killed in school" "Each second day a police officer was killed in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves violate pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temers sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air Force in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense-tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The International Non-Governmental Organisation Global Justice initiated even the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports about these are everyday life and this is unacceptable and # 8212; at least find the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">The magazine published for the detailed coverage on violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on August 16, the Editorial "That is not normal," in which she announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision declared the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city on the world like murder, robbery, sexualverting, etc. everything that has happened from the civilized standard and what only happened in Rio will be called "War in Rio" (...) This is our way to call: that's not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so as journalists don't close our eyes to the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes declared that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war rubrik in a country that cannot recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist declared that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 territories there is one of the criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used, atrocities of the police that shoots first and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and their partner.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the term "war" more than they use?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argued that violence as a "war" argued that this would be a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to draw the responsibility for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of the field interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with unsatisfactory investments in personnel, education and a historical and selfily neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent spot in Brazil," according to Cecília is false: "22 of the 30 violent most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north east of the country. these are the most up-to-date information.</seg>
<seg id="2778">No such cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">When we look at the Morrates per state, Rio is on No.16, "she writes.</seg>
<seg id="2780">Specially, the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, emphasises such as Cecília, the number of security policy in the State for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">One of these safety policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificora), one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer the favela of a massive police unit and stationed a unit permanently there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this resulted in a decrease of violent deaths. since a few years, the UPP took to protect the police and pressions against the poor municipalities which should actually protect the neo-created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux from one of his articles published in 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio won't represent the criteria for the term "civil war" by the Geneva Convention.</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">Besides legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls for the state, means and ways to use typical for war. this includes intrusion into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is a non-sharp point in the countryside and for the object for "collateral damages" and "veritable balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War or her, fact is that the residents of Favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that police have klash the mountain to the Favela Jacarezinho in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: an orcharist died due to shots that had fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly through the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the PAX Peace Organisation and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly strong, where an attack with chemical weapons required the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and Syrian opposition, are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these have been controlled by rebels controlled by the siege of Damascus, which led to the fact that inhabitants rely on locally produced or quilted foods with tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">By the years of blockage, traditional food supplies such as meat has become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">In consideration, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and lead the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms not belong to conventional, planted in Syria, and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, it makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged east Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, subscription Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate the cultivation of fungus because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that had been fighting for three years ago to make this project announced, and pushed out his relief that it will now win more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, use in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to convey 125 families of knowledge to plant mushrooms, Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations on CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is relied on generators, which maintain the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortages, locally manufactured greenhouse gases are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the "production of pilgrims from the regions of pilgrims," before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Afterwards they planted a small mushroom court in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a bigger bowl. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have developed a "apprentice yard for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms throughout the east Ghouta for free.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"we want to teach people the fungus for different reasons": fraction of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2825">Delivering a new food source on the market.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Spread of a culture of self-sufficiency, by eating habits (such as paper, tea, coffee fish, cardboard, etc) will be used to extraction new foodstuffs.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Creating new jobs, especially for women who work home.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Creating new jobs for people with disabilities, who are bound to their home.</seg>
<seg id="2829">He said, "We hope to spread this idea around the world, so that our success as well as our struggle against hunger and siege is visible.</seg>
<seg id="2830">We want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="2831">The interview with Dr. Ahmed Leila was carried out by Joey Ayoub and by Elias Abou Jaoude.</seg>
<seg id="2832">Portuguese calls for Justice for the Victims of 2017</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people were protestant on 21 October in many neighbourhoods in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that grated in the north of Portugal in the week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Two-two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between the 15th and 16th October. this led to that the government proclaimed last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires are also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 light bursts that spread to the north and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, Pedrógão Grande was a similar tragedy, where the fires gave 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry monitoring system, which supervised the forest areas by satellite photos, there are about 500,000 acres of forest in 2017, covering an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So you can make a better picture of Ernst the situation: there is no fire in 4 boroughs.</seg>

<seg id="2843">Numerous videos spread in the net and show images that allow better insights into the event:</seg>
<seg id="2844">The foreseeable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The goal of the protests from Saturday was the requirement for better preemptive and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People asked why the civil protection was not able to concomfy the extent of tragedy as far as possible</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral, by the federal government of Portugal, declared the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">According to Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did nowhere: there are dozens of reports from open streets, surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria a similar tragedy happened as in June, as the streets were closed very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, construction permits in estrities are injected with high spirits.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far reaching proposal for the forest, which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005, has been communicated by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government led a bill of the law that allowed the construction activity of the case, if the applicant had a means of self-protection, that was an open backdoor that everything could be built," João Sorval is continuing the same article in the newspaper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus made it carefully that large areas with eucalyptus trees made of light-flammable wood, as in a vicious circle, continues to spread to the fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">To these problems, the website of the Civil Protection Act of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, sought out as a population information or attempted to contact relatives, relatives was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it used its own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time via the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developers of João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial that the servers were over the 400,000 users who pursued the fires, not steady: there were more than half a million.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In a night in the autumn of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible war was broken between the different Mujahedin groupings that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Exactly at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family dinner together.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother never said it at that time, she knew that she would no longer see her son - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, was killed just by the Taliban and felt indignant with Hazara.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban dragged along for their hatred for the Hazara well-known Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohesitation. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left out of his minor salary, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed bags with mortars that were heavier than he himself to make himself up his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan Refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked also.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so we don't be shaken at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day meal in needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is also true, however, that the conditions that seekers asylum seekers are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organization Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, "the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in more than 3000 "special recording centers" at this time, with improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian Law, asylum seekers can then be allocated to a admission center if officially put an application for asylum -which can still be passed after the registration of the asylum seeker.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Up to then people who have no money for accommodation, either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also called Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unstable lifetimes helped Asharaf to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made various works in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf had its entire savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">It went so well that he opened a second hostel after a while and a schnellimb opened.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Ashark Baratis Success Story is now subject of documentation "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - an Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, several of Afghanistan served companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of its Restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The restaurant's menu tells about the various Afghani, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts the story of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opens the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also in Afghanistan too.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharafs aims to go far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade, and aim to the country that he had to be forced to leave as teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where an risk is, there are possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forget my country and I can't live happy if I know my people suffers.</seg>
