that is James R@@ isen .
you might know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times reporter .
a long time before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA heard illegal teleph@@ ones from Americans .
but it &apos;s another chapter , which should leave a permanent impression .
this is how he describes a cat@@ astro@@ phic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally exceeded them for a nuclear bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not liked the chapter ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years , the government established against R@@ isen and called him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became the symbol of the pattern of the government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , and rep@@ ul@@ ing journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Law the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right , if media is not able to protect this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ le they give .
so when the government kno@@ cked at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous journalists did before him : he refused and said he would rather go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , even though they were essential for years that it would be essential to fall , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the rep@@ orters and sources can always hide themselves less .
instead of failure and roug@@ h@@ ers to statements , that could also do his digital Foot@@ prints for him .
and so investig@@ ators , without his consent , concerned his phone conversation ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank@@ rupt@@ cy , its credit rating , and even travel tips with the list of flights .
in the midst of these information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and cra@@ cks .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer &apos;s accus@@ ation . but instead , justice condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is home to much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of being a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to a journalist .
so we set the press coverage on the game , which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has more opportunities to pi@@ onate .
but the same as technology allows to circum@@ vent rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and though they can contact it from the moment they receive contact , instead of entering in , in the witness stand .
today there are communication software that had not been written as R@@ isen , and it is considerably more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source project for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer which was originally developed by the Internet &apos;s famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and today is from Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work , has been developed .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload or send documents , like in any ordinary form of contact .
these are then encrypted and saved on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot afford more information , and many of the information that they would claim would not be available from the out@@ set .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world will always develop new spy technologies that end@@ anger us all .
it &apos;s hard to make sure that not only technology ken@@ ner like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to add mis@@ ery . it &apos;s equally important that we protect the next w@@ rest@@ le@@ blo@@ wer ,
the loss of ab@@ normal@@ ities in the supply of soldiers about modest and over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental processor , the alarm will be ch@@ av@@ ed to the poll@@ uted water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who warns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest data le@@ ck of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and vali@@ ant &#93; have hidden &#91; the enormous sum of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ases . &#93; This week we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to an explanation . &#93; This week we received from news about an area of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s local law firm Mos@@ que fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we receive an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you do this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , exchange messages , how the entire system works as it works .
this has already led to very first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has stepped down .
also , there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens has .
it claims that a trace of $ 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads through a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there &apos;s a lot of rich people out there and others who wait at the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of a agency agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ ROM .
it seems to be crying from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we address this ?
but the truth is , if the wealthy and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens , and not all their taxes pay , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , and streets .
and that affects us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in the world discuss media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some of the few used to hide and wear it -- something that we have been discussing and un@@ veil their money for ten years .
I think many people will appear very conf@@ using this whole world and it &apos;s difficult to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine like a mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer .
it can be very difficult for prosec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans now , that occurred in these revel@@ ations , sc@@ andal .
well , it is not so that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle , after which this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples to see connections in the United States .
in fact , it is so that there is less information in some US states to give less information to establish a company than to get a library .
this kind of intri@@ gu@@ ing in the USA has allowed employees to bring school children down to school children .
it has been allowed to withdraw especially vulnerable investors .
it is this type of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does this work ?
therefore , we sent an investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 Bar companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African ministers who wanted to bring the susp@@ ects money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked us that all up to a lawyer to our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ ferences . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was handed over to money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer , who sp@@ read@@ ed out his secret investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politicians , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it &apos;s about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ as@@ ion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to handle this , we need to change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this type of behaviour .
this may sound very reasonable , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing has ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful powers .
but as a new@@ born optim@@ ist , I absolutely see that some things began to change .
in the past couple of years , we have seen advance to more transparency , which concerns the owners of firms .
political attention was found by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been involved in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really stands behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is behind here .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill of Parliament in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this vast insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure in the US and globally for greater transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are fur@@ ious when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lines .
we need managers in the economy that arise and say , &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use themselves to end by laws this kind of in@@ transparency .
together we can finally end this kind of tax ev@@ as@@ ion , corruption and money la@@ undering , finally ending this type of tax ev@@ as@@ ion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story , as I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das would be landed .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my opinion .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and made just a road trip to the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me thr@@ illed how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go to peace @-@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small car boot !
then I heard say : &quot; I have an air @-@ wearing . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; Can , how please ? &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what happened to me here ?
a wild@@ card sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I stepped out of the bed , at Z@@ eh@@ en@@ ik@@ es to the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy .
we are still in touch .
the work of art that he bought from me is on the class@@ room today . he is a teacher now .
it was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewing angles .
perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers , actually friends who were waiting for you to be discovered ?
people on my air ra@@ kes was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air ra@@ kes .
let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , nearly ple@@ a , my fellow occup@@ ant attracts , and the rent will be increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were booked out .
I think creativity can do it to turn fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new Mit@@ bewohner Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I was thinking about how we could earn something . our apartment will stay for a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and started so &quot; air ra@@ kes and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air wooden floor on wood floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes are completely different , because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we were welcomed our last guest and the door to the castle , Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and could pay for our rental ?
things came in rolling .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ pot@@ czy@@ k , decided to join us as a developer .
we would find out whether you could make a business concept .
so we presented our investors : &quot; we want to create a site where people publicly posts from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms which includes doors if you come past .
via the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited , that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but did not do it .
no one who is still very consol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because , as children all have learned that foreign lands are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you will discuss the things you can . we have designed out .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than look and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create confidence by design imm@@ ick confidence between men who never met before .
can design do so anything ?
is it possible to create with Design Confi@@ dence ?
I want to give you a taste , which degree trust we request .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I want you to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat .
this quiet pick@@ up of panic that you can sense now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door the first time .
for the only thing , what is personal as your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the barrier of a strange woman in his hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
you will also feel the most guests to stay somewhere else .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
only once , who is actually Al Go@@ res mobile ?
could you tell us on Twitter that he dict@@ ates the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have experienced now what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced with his name ; if he had told how he comes from , how his dog or his children are promised ?
imagine you would have 150 convic@@ tions that all say : &quot; he can really un@@ lock out cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ known feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative convic@@ tions .
in the end , we decided to wait for both hosts and guest appearances , before we presented them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we carried out with Stan@@ ford for a study . we investigated how likely it is that people depend on each other how much they are in terms of age and residence .
surprisingly , we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
if you have less than three ass@@ essments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation of view simil@@ arities .
thus , the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted amb@@ ass@@ adors .
moreover , we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you are reas@@ onably priced .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
when you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
you tell too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- -- will the request also not be accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , such as &quot; hand@@ some art pieces in your apartment ! I make holidays with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create this degree to op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on what topics it should write something .
our entire company is based on hope that the right design can help , overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
with what we did not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than willing to dis@@ close this pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
firstly : unbelie@@ v@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need to have been covered before .
for us , business is going very well .
of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who are un@@ allowed parties , or homes have been rav@@ aged .
hosts will leave guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood on the front , when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it &apos;s hurt , if I just remember .
the dis@@ appointment , which was heard in the voice of the call@@ ers , was , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
fortunately , only a fraction had ever had a problem of 123 millions .
because people confi@@ ded in one another .
when confidence is working , there can be wonderful curi@@ os@@ ities .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host went to hospital .
he even raised blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers , who tend to attack heart attack due to sitting activities .
the neighborhood is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angel , who save one life , even though they don &apos;t know it at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lon@@ ely , they are passing books .
you can stay a longer stay without charging the extra nights .
I recommend it highly ! &quot;
of course , not every stay will go .
but these relations behind the pure money transactions are exactly what you want to reach with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled on this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of participating with money transactions fit together ?
it &apos;s all about a economic trade .
but we just call it &quot; rental industry , &quot; the thing is not just to do .
Share Economy describes a trade in human relations .
people put out a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you fall today it is to be compared with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic .
what would , however , if traveling a rich buffet would be from local revenue ?
what if in every place you visit , a group there would wait to fill a group there and to show a bar for the bar , of which one has never heard ;
or if you want to cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are arranged according to the privacy principle .
what if we would like to share apartments for reason ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities were supposed to have the thought of common share ?
I imagine cities that allow ourselves to society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and sc@@ ot@@ ation .
in South Korea , the project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the Government ,
now people were offered . students that were looking for a lead ,
were facil@@ itated by people whose children were out , In@@ cub@@ ator programs were launched ,
in order to fund new start @-@ ups in the Share economy , there are 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries with a fore@@ igner or even hosts in 191 countries .
so the idea seems to not be so crazy about how it was taught .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality has also been there before .
there were similar websites to us .
so why did it work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that we can find the right design with the parts of trust .
design may help us to overcome profound pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find that amaz@@ ingly ,
overwhelming .
I have to think about it , if a red Maz@@ da goes on me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for the future .
thank you .
what do you think , when you watch me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , under@@ under@@ wear a counter @-@ under@@ wear , a terrorist act ?
or just a delay in safety at the airport .
that is indeed true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
so , the media represent it , which look like me .
a study indicated that 80 % of the reporting is negative about Islam and Muslims .
studies show : Americans think most would not know Muslims .
presumably the people don &apos;t talk to their competitors .
for those who have never met a Muslims : it is great to identify you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double Espresso , with whi@@ pped cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a c@@ tur@@ nal Fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ k@@ erin
and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga singing , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to join this .
when I was 17 I met the decision to ou@@ sted .
no , not as homosex@@ ual man , like some of my friends but as the Muslim . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist independent declaration of independence , with the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to watch me a perfect and un@@ at@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only passi@@ vely received the faith of my parents .
I have Con@@ clu@@ sions with the Koran .
I read him , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow de@@ vot@@ ion that deep@@ ened themselves with every reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of rhythm is sometimes brought me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone takes you to complete you completely , and somehow he loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and began how all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineers .
later on , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the Egyptian American dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
as smoke , aircraft flew into buildings , people spar@@ rows out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock has changed quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should I do such a thing ?
I changed the channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim &quot; terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh , my God .
it was not only my country , but in the N@@ u turned me the deeds of others from a citizen in a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to drive through the middle west of the USA to move into a new city and begin to graduate studies .
I remember how I drove him -- as deep as we went into my seat , and I was afraid for the first time , as the Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new town where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , when I heard , I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; unle@@ ashed in well lit places , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day that Muslims gather for prayer .
and again the war@@ nings had said : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot;
I saw my extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ able , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or men , which they held for Muslims , taken into the free @-@ breaking and struck .
there were really bran@@ ding on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something was not felt right .
because the people , who had attacked this country , attacked our country .
I tried to get the rage of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy , constantly to explain .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations which are hard .
today , we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in that country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ icious tumor is removed as a whole , and a ben@@ ign tumor is only ob@@ serving under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , gifts and Olymp@@ ians .
will the closure of Mos@@ ques United States be safer ?
maybe there will be a few parking spaces , but do not stop the terror .
regular visits to a mosque is leading to people of other faith toler@@ ate , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer .
in the radical process , it was found that he starts online . as a result , the person is separated from their church , even from their family so that the extre@@ mes of their family believes that the terrorists be the true Muslims , and everyone who dis@@ car@@ ded their behavior and ide@@ ology is a tra@@ itor or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some of them are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group of IS establishes its breeding ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , a mother , as a person , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would like to add to their imagination , if you recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
but when you throw a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things in Scripture .
a remarkable Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing history :
a girl came to him , because she had prec@@ eded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , with whom she had spoken , brought her silence and told her that her anger , her mind for in@@ justice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
of nothing insp@@ ires and something that would make sense of their anger , she was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts that made a solution .
this Ima@@ m introduced the connection to God and its church .
rather than acc@@ use them for their anger , he demonstrated its construc@@ tive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
it was an insight , like Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family .
but how does it affect the normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- basically several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , happen at least three things .
we accept rather a author@@ itarian governmental system , con@@ formity , and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if one reported testing individuals in which negative over Muslims has been reported , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
if you look , when the mood against Muslims left up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism , as I expected it .
it may actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public to liber@@ ate the foundations of a free society , reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims are a early warning sign .
we feel it perhaps as first , but the toxic air of fear causes us to all .
with the assignment of collective debt , it is not only about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when did the young man have become a diversi@@ fied young man ? &quot;
only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne &apos;s visit to her brother and wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as he posted a statement against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be mor@@ ally , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or stayed at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision , because it was because we would like to leave our children to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided to go to the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove silence , with high pressure towards the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes came out , and went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , stopped me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers , who had come to attack us , but to join us .
at this moment , I have broken .
these people were there because they had courage , compassion , and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ at@@ ism ?
will you be sure to go on number ?
or you will connect to those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thanks a lot !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say that you are saying that you &apos;re holding a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a thinking with deep @-@ pass , that is an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say don &apos;t fool you . I am completely normal .
I am no exception to this .
my story is not unusual .
I am so ordinary as it is allowed .
if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest in the study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am an exception in any regard .
when people appear as an exception , then the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler , a billi@@ on@@ aire line is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire line .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for professional dr@@ ones . possible in research institutions around the world .
before air @-@ p@@ etting started in our social consciousness , autonomous fleet of air machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France were built live in front of an audience six meters high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they started to fly with ro@@ pes .
through inter@@ locking devices , high speed and acceleration reached in tight spaces .
they can also build self @-@ bearing structures .
they have learned to carry loads , to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility within the autonomous flight .
in order to make a system autonomous , it must be collective to know where the mobile objects are located in the space .
in our laboratory on the ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board , what the machine should do .
external commands are available on top floors , e.g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter ,
an aircraft that tries to beat two flies with one fla@@ p .
like other starters , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
unlike most starting @-@ wings it can ho@@ ver , and it has great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a flip side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ fish is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ences like wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device is capable of re@@ leg@@ ating the optimum position and improves performance by practic@@ ing .
okay .
during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions , which causes the core of the matter .
such a question would be , for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about as machines with a thousand moving parts that accum@@ ulate you to inj@@ ure you .
decades ago , we managed to fly remote @-@ controlled flying equipment that had only two moving parts : one prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ dder .
far , we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ ulated flight machine . it was invented in front of short .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ru@@ des , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , just one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , in the inner life much , so that it can fly stable , and move in space over .
nonetheless , it does not have the elegant Algorith@@ m of the rear side . to get it to fly , I must throw it exactly right .
the probability to throw it exactly when I all see is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleas@@ ures , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the greater ability to offer ,
in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is shot , or even as it rot@@ ates .
naturally it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is dar@@ ker in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s see that on .
when air machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
when you build it together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- can move the machine further if also restricted .
we will demonstrate this , as we do half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic she@@ ds .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took usual Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter - each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms .
every unit knows where space is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think out of new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine because you would like to fly a flying lamp on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the reward is in the development and the creative act .
it serves as memory , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe , and that it allows creative , smart heads to form them in so spectacular ways .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , is the t@@ ittle of the i .
thank you very much .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far distant galax@@ ies becomes faster , they turned the mass of three s@@ uns in a ten@@ ths of pure energy .
for this short moment , they lighten@@ ed brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole famous universe .
it was a very great cre@@ all .
but their energy they were not free in the form of light --
and finally we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given in the space time @-@ feeling and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
almost 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God arise - even the Internet .
approximately 25 years ago , a group of especially cour@@ age@@ ous -- Ra@@ i Weiss recently decided to build a huge laser detector from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the C@@ alt@@ ech to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colon@@ izing black holes .
most stopped them for crazy .
but enough people recognized it as crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : laser interfer@@ ometer Ob@@ servatory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which improved recognition performance .
therefore we call him Advanced Lig@@ o now .
early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clari@@ fy some minor problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ zing black holes passed through the ground .
they walked through you and me
and through the detector through .
Scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell of my to@@ d@@ ill father .
in essence , these were the fruits of my life .
all this what I had worked for , is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cist on the MIT . he has been studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their through ob@@ struc@@ tions like Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a cr@@ us@@ ement in the feeling of space and time .
when over@@ crossing the shaft , the space and its entire content will be stretched in one direction and put it into the other .
illustr@@ ative c@@ ures in courses for rel@@ ativity theory often perform a really al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretch and du@@ ck , stretch and du@@ ck . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely low , even ridic@@ ulous .
on September 14 , for example , every one of us was de@@ posed and st@@ icking by us at the meeting of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by one 1 . therefore , one declared the Lig@@ o staff to go crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a nuclear failure . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text over Gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves , follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when construc@@ ting such det@@ ectors are vast .
but physi@@ cists are fin@@ der@@ ful and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims to be Lig@@ o &apos;s more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what that meant .
visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phones .
this is quite practical . because so you can make a picture or map of things , by perc@@ ei@@ ving that of several points coming to you around you .
in tones , that is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean especially much :
to the child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as sound and pitch , rhythm , and volume to close on the story behind it .
&quot; right now says Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob is interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make any simple pictures of objects in all .
but by paying attention to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least there are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
when we convert wave pattern to sound , we can hear that literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation , too , can betra@@ y us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , referring to my colleague Scott already very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ turning holes , circul@@ ates simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you can hear the same cl@@ amps with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of motion detector , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that I must never forget -- heard the sound of Some@@ one , knows what he must hear , this sound as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ speed mass mass , which rotate approximately as fast as the bars of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : do we have to think about what that means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve each one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as they never had ever been possible .
on this way , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in all , we can not see -- practical or basically -- not seen .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ ager stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of these , we have learned a lot about the universe .
the ant@@ alizing physical processes occur at the core , which lies behind thousands of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never see , because these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are penet@@ rating iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ scar@@ is : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Ur@@ scar@@ f is hidden by its own after@@ g@@ low .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most import@@ antly : I am optimi@@ stic that we don &apos;t have seen in all things we never seen , which we will never see , and of which we have no idea . things we can only discover by listening .
indeed , Lig@@ o found the first run of things we did not expect .
my colleague is MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this theme : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the suction cups for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o enables us to view a totally different perspective on the events of all , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we were coming out of this may@@ hem .
AA : the challenge is now to be so cour@@ age@@ ous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the cos@@ mos of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a brand new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and all .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now the time is great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
for a year , I would say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of that .
regardless of whether it made me nervous , brought me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
do I want to be live in television ?
no , but yes !
did I want to begin with the show ?
no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : that &apos;s what I was afraid of , my fear terri@@ fied .
my fear , to keep words , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life , un@@ expect@@ edly . it began with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; sk@@ itt@@ ens , &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
she asked her once , whether I could play with her , when I was just at the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
yes , this is the beginning
there was a new life setting in my family . from there I w@@ asted to play with them whenever you do me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or whi@@ ther I &apos;m going , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I stri@@ ve to stri@@ ve .
it has a magical effect on me , on my kids , to our family .
but it also has an amaz@@ ingly low effect : it was just a short time ago , that &quot; Yes &quot; - S@@ agen to play my career with my children .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things , aw@@ aking up for life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I &apos;m producing television .
I make TV , in a big style .
I am responsible for this TV @-@ season to spend 70 hours of schedule in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously production .
each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
another episode has nine days of TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programs , which are simultaneously in production , mal four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series run one another on Thursday night .
all over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created itself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ tru@@ cking . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans for camp fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who this is still doing ?
no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press you .
I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you , that all of you who are working so hard , whether you &apos;re a company , a country or a class@@ room , take a business or a class@@ room , so that you can understand that I don &apos;t just walk around your computer and I say , I understand that it doesn &apos;t dream about dreams .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , everything blood , everything sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ening into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work creates a country out of nothing .
it is , when I introduced troops , I painted on a screen .
so as a single sound , one will find a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , clin@@ ically and maternal , clin@@ ically and maternal , fierce and sensible . and the best part is that sum@@ s .
there &apos;s so a change in me when the work goes well .
a sum starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s li@@ stens to a busy street , I could go for ever .
many people assume that I explain the sum@@ s that I speak , that the writing will be writing to me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with television production when I began working and working and working , build , create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
it is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , you cannot stri@@ ve different than size .
feeling , not different to stri@@ ve than to stri@@ ve for , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a workouts .
perhaps there is gen@@ ius .
perhaps it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask it .
to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work more , the more I am writing , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what about work ?
I love work , aren &apos;t I ?
the country , which I create , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ taken , exagger@@ ated , burned .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now , my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that their m@@ um is a only working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; Oh , I want to go to Sh@@ onda @-@ Land . &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are a baby @-@ titanium .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s stopped .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I just loved my job anymore . the engine was out of course .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , continuous weekend , no re@@ mor@@ se , no re@@ union , a titanium sleeps , does not give up , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was an indication @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so , what do you do when doing what you &apos;re doing , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
I know some may think : &quot; loc@@ ust yourself , &quot; the author of the author of Titan . &quot;
but you know , you &apos;re doing it , you are working to be a ban@@ ker , a ban@@ ker , a mother who knows how the sum@@ s feels , and know how the sum@@ s does not know when the sum@@ s stops if the sum@@ s stops , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when I hear the song of my heart , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; South @-@ States @-@ Kell@@ ner &quot; asks me a question .
I &apos;m on the way out there , late and she says : &quot; mom , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no more than I would be aware of two things :
first , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , they don &apos;t called me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; shame . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I am Titan bin and my Sum@@ mon . here everything changes before my own eyes .
and this is what she says : &quot; mom , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and play their sisters , we laugh so much and I &apos;m reading quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the spring , I can &apos;t do anything but to fit .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country , which I create , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything that exists , stick@@ y fingers and hum@@ id shots , tender voices , wax sti@@ p@@ ens and the song , in which it goes about , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Age &quot; is extingu@@ ished .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air on this place is so short that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I &apos;m happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door is coming up and an energy boost is coming in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working sum@@ s , the titanium box , that is only the substitute .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I am managing to using Shows and TV hours , and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is not strength and it is not @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the true sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river , which comes from the lust of life .
the true sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
the true sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of the story that are experiencing tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the true sum of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but might you whis@@ per@@ ed God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , a lot more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I am doing this for a regular rule , so that I can free myself as work@@ a@@ vers from each guilt .
it &apos;s a law , I have no choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to listen to Sum@@ mon .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it .
you do not play a wh@@ opping , like working .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work as at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , for what man is working rather than to be home ?
well yes , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too sensitive , none of it .
we shave around in the garden , back and back , round and forth .
we make little dance @-@ parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mainly with stiff , absent and confused .
I always travel to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how you are living , and the sum@@ s of the universe ful@@ fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the games ?
you can also ! let &apos;s say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you &apos;ve got me for na@@ ive , for a day@@ dream woman .
there you do good , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ Show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes with me until they want to make something different .
they are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or C@@ eks replaces me .
and my teen @-@ daughter speaks for 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more need it .
each one can lift every 15 minutes , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a day !
no mobile , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children wish to bed .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well@@ being , my world . it must not be the children . it applies to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; games &quot; in general .
indul@@ ge in the 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find out it and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I won victories . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show , when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to exc@@ el myself more and more .
15 minutes per piece , why don &apos;t you indul@@ ge in 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
work doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a couple of months , a door opens up and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melo@@ dic , it fills me and my soul . it seduc@@ es me to new ideas . that sum@@ s up , I use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and stick@@ y fingers , dinner with friends .
that is now my Sum@@ mon .
that sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just one part . I am so grateful for that .
it is my lip that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything in handle . my brain is still working . my camp fire is still burning .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country , which I create , the marathon which I run , the troops , the screens , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other , the right sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more it makes this unusual , sin@@ ning , naked and new feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think of things , I aw@@ aken about life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dream .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to have less work and too more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I &apos;m Neuro@@ surgical I .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the others , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us Neuro@@ surgeon is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very small ability to self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgical surgery .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve function by various surgical interventions .
for sure they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stim@@ ulation . &quot; it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to affect the circuits of neur@@ ons that improves neuro@@ logical function .
it &apos;s truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that had heavy trem@@ or and heavy pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ He@@ aling .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we are approaching this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a leader and worked day and night in the notebook .
often I provided patients with sk@@ ul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that the brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a would in@@ feed the brain and incl@@ ined to the skull pressure on the skull .
to save life , one needs to dimin@@ ish the skull pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of a weak@@ ened brain mass .
rather than to throw away brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
this is no easy task .
cells of a tissue remains , comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
it is necessary to find the correct diet , temperature , humidity , and environments to thri@@ ve it .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with big green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ri@@ mature cells .
perhaps you still know of the biology classes that stem cells are un@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery .
we did another fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they sat slowly and after a couple of weeks , they even died .
thus we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but it was different .
we needed long to understand what they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ tic @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fo@@ etus , they take care of the folding of the brain .
but why stay they getting us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of brain , since we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries .
but that is not so certain .
one thing is clear , however , of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cellular source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to de@@ duct a piece of brain mass from un@@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and afterwards , to mark them in color , to pursue them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transpl@@ antation - car transpl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ im@@ planted these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we rep@@ im@@ planted the same cells in the cereb@@ ral tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we could work with apes .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely disappeared after several weeks , they go back home . the room is already occupied but they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we tested a violation and impl@@ ant@@ able exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been im@@ planted .
the proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells we d@@ yed in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help monkeys to recover from a cereb@@ ral injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual job task .
they had to take animal pellets from a tray .
they made it very well .
when they reached a stable level of skill level , we injured mot@@ orized c@@ ort@@ ex for the mot@@ orized c@@ ort@@ isation area .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen in people , they re@@ spa@@ wn spont@@ aneously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover using plastic bra@@ in@@ ism . it re@@ covering to a certain degree , just like in the apes .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degrees of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side you see the monkey , which collected spont@@ aneously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance in the case of injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the matur@@ ation transpl@@ antation .
I can tell you that we were also very exciting results for us .
since that time , we found very much more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example , in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely fall .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human subjects .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results you have to fill two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through these kind of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : looking into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to see permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can arrive to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
initially , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will we allow the authority to start it soon ?
then one must perform this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to choose the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
afterwards one must apply it to a multi @-@ center study .
you have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
in the West , we are making a great mistake to consider them as of course .
we see democracy , not as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as the inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable ear .
we believe capitalism is inev@@ it@@ ably leading democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have undoubtedly proved that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains un@@ democratic .
indeed , democracy is overcome with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my friends who would repeat that democracy would be abol@@ ished when they would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economical model for a true democracy .
I beg you to believe together with me again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy .
without democracy , our societies are in common , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
regarding waste , I would like to point you at an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our ta@@ vern .
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ summit @-@ par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
one summit is known to you . you know and recognise it as the debt @-@ mountain , which throws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the debt @-@ mountain ,
but few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is heard that are anxi@@ ous to invest , but it may be productive and income , with which one could produce the debt @-@ life and also produce all the things that humanity is urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in the United States , in all the prosperity of producing goods such as industrial facilities , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on and so on .
3.4 trillion U.S. dollars sounds after a lot of money until it compar@@ es with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars , which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing happens , except for stock ex@@ changes and real estate prices .
thus , debt and un@@ productive capital represent the twin summit which cannot be compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the U.S. , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low demand for investors who could not invest in which they are not investing in which it would be true that his son would kill him if he is growing ,
un@@ intenti@@ onally , the circumstances leads , that causes it to kill him .
this is my shar@@ ks with capitalism --
its extremely lav@@ ish art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and to finance them all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are key to rescue the earth .
so , democracy is the solution ?
I think already . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society , in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has , of course , too many !
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error to min@@ ate the focus of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy .
the decision of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was , and is that they were depri@@ ved of the working poor , but not only the right to free expression of expression , but more import@@ antly and decisive , they had the right to agree to political participation with the same m@@ oods in question of state power .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept long though --
like a candle that g@@ lows very light , it is burned too quickly .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , who ultimately became a stat@@ ute for controlling .
for the liberal democracy was only possible when a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was observed in politics , while the economy - so the world of corporations - was a democr@@ atically @-@ free zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when the separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ ex@@ orable battle between the two , while the economy gradually joined the policy and dis@@ ma@@ yed them .
are you wonder@@ ing why politicians are no longer so old as before ?
it is not part of a de@@ generation of DNA .
it is obvious that one can still be in the government but not in power , because the power of politics came down into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that feeds on so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they feed , dec@@ im@@ ated so that at the end it is star@@ ving .
it is similar to the economy that the policy has so far decreased by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations grows , political goods are assessed and the overall economic demand is falling and the managing director of companies are anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the welfare of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we need to bring together the policies and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keep control , like in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
that is not a new idea by the way .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the law from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is only repeated by a miracle as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it , replacing low @-@ glo@@ om employed by automation and robot .
the problem is that as long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation is higher than the twin @-@ level , and the social conflicts is deeper , as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we must resh@@ ape the economy and unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ at@@ ise the re@@ unified area , otherwise we will be appearing in a disease monitoring hyper@@ drive which lets the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation .
the question isn &apos;t , whether capitalism has the technical achievements , which he has produced , will survive --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , resem@@ bles the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are serving to serve human energy in the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life indul@@ ge .
I think we may be optimi@@ stic .
so what would you need to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; like a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the area of the company : ask yourself a capital market prior to which you are working and in which your capital will follow you from a work@@ station to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all revenues from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
there are no distinction no distinction between those who are part of the company , and employees who work there but not belongs to those who are not part of capital and work , no large g@@ aps between investment and austerity and ultimately no emp@@ oral twin @-@ clim@@ bs .
in the field of global political economy : please indicate that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is tra@@ ded - we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum which equ@@ ates to the trade deficit or the country &apos;s trading process , into a mutual funds .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment is rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton Woods conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , in particular , we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe , is at the same time liber@@ ating in which she fav@@ ored individuals , and mar@@ x@@ istic because they have buried the separation of capital and work in tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a true democracy .
become a w@@ aking up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we choose to politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ orial Marx@@ ist in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything about what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do not do this , the technological development create a massive decline in overall economic demand , which means Larry Sum@@ mers as a &quot; long @-@ term st@@ ag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also countries whose interest is minimal in liberal democracy .
if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect .
BG : indeed , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a sort of philosoph@@ ical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said this . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the speakers of the speakers we have clearly said what you think about the view of the West to China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there &apos;s a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the vision of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of the economy -- a completely Christian @-@ free zone .
in a certain way , if I may say this as pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
because -- Do you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was especially scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can be observed in China now , quite similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now taking action to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells amazing to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experience as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginnings with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , we say goodbye to the self @-@ notes , and the continuing den@@ ial that a massive reduction line through the Eurozone , and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity on the basis of Greek pre@@ mon@@ days -- by the way , the first suggestion was to deny this den@@ ial --
to make it right . unfortunately , the forces within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continues to deny the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to obtain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and Auth@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , you may not hesitate for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and de@@ structive .
BG : which change will you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone won &apos;t have any future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as finance ministers ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously juice ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in a so @-@ called situation , he did not make mistakes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course , I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to submit an application for the extension of the cancellation program at the end of February .
I thought there was an honest interest in pages of the investors , to find a common solution .
but it didn &apos;t exist .
they only wanted to bring down our government , only because they did not want to deal with the tests done by the Eurozone .
they did not necessarily wanted to pass through a cat@@ astro@@ phic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika &apos;s Tro@@ ika , imposed on us this policy , was stressed : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ cop@@ ic mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive watch of talks , you seem to be quite right one @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my cr@@ iti@@ que of the European Union and the Eurozone is confron@@ ted by someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone was not survive .
for if she does not survive , the released mur@@ derer shall be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have been cat@@ astro@@ phic consequences for Europe , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we rec@@ essed ourselves to the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , when it appears to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
from Roy Price most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior manager at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , and she describes herself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for producing shows and content to produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard driving sector .
there are so many TV series that Roy not able to choose any .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series at the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows have given this review .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
they are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that you have looked addic@@ ted after a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where is there more of those episodes ? &quot;
that kind of Show .
on the left , here in this end , shows shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I think you need a special intelligence in order to accommodate &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle rec@@ ul@@ sion , the average TV -- the shows that are not good nor bad , they are simply not enth@@ use .
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing so something , that &apos;s why Roy Price wants to risk free .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , and then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can watch for free .
and if Amazon gives out free of things , you can get right , right ?
millions of viewers are looking at this episodes .
however , they do not know that they are watched when watching this shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture , when you start the show , when you p@@ aus@@ ing , which parts you start or check again .
they collect millions of data , in order to decide which show you should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process this and this makes the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make Sit@@ com about four Republican sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many people cannot remember this show , because it was not so good .
it is only an average show - in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
approximately at the same time with another company has pl@@ az@@ ed another manager with data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking for finding this a Super show and he also uses data for it , but he does it a bit different .
instead of running a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows them , etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewer : what shows they like what producers , what actors do .
when they had gathered all the pieces together , they went to a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , data sealed .
they connect these many data together and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
why is that ?
because logic says that things should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you Optimi@@ ze it with very high @-@ performance computers .
the min@@ de@@ ste you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis is not working so , this is something sho@@ ck@@ ingly because we live in a time in which we can take more and more statistics to make serious choices , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ health system is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with this software , you are in jail .
if someone is in prison in the United States and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of the company is used to determine if a dis@@ miss@@ al is done or not .
just like with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . that &apos;s not that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
also the data ir@@ reversible firms are wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis explo@@ sions of flu , the worse species , predic@@ t -- through data analysis of Google &apos;s research .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news location . success cul@@ minated in a release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year around year , until it suddenly wasn &apos;t working anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it was simply not working , it was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data ir@@ reversible firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something .
in spite of all this faul@@ ts , data immer@@ sed in the decisions of life - at the workplace , by the law en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized gen@@ etics - an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I detected some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
as a result , you dis@@ assemble this problem in its parts so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place you put together the items in order to receive a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and packed again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just fine for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put together the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool , and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , there are parts and pieces to put together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to receive a good decision -- especially if the brain is an expert .
that &apos;s why I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , why they were otherwise unable to understand . but the decision to make all these parts , together and make it a show like the House of Cards , &quot; does not stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they left a great personal risk with this decision .
by contrast , Amazon did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV ideas , then they chose an &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to forget it not , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before data existed , this was the device for decisions .
many do know them .
there is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No doubt you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exact here at this moment .
I &apos;ll get it later with a demo demo .
so far I met some choices in my life , with what I should have heard in the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated , like data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the principle .
so maybe the ball is smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it is on us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data still dis@@ bur@@ sed to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and risks involved .
because at the end , it is not the data but the risks involved with which you are landing at the right end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
