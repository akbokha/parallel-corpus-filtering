<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">A long time before someone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA heard illegal telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it's another chapter, which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is how he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally exceeded them for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not liked the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government established against Risen and called him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became the symbol of the pattern of the government, Whistleblower, and repuling journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Law the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right, if media is not able to protect this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mule they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous journalists did before him: he refused and said he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, even though they were essential for years that it would be essential to fall, the government's demands were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide themselves less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and roughers to statements, that could also do his digital Footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so investigators, without his consent, concerned his phone conversation,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and bankruptcy, its credit rating, and even travel tips with the list of flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and cracks.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower's accusation. but instead, justice condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is home to much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of being a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we set the press coverage on the game, which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has more opportunities to pionate.</seg>
<seg id="28">But the same as technology allows to circumvent rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And though they can contact it from the moment they receive contact, instead of entering in, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that had not been written as Risen, and it is considerably more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source project for Whistleblower which was originally developed by the Internet's famous Aaron Swartz, and today is from Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work, has been developed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload or send documents, like in any ordinary form of contact.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and saved on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot afford more information, and many of the information that they would claim would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world will always develop new spy technologies that endanger us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's hard to make sure that not only technology kenner like Edward Snowden have a possibility to add misery. it's equally important that we protect the next wrestleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of abnormalities in the supply of soldiers about modest and overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental processor, the alarm will be chaved to the polluted water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the biggest data leck of the story was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and valiant] have hidden [the enormous sum of money in tax havases.] This week we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to an explanation.] This week we received from news about an area of 11 million documents in Panama's local law firm Mosque fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We receive an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca go and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you do this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, exchange messages, how the entire system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister has stepped down.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad mailbox companies in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">It claims that a trace of $2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads through a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there's a lot of rich people out there and others who wait at the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a agency agent or a John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be crying from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, if the wealthy and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens, and not all their taxes pay, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, and streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the world discuss media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens of some of the few used to hide and wear it -- something that we have been discussing and unveil their money for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will appear very confusing this whole world and it's difficult to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans now, that occurred in these revelations, scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not so that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which this tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples to see connections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that there is less information in some US states to give less information to establish a company than to get a library.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intriguing in the USA has allowed employees to bring school children down to school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been allowed to withdraw especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this type of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does this work?</seg>
<seg id="73">Therefore, we sent an investigator into the offices of 13 Bar companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as an African ministers who wanted to bring the suspects money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all up to a lawyer to our investigator, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preferences. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was handed over to money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer, who spreaded out his secret investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politicians, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to handle this, we need to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this type of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very reasonable, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing has ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful powers.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a newborn optimist, I absolutely see that some things began to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past couple of years, we have seen advance to more transparency, which concerns the owners of firms.</seg>
<seg id="86">Political attention was found by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been involved in central registers at national level, who really stands behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill of Parliament in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this vast insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure in the US and globally for greater transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are furious when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlines.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy that arise and say, "Intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use themselves to end by laws this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally ending this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost abducted and in the trunk of a red Mazdas would be landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my opinion.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made just a road trip to the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me thrilled how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says he would go to peace-ps, but I don't know if he is really planning. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small car boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard say: "I have an air-wearing. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Can, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what happened to me here?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildcard sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I stepped out of the bed, at Zehenikes to the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he bought from me is on the classroom today. he is a teacher now.</seg>
<seg id="120">It was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewing angles.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends who were waiting for you to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air rakes was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air rakes.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, nearly plea, my fellow occupant attracts, and the rent will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can do it to turn fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new Mitbewohner Brian Chesky: "Brian, I was thinking about how we could earn something. our apartment will stay for a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and started so "air rakes and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air wooden floor on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham-omelettes are completely different, because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all the city. when we were welcomed our last guest and the door to the castle, Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and could pay for our rental?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blepotczyk, decided to join us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We would find out whether you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented our investors: "we want to create a site where people publicly posts from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms which includes doors if you come past.</seg>
<seg id="139">Via the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited, that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did not do it.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still very consolation, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because, as children all have learned that foreign lands are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you will discuss the things you can. we have designed out.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than look and haptic -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create confidence by design immick confidence between men who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do so anything?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with Design Confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a taste, which degree trust we request.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet pickup of panic that you can sense now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing, what is personal as your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the barrier of a strange woman in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">You will also feel the most guests to stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once, who is actually Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell us on Twitter that he dictates the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced now what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced with his name; if he had told how he comes from, how his dog or his children are promised?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 convictions that all say: "he can really unlock out cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-known feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative convictions.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait for both hosts and guest appearances, before we presented them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We carried out with Stanford for a study. we investigated how likely it is that people depend on each other how much they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Surprisingly, we trust the people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of view similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">Thus, the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted ambassadors.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you are reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">When you tell too little, like "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">You tell too much, as for example: "I have problems with my mother -- -- -- will the request also not be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "handsome art pieces in your apartment! I make holidays with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create this degree to openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on what topics it should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company is based on hope that the right design can help, overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we did not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than willing to disclose this prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need to have been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, business is going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are unallowed parties, or homes have been ravaged.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts will leave guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood on the front, when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it's hurt, if I just remember.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which was heard in the voice of the callers, was, and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction had ever had a problem of 123 millions.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people confided in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence is working, there can be wonderful curiosities.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even raised blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, who tend to attack heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The neighborhood is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel, who save one life, even though they don't know it at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they are passing books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay a longer stay without charging the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I recommend it highly! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay will go.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transactions are exactly what you want to reach with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled on this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of participating with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's all about a economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But we just call it "rental industry," the thing is not just to do.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade in human relations.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put out a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you fall today it is to be compared with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would, however, if traveling a rich buffet would be from local revenue?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in every place you visit, a group there would wait to fill a group there and to show a bar for the bar, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you want to cook from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are arranged according to the privacy principle.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments for reason?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities were supposed to have the thought of common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow ourselves to society and relations, instead of loneliness and scotation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea, the project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the Government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Now people were offered. students that were looking for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were facilitated by people whose children were out, Incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to fund new start-ups in the Share economy, there are 785 000 people in 191 countries with a foreigner or even hosts in 191 countries.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to not be so crazy about how it was taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has also been there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites to us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that we can find the right design with the parts of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design may help us to overcome profound prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it, if a red Mazda goes on me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for the future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, underunderwear a counter-underwear, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in safety at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">That is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So, the media represent it, which look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study indicated that 80% of the reporting is negative about Islam and Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people don't talk to their competitors.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslims: it is great to identify you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double Espresso, with whipped cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A cturnal Fitness-fanatikerin</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga singing, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to join this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 I met the decision to ousted.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends but as the Muslim. I decided to bear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist independent declaration of independence, with the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old felt to watch me a perfect and unatable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively received the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have Conclusions with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read him, thought, posed in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened themselves with every reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm is sometimes brought me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone takes you to complete you completely, and somehow he loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began how all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineers.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later on, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the Egyptian American dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">As smoke, aircraft flew into buildings, people sparrows out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock has changed quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the channel and heard:... "Muslim" terrorists "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It was not only my country, but in the Nu turned me the deeds of others from a citizen in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the middle west of the USA to move into a new city and begin to graduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I drove him -- as deep as we went into my seat, and I was afraid for the first time, as the Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new town where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, when I heard, I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said, "Be vigilant," "be careful," "unleashed in well lit places," "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day that Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings had said: "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw my extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandable, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or men, which they held for Muslims, taken into the free-breaking and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really branding on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something was not felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people, who had attacked this country, attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I tried to get the rage of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy, constantly to explain.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in that country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malicious tumor is removed as a whole, and a benign tumor is only observing under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, gifts and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques United States be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">Maybe there will be a few parking spaces, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visits to a mosque is leading to people of other faith tolerate, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radical process, it was found that he starts online. as a result, the person is separated from their church, even from their family so that the extremes of their family believes that the terrorists be the true Muslims, and everyone who discarded their behavior and ideology is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some of them are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group of IS establishes its breeding ality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, a mother, as a person, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to add to their imagination, if you recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But when you throw a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">A remarkable Imam told me recently an amazing history:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she had preceded to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy, with whom she had spoken, brought her silence and told her that her anger, her mind for injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspires and something that would make sense of their anger, she was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists that made a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam introduced the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than accuse them for their anger, he demonstrated its constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight, like Islamophobia and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect the normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- basically several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather a authoritarian governmental system, conformity, and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if one reported testing individuals in which negative over Muslims has been reported, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look, when the mood against Muslims left up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It may actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to liberate the foundations of a free society, reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims are a early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We feel it perhaps as first, but the toxic air of fear causes us to all.</seg>
<seg id="368">With the assignment of collective debt, it is not only about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did the young man have become a diversified young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after visiting Suzanne's visit to her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who was in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as he posted a statement against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be morally, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or stayed at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision, because it was because we would like to leave our children to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we drove silence, with high pressure towards the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes came out, and went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, stopped me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathered Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers, who had come to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment, I have broken.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage, compassion, and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to go on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you will connect to those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks a lot!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say that you are saying that you're holding a TEDTalk, a thinking with deep-pass, that is an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say don't fool you. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception to this.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so ordinary as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at the Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest in the study of Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am an exception in any regard.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people appear as an exception, then the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Bastler, a billionaire line is about to become a billionaire line.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for professional drones. possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-petting started in our social consciousness, autonomous fleet of air machines at the Frac Centre in France were built live in front of an audience six meters high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Through interlocking devices, high speed and acceleration reached in tight spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-bearing structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, to deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility within the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to make a system autonomous, it must be collective to know where the mobile objects are located in the space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory on the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board, what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available on top floors, e.g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear-starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">An aircraft that tries to beat two flies with one flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starting-wings it can hover, and it has great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a flip side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starfish is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device is capable of relegating the optimum position and improves performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often provide basic abstract questions, which causes the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be, for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about as machines with a thousand moving parts that accumulate you to injure you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, we managed to fly remote-controlled flying equipment that had only two moving parts: one propeller and a rear rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Far, we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simulated flight machine. it was invented in front of short.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and Querrudes, no further actuators or control surfaces, just one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, in the inner life much, so that it can fly stable, and move in space over.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nonetheless, it does not have the elegant Algorithm of the rear side. to get it to fly, I must throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability to throw it exactly when I all see is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is an exercise in pleasures, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the greater ability to offer,</seg>
<seg id="447">In space in all directions, no matter what direction it is shot, or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Naturally it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is darker in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that on.</seg>
<seg id="451">When air machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate twin-propeller aircraft machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build it together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- can move the machine further if also restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this, as we do half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic sheds.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took usual Micro-Quadcopter - each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and outfit them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where space is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think out of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine because you would like to fly a flying lamp on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the reward is in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe, and that it allows creative, smart heads to form them in so spectacular ways.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, is the tittle of the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">More than 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes in a very far distant galaxies becomes faster, they turned the mass of three suns in a tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they lightened brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole famous universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very great creall.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy they were not free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">And finally we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given in the space time-feeling and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Almost 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God arise - even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Approximately 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss recently decided to build a huge laser detector from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colonizing black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most stopped them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as crazy genies, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: laser interferometer Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo increased significantly, which improved recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore we call him Advanced Ligo now.</seg>
<seg id="484">Early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collizing black holes passed through the ground.</seg>
<seg id="486">They walked through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector through.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this what I had worked for, is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT. he has been studied gravitational waves from black holes and their through obstructions like Ligo measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a crusement in the feeling of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When overcrossing the shaft, the space and its entire content will be stretched in one direction and put it into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Illustrative cures in courses for relativity theory often perform a really albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and duck, stretch and duck."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely low, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, every one of us was deposed and sticking by us at the meeting of the waves. the elongation of an average human was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma followed by one 1. therefore, one declared the Ligo staff to go crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear failure. that's grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text over Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt for the waves, follows: "the technical difficulties when constructing such detectors are vast.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are finderful and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims to be Ligo's more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what that meant.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so you can make a picture or map of things, by perceiving that of several points coming to you around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones, that is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean especially much:</seg>
<seg id="512">To the child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as sound and pitch, rhythm, and volume to close on the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"right now says Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob is interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least there are the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">When we convert wave pattern to sound, we can hear that literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation, too, can betray us about the collision of two black holes, referring to my colleague Scott already very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-turning holes, circulates simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you can hear the same clamps with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion detector, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that I must never forget -- heard the sound of Someone, knows what he must hear, this sound as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-speed mass mass, which rotate approximately as fast as the bars of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: do we have to think about what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as they never had ever been possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all, we can not see -- practical or basically -- not seen.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massager stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of these, we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The antalizing physical processes occur at the core, which lies behind thousands of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves are penetrating iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the Urscaris: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Urscarf is hidden by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly: I am optimistic that we don't have seen in all things we never seen, which we will never see, and of which we have no idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">Indeed, Ligo found the first run of things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague is MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this theme: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the suction cups for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo enables us to view a totally different perspective on the events of all, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we were coming out of this mayhem.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be so courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the cosmos of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of observatories on earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For a year, I would say to everything "Yes!" I was afraid of that.</seg>
<seg id="556">Regardless of whether it made me nervous, brought me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Do I want to be live in television?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to begin with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: that's what I was afraid of, my fear terrified.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, to keep words, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life, unexpectedly. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all "skittens,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kitten, I need milk for my beak cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked her once, whether I could play with her, when I was just at the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">Yes, this is the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">There was a new life setting in my family. from there I wasted to play with them whenever you do me. no matter what I'm doing, or whither I'm going, I always say Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I strive to strive.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my kids, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazingly low effect: it was just a short time ago, that "Yes" - Sagen to play my career with my children.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think of things, awaking up for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I'm producing television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make TV, in a big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">I am responsible for this TV-season to spend 70 hours of schedule in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">Another episode has nine days of TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programs, which are simultaneously in production, mal four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series run one another on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created itself, and not only produced, so still obtrucking. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans for camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who this is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, that all of you who are working so hard, whether you're a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a classroom, so that you can understand that I don't just walk around your computer and I say, I understand that it doesn't dream about dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, everything blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepening into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I introduced troops, I painted on a screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as a single sound, one will find a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, clinically and maternal, clinically and maternal, fierce and sensible. and the best part is that sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There's so a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sum starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums listens to a busy street, I could go for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that I explain the sums that I speak, that the writing will be writing to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I started working with television production when I began working and working and working, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">It is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sum, you cannot strive different than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">Feeling, not different to strive than to strive for, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workouts.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps there is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to ask it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: the more successful I will, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work more, the more I am writing, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, aren't I?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I create, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overtaken, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that their mum is a only working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "Oh, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are a baby-titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I just loved my job anymore. the engine was out of course.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sum was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, continuous weekend, no remorse, no reunion, a titanium sleeps, does not give up, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was an indication-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So, what do you do when doing what you're doing, the work you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know some may think: "locust yourself," the author of the author of Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you're doing it, you are working to be a banker, a banker, a mother who knows how the sums feels, and know how the sums does not know when the sums stops if the sums stops, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When I hear the song of my heart, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "South-States-Kellner" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I'm on the way out there, late and she says: "mom, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no more than I would be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, they don't called me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "shame."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan bin and my Summon. here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And this is what she says: "mom, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and play their sisters, we laugh so much and I'm reading quite dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the spring, I can't do anything but to fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I create, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists, sticky fingers and humid shots, tender voices, wax stipens and the song, in which it goes about, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Age" is extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air on this place is so short that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I'm happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door is coming up and an energy boost is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working sums, the titanium box, that is only the substitute.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I am managing to using Shows and TV hours, and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not strength and it is not-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The true sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river, which comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The true sums is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The true sums ignores the pressure of the story that are experiencing tasks, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The true sum of God is God's voice in my ear, but might you whispered God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, a lot more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this for a regular rule, so that I can free myself as workavers from each guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's a law, I have no choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to listen to Summon.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in games, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">You do not play a whopping, like working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, for what man is working rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too sensitive, none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We shave around in the garden, back and back, round and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make little dance-parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly with stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always travel to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how you are living, and the sums of the universe fulfills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! let's say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you've got me for naive, for a daydream woman.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you do good, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet-Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes with me until they want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">They are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or Ceks replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my teen-daughter speaks for 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more need it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each one can lift every 15 minutes, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children wish to bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellbeing, my world. it must not be the children. it applies to feel the sums to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with their own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Indulge in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I won victories. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show, when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to excel myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes per piece, why don't you indulge in 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a couple of months, a door opens up and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melodic, it fills me and my soul. it seduces me to new ideas. that sums up, I use it in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That is now my Summon.</seg>
<seg id="775">That sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just one part. I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is my lip that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in handle. my brain is still working. my camp fire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country, which I create, the marathon which I run, the troops, the screens, the sums, the sums, the other, the right sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more it makes this unusual, sinning, naked and new feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer. I think of things, I awaken about life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dream.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to have less work and too more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I'm Neurosurgical I.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the others, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neurosurgeon is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very small ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgical surgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve function by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">For sure they have heard of one of the most well-known, the "deep brain stimulation." it implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to affect the circuits of neurons that improves neurological function.</seg>
<seg id="805">It's truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that had heavy tremor and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-Healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we are approaching this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a leader and worked day and night in the notebook.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain-brain traumata would infeed the brain and inclined to the skull pressure on the skull.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one needs to diminish the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of a weakened brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Rather than to throw away brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells of a tissue remains, comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">It is necessary to find the correct diet, temperature, humidity, and environments to thrive it.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with big green cells surrounded by small, unrimature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know of the biology classes that stem cells are unmature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did another fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They sat slowly and after a couple of weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">Thus we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but it was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand what they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublectic-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the foetus, they take care of the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they getting us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of brain, since we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however, of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cellular source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to deduct a piece of brain mass from unlinguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And afterwards, to mark them in color, to pursue them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted them at the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation - car transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplanted these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we repimplanted the same cells in the cerebral tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely disappeared after several weeks, they go back home. the room is already occupied but they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we tested a violation and implantable exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help monkeys to recover from a cerebral injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual job task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take animal pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill level, we injured motorized cortex for the motorized cortisation area.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in people, they respawn spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover using plastic brainism. it recovering to a certain degree, just like in the apes.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degrees of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey, which collected spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance in the case of injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturation transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we found very much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example, in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely fall.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human subjects.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results you have to fill two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through these kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: looking into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to see permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can arrive to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then one must perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to choose the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Afterwards one must apply it to a multi-center study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the West, we are making a great mistake to consider them as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy, not as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as the inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable ear.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism is inevitably leading democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing have undoubtedly proved that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy is overcome with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my friends who would repeat that democracy would be abolished when they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economical model for a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I beg you to believe together with me again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Without democracy, our societies are in common, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">Regarding waste, I would like to point you at an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our tavern.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-summit-paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">One summit is known to you. you know and recognise it as the debt-mountain, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the debt-mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is heard that are anxious to invest, but it may be productive and income, with which one could produce the debt-life and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in the United States, in all the prosperity of producing goods such as industrial facilities, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollars sounds after a lot of money until it compares with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars, which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing happens, except for stock exchanges and real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debt and unproductive capital represent the twin summit which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the U.S., Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low demand for investors who could not invest in which they are not investing in which it would be true that his son would kill him if he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally, the circumstances leads, that causes it to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my sharks with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely lavish art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and to finance them all the technologies, "green" technologies that are key to rescue the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So, democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society, in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy has, of course, too many!</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to minate the focus of the Athenian democracy.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision of the athenian democracy was, and is that they were deprived of the working poor, but not only the right to free expression of expression, but more importantly and decisive, they had the right to agree to political participation with the same moods in question of state power.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept long though --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very light, it is burned too quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies don't have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, who ultimately became a statute for controlling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy was only possible when a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was observed in politics, while the economy - so the world of corporations - was a democratically-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time when the separation of politics and economy began, an inexorable battle between the two, while the economy gradually joined the policy and dismayed them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer so old as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not part of a degeneration of DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is obvious that one can still be in the government but not in power, because the power of politics came down into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that feeds on so sustainably the animals, of which they feed, decimated so that at the end it is starving.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that the policy has so far decreased by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations grows, political goods are assessed and the overall economic demand is falling and the managing director of companies are anxious to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism distributes the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the welfare of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we need to bring together the policies and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, like in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">That is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The law from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is only repeated by a miracle as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it, replacing low-gloom employed by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that as long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation is higher than the twin-level, and the social conflicts is deeper, as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must reshape the economy and unite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratise the reunified area, otherwise we will be appearing in a disease monitoring hyperdrive which lets the film "Matrix" as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question isn't, whether capitalism has the technical achievements, which he has produced, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, resembles the society in "Star Trek," in which machines are serving to serve human energy in the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks to the sense of life indulge.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would you need to look like this "Star Trek" like "Star Trek" instead of the "Matrix" like a dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: ask yourself a capital market prior to which you are working and in which your capital will follow you from a workstation to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues from capital and from redeeming and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">There are no distinction no distinction between those who are part of the company, and employees who work there but not belongs to those who are not part of capital and work, no large gaps between investment and austerity and ultimately no emporal twin-climbs.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: please indicate that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging markets], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is traded - we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" -- and every government pays the sum which equates to the trade deficit or the country's trading process, into a mutual funds.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment is rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, in particular, we have them, especially in the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe, is at the same time liberating in which she favored individuals, and marxistic because they have buried the separation of capital and work in trash of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Become a waking up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "Matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we choose to politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertorial Marxist in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything about what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do we do not do this, the technological development create a massive decline in overall economic demand, which means Larry Summers as a "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also countries whose interest is minimal in liberal democracy.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, therefore I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a sort of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said this. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the speakers of the speakers we have clearly said what you think about the view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there's a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the vision of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on politics while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of the economy -- a completely Christian-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, if I may say this as provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- Do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China now, quite similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now taking action to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells amazing to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginnings with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, we say goodbye to the self-notes, and the continuing denial that a massive reduction line through the Eurozone, and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity on the basis of Greek premondays -- by the way, the first suggestion was to deny this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">To make it right. unfortunately, the forces within the eurozone, within the European group, continues to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to obtain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and Authoritarianism, you may not hesitate for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: which change will you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone won't have any future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any mistakes in your time as finance ministers?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously juice...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who is in office after 6 months, especially in a so-called situation, he did not make mistakes, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course, I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to submit an application for the extension of the cancellation program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I thought there was an honest interest in pages of the investors, to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But it didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring down our government, only because they did not want to deal with the tests done by the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not necessarily wanted to pass through a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika's Troika, imposed on us this policy, was stressed: "that was a coloscopic mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive watch of talks, you seem to be quite right one-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My critique of the European Union and the Eurozone is confronted by someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone was not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if she does not survive, the released murderer shall be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have been catastrophic consequences for Europe, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we recessed ourselves to the path of a post-modern 1930, when it appears to me, it will also be unbearable to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you so much that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">From Roy Price most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior manager at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, and she describes herself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for producing shows and content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard driving sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy not able to choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series at the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows have given this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">They are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that you have looked addicted after a season, your brain asks, "Where is there more of those episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">That kind of Show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here in this end, shows shows like "Toddlers and tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, because I think you need a special intelligence in order to accommodate "Toddlers and tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle reculsion, the average TV -- the shows that are not good nor bad, they are simply not enthuse.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing so something, that's why Roy Price wants to risk free.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes lots of ideas for TV shows and chooses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, and then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives out free of things, you can get right, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are looking at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are watched when watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture, when you start the show, when you pausing, which parts you start or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data, in order to decide which show you should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process this and this makes the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make Sitcom about four Republican senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that many people cannot remember this show, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show - in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Approximately at the same time with another company has plazed another manager with data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for finding this a Super show and he also uses data for it, but he does it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of running a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows them, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewer: what shows they like what producers, what actors do.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had gathered all the pieces together, they went to a car and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data sealed.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says that things should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You Optimize it with very high-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindeste you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working so, this is something shockingly because we live in a time in which we can take more and more statistics to make serious choices, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-health system is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with this software, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison in the United States and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of the company is used to determine if a dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like with Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. that's not that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data irreversible firms are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that through data analysis explosions of flu, the worse species, predict -- through data analysis of Google's research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news location. success culminated in a release in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year around year, until it suddenly wasn't working anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It was simply not working, it was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data irreversible firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all this faults, data immersed in the decisions of life - at the workplace, by the law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics - an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I detected some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, you disassemble this problem in its parts so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place you put together the items in order to receive a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and packed again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just fine for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put together the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool, and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, there are parts and pieces to put together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to receive a good decision -- especially if the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, why they were otherwise unable to understand. but the decision to make all these parts, together and make it a show like the House of Cards, "does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they left a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">By contrast, Amazon did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV ideas, then they chose an "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they always could say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices, but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to forget it not, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before data existed, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many do know them.</seg>
<seg id="1130">There is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No doubt you only need to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- exact here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll get it later with a demo demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some choices in my life, with what I should have heard in the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated, like data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the principle.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball is smarter and smarter. ultimately, it is on us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data still disbursed to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing and risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, it is not the data but the risks involved with which you are landing at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
