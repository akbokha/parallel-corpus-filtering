Munich 1856 : four cards that change your glance into the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where you@@ ths should meet today .
a Gru@@ ber chapel , where it is dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ dener farms the former reason of peasants .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ ch promotes exciting stories for days .
it &apos;s annoying if maps are not currently available .
it knows anyone who had to introduce themselves , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green meadow instead of a ring road .
the historic maps of the digital Bayern atl@@ ases , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria in the state government , are all other than currently - yet very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
it is then clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich Mercury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a patch carpet , which one cannot recognize as such .
in the great overview map , for cities and municipalities in detailed maps , so @-@ called primary leaves , were min@@ ed .
these emerged , according to the Bavarian Sur@@ veying rule between 1810 and 1864 , and leap of the first sur@@ veying in Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French armies occupied Bavaria since the end of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns - of course , of course , for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops returned with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville in February 9 , 1801 , the present neighbours who created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bavaria map .
Kur@@ für@@ st@@ Max IV Joseph continued the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Authority management .
the Ur@@ z@@ s@@ blatt for Munich is written in 1856 and is how many others can be found on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the early morning / today is the most impressive example of the country &apos;s capital .
the town has expanded into all directions , and has grown .
an example of this is ste@@ el@@ ling , relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , in 1877 , the Munich district .
the ou@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of the houses were concentrated in 1856 along the today &apos;s pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bavarian farmers in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West Park , one sees anything as an fields - at first sight : in the zo@@ oming appears a small @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered fl@@ ur@@ fs from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ absorption , &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
there are no farmers still present there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the complex &quot; land in sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of the ou@@ tra@@ ling .
Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 on the scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was actually a meadow , and not a concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of the district of the district of the district of the district Au @-@ Ha@@ id@@ hausen , not just read the street name &quot; at Gast@@ eig , &quot; or from the An@@ ger &quot; on the ventilation , &quot; but also in great letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field street they once locked out people with guards .
there , in 1858 / 59 the Munich @-@ Irish district of Munich was created at the Au@@ er ventilation . &quot;
in 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den presi@@ ded the facility - that psychiat@@ rist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the purchase of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
in addition , he prohibited the staff to contact violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Ha@@ id@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
initially , 280 patients had been accommod@@ ated . he was later extended to 500 places .
sometime this capacity also wasn &apos;t enough - the reason for construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ anstalt in the hair of 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist .
at the area of the former au@@ er institutions , young people meet in Munich Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training .
West is the football field of TS@@ V Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; built in its architectural operator against the cultivation of the Ir@@ rig@@ th , which was destroyed during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 1856 as &quot; main square , &quot; the commercial street called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a crucial change carried out the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the Allies landed a lot of holes in the downtown area in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ ist from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof during this day , where these days the pre @-@ work and on April 5 , 2017 , the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich decided to take place for the second S @-@ Bahn station .
compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole on Mari@@ enhof with an aerial photograph .
civil Legal Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
the National Union for promoting Far@@ ming has issued a warning for colored people who , due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attack of the State to Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board of the Federal State of Missouri , which will enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to attract special attention by the State , as a number of un@@ question@@ able , racial accidents in recent times will occur and here , &quot; is said in the opinion of the Group .
a recently adopted law of Missouri , which makes people harder to gain discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , the disp@@ ro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate to min@@ orities , promp@@ ted the group to release the war@@ nings , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have injuries of civil rights that happen to humans .
they are stopped due to their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited events such as rac@@ ist verses of black student at the University of Missouri and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri , without being accused of crime .
the Council also shows a recent report from the Office of the Missouri Office in which it is shown that black drivers are often observed in the state 75 percent more frequently than white .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are conscious of themselves and their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; says Chapel .
&quot; people must be ready to bring along with the money or their relatives , that they travel through the state . &quot;
Missouri posted 100 Hass@@ elt in 2015 , following the latest figures from the hate @-@ crime report of the FBI , who steps the state in terms of number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country .
the it@@ iner@@ ary is also a response to a new Missouri Act which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for residential or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) published their travel warning for Texas and Arizona since the United States of immigration authorities were committed to negoti@@ ate people because of mig@@ rant workers , which is to contribute to other racial abuse .
travel bud@@ dies are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but l@@ ately , stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
incense project is elem@@ ental
the her@@ b@@ ail@@ fence m@@ fence project is a success project and is continued in the coming year .
the CDU parliament members Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac were built on site a picture .
in the arch@@ eological area of the swi@@ vel family , representatives of the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher CDU local area met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two ME@@ Ps .
Markus Schwen@@ n@@ demann still besto@@ ws insights into his farm in which he cultiv@@ ates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and as many young animals and houses in five apartments .
black wal@@ nut milk &quot; is the alternative solution for the milk of its cows , so swi@@ vel .
on the table of the agriturismo is only regional .
since he is also BL@@ HV @-@ chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he described the electric fence as &quot; elem@@ ental . &quot;
I can &apos;t generate on der@@ lands steep surfaces .
the green space care for a lot of work , much must be processed with the engine sense .
&quot; we have shown here with the conditions and top@@ ography &quot; , &quot; Schwen@@ n@@ demann .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ eventh operation and cultiv@@ ate these without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it does not lead a bio@@ operation .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of its dec@@ ember project and is happy with the Leader of the Leader . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the request of the land could still be pulled out for a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; stressed the may@@ ors .
farmers are often present in the criticism
over the electric fence in 2013 , over 25 plots of eleven nations were fenced in 2013 .
the open surface area is thus 40 hectares , which can not be for@@ ged to at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of € 71 million , half of the leader was funded by the leader of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
thus , the farmers came to invest 12 610 , who had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; explained swi@@ vel .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a really good job without farmers and farm women . &quot;
also for Peter White , the best food is produced here . &quot;
the govern@@ ement directives ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg will enable the state support of incense .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the presence is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r con@@ veying system .
in addition , the fenced area must not be far@@ med ( Hang@@ ing over 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the request .
in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .
the dis@@ closure of the event is 35 hectares , the calculate costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes on the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is , if they start to attack the statues .
Americans estimate this as well as any other - so the car@@ c@@ ased down@@ fall Saddam Hussein &apos;s place to the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic A@@ ax@@ e in a heated war with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CNN , which took the president &apos;s dra@@ stic limitation with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller doesn &apos;t handle the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of boat cru@@ st@@ rels and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have pl@@ agu@@ ed him if he had done it .
but he touched their meaning , and in particular the importance that you were attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base has been added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ains : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an icon of American freedom that en@@ light@@ ens the world .
the poem , which you refer to , was added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively properly , but as he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance of Lazarus , the only one , in which a state not only invites any old immig@@ rant , but the arms of the poor : &quot; your pain@@ s , your poor , and your oppressed masses , that afterward desire to breathe freely , / the apost@@ asy of your wealthy coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ eventh apost@@ asy &quot; was better on our screens .
Miller is not committed to literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who made themselves to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they completed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans , portra@@ ying the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom in a worn classical picture .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has got a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of Ex@@ ac@@ ants .
the connection with the image is a brilliant feminine cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vism .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change this long way from the right wing .
the great Schrei@@ er Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed that the Statue of Liberty is not included , but rather an early Ne@@ oc@@ on@@ ite that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proce@@ eding .
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not supposed to shine the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh found here on something .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of perception .
the great triumph of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ ending , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible vo@@ y@@ ages on the deck of ships .
it &apos;s in the true sense , to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome , which they must hear .
and that of course not the perspective , which would ever want to recognize Miller and Tr@@ ump .
their tor@@ ch shall not g@@ low the way , but hatred , who is the only source of power , is kind@@ led .
world Championships 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish Members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle is reminis@@ cent of a time when only two Sc@@ ots have belonged to the UK team .
the scope of performance of the ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent will be a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes in Scotland is something special developed &quot; and the ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will pass it until we &apos;ll find it , &quot; black .
&quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish ath@@ lete think that something has to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected to team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
their cap@@ tains @-@ speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ dh bl@@ ended totally of course were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ Silver medal winner , who will compete in its fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which was reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the R@@ ir center stretches along this way and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will be participating at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another Scot@@ sman which one would look for a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is reminis@@ cent of her first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was on Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the Mann@@ er chapters that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots not only belong to the team but in some cases also at the medals and at the Fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about team chapters is to be that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; added them .
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb up to Po@@ ships .
what concerns my speech as a capitalist ?
yes , I think it went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
it &apos;s really important to use this home support and to benefit from it that we are in the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and simply will be such a great atmosphere because outside . &quot;
block from critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you don &apos;t want to heat the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspaper beat him because of all , from the in@@ policy up to its political principles .
he sc@@ ents with the cr@@ iti@@ que , certainly .
but he did not put his critics into silence .
as in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and m@@ ute , we are led like sheep for battles . &quot;
it brings me to Maryland Larry H@@ og@@ an who must work on it to be more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees are blocking the contributions of at least 450 persons and vo@@ iced their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained about this week at the beginning of this week .
the governor of the governor dismissed the claim as free@@ v@@ ol , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; there is only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when a type like H@@ og@@ an is .
this is a republi@@ can governor in a stunning democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest approval of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary head @-@ head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with its voters and made his hair @-@ loose head following chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons appearing on the page of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially declared as officially and of employees who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessarily , and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans spokesperson on Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse argu@@ ed the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of tro@@ ug@@ gle or chambers or h@@ ass@@ alle people who sw@@ inging the whi@@ p .
the Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments respec@@ t@@ fully , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ a Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi &apos;s Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD , was not h@@ ass@@ able , but she asked to hate them .
&quot; I said that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current messages , &quot; she wrote in the commentary volume &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people are on the same subject , then they are ab@@ used by some more than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the employees of the governor as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would probably call others &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or neg@@ atively deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous periods , if one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical conduc@@ ts and bring to silence or demonstr@@ ators to silence .
but exactly this happens very digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials that critic@@ ises this , that he has p@@ enn@@ ed Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County promised the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Mar@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use on Facebook and Twitter .
that should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington the time of affordable p@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of papers were varied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous correspon@@ dent did beat on his guidance .
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
the people who p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all the letters of newspapers that make Washington &apos;s decisions .
pet@@ itions that critic@@ ised his position on the contract of Am@@ ity , trade , and shipping by the United Kingdom , will overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to the historical documents gathered by the George Washington Project online papers .
but he did not put her into silence .
freedom of Expression , Outlook and Dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true guidance means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
former European man , no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty , will hope for the next three days that the Renaissance club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led last year on the Arch@@ er@@ field links to the final round before he lost against Paul E@@ ating , is tied to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founding founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches its fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition .
Jerry made a great job as he set up this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of its performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player headquartered in South@@ port .
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , as they had won it in the year after I got them out of the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories came back last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who returned to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to the event .
this event will be the first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more if you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to make it good , but you also sense this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how it &apos;s gone so far . &quot;
with the trio in the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Champion Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ish .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
the entrance is free of charge , the parking costs £ 5 a car with a production and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .

less lung cancer by passive smoking
fewer people have died because of the passive smoking of lung cancer in the past two decades .
these results are scientists at the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 cases of lung cancer cases were due on passive smoking , &quot; said study leader Hei@@ ko Becher .
in comparison , he drew a private study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time there were 400 lung cancer cases because of passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic inclu@@ sions be considered very complex
construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are reas@@ onably sized , &quot; says the director of the court Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is plenty of se@@ amounts in the Underground , which is not indicated in the plans .
the traffic , which has always been handic@@ apped again , represents a large problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of the motor@@ ists before red lights and lock@@ ers is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed , and only the liner buses be eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z , from the company St@@ ump@@ p , has been busy with working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were quite wonderful .
but fortunately we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with precious mineral water , &quot; tells Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i co@@ oks the dinner , they do not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in their wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the in@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua New Zealand , the house@@ wife normally den@@ oted a sweet potato - locally referred to as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the plast@@ ered dum@@ pl@@ ank is taken , un@@ washed , un@@ washed hands and swallowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where she also conduc@@ ts her daily work , e.g. clothes with dec@@ ep@@ tive water from the nearby sin@@ ks .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of their husband , their fields were assigned .
Poly@@ gam@@ y is usual here .
of course , late to work is dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; nobody wants to walk around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the hig@@ hlands of Papua New Zealand , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following an controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders should vote before the occupying forces .
a existing movement , which touched the independence of Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , where the control of the region maintains and foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua New Guinea without the independent part of Papua New Guinea to the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as ab@@ duc@@ ted as it &apos;s desert . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by b@@ ambo@@ o @-@ trees , and from corrugated cardboard ro@@ ofs , which were transformed by rust in various gel@@ b@@ ish tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , rep@@ lied because journalists and practically no fore@@ igner .
before Christian mission@@ aries came , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .

Papua New Zealand &apos;s poo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst children of children and liter@@ acy rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable Gold@@ mine in the world , gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high landing province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has min@@ ed $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Papua New Guinea belonged to an estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for Papua New Guinea that ensure that Indonesia is preser@@ ving the presence of Indonesia .
a survey conducted in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military unit and units paid almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 U.S. dollars to a single officer .
pap@@ al recei@@ v@@ ables after much autonomy thre@@ aten these golden age and are treated with mer@@ cil@@ essly .
data from activists have been killed more than 500,000 troops and thousands of thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indonesian military , tortured and imprisoned .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ es@@ land in the 1970 @-@ 1970s have been appointed to commit genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year alone in the region alone .
&quot; we Are Everything Se@@ aling , &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane , which are included in the reports about the previous year &apos;s report , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture ; rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precipitation of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims because every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ Resear@@ cher for Human Rights Watch .
bolts have reinforced since Pap@@ u@@ as will bring a state of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes due to the Muslim economy of the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

&quot; we began to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua New market , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai natives , who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it was the native Papua New Mor@@ mon , the Mama @-@ M@@ om &#91; the Women &#93; of Papua New Guinea . &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the crowds and as Jok@@ o@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and legal injuries in Papua New Zealand in 2014 .
the ex @-@ carp@@ enter took 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua New Guinea , including pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua New Zealand changed little , and today the locals are che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ov@@ i , with expect@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep spot after Jok@@ ov@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols down on a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two indones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took an impulse to their tone and came later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , were hunting , and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers burned into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
they wore cr@@ on@@ ical hun@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuous and a bird @-@ singing im@@ iti@@ y - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to@@ wing stones on police and military posts .
when the mood has been heated , a command was sent over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official document of TIM@@ E that has not been de@@ classified by local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ quarters of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ oping danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot into my left hand , &quot; he said TIM@@ E at the porch of his colorful wooden house .
kay@@ aking still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of this soldiers .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his cousin , who was the witness of the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and tested his body to be sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only carries a name , the TIM@@ E in dark atmosphere .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor of the Papua New police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to ins@@ ure their station to &quot; ins@@ ure , &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua New police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ers were killed and many others injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings arrived just on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
in three weeks , Jok@@ ov@@ i kept a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura for a passionate talk in which he utter@@ ed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ ware , the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua New Guinea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , he was said that he establishes a special mechanism for sett@@ ling historic human rights violations .
but the talking started almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred long ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 &quot; s and early the 2000 years .
the point is that we have obliged to tackle these violations , but there are processes that have to run through . &quot; he said .
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke with TIM@@ E on June 5th in Jak@@ arta and said he did not have plans to establish a complaint in Papua New Guinea .
instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , whom the UN has indicted for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in East Timor have requested that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua New Guinea were already enclosed , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to those alleg@@ ations related to influenza .
&quot; I inter@@ viewed four times during the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he is still in fear of years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten up by the military , after he helped destroy four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military was looking for me , &quot; he says .
the sh@@ ot@@ ies have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police attacked the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 year old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
regular vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers , who acted on them by firing them warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary forces ) began shooting and killing one killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here has been delivered quickly so the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to withdraw the involved officers and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police in the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ stove for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family @-@ affiliated Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ land of Papua New Guinea .
many of the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claims to defend the rights of Papua New Zealand by spor@@ adi@@ se attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to the recent years thousands of people were arrested and arbitr@@ arily detained in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding &quot; national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua New Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty provides the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields in the sweet potato .
you will retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a tasted only 10,000 indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ quality between the indigenous communities and the new migrants have grown , which since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire have arrived in larger numbers .
the few jobs that exist in the region are usually to the better trained and prosp@@ erous migrants .
Papua New Guinea rarely depri@@ ved capital , or the necessary skills in order to competitive their own business .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua New .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media are ex@@ iled .
at the beginning of the year , French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua New institutions , although the rare permission was given to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov@@ is election campaign , the restrictions on reporting to raise transparency and development , are not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attemp@@ ting to report from Indonesia &apos;s in@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua New Guinea and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
the lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pa@@ zi@@ l states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ as and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua New Guinea .
the same countries have historically been supported by O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to exercise the evidence of human rights . &quot;
the people on site would like more foreign governments to acknowledge this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the guidance of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting but anonymous .
Indonesia lost another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua New Guinea that they probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a man who has good int@@ entions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants the fact that Jok@@ ov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ people , aside from that it lives under the constant threat of a religious military , is located in poor educational and health services .
G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ people , like other Papua New Guinea , consider their voice to Jok@@ o@@ i as an &quot; guilt &quot; that he must rep@@ ay .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation families , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tr@@ uss@@ ars resulted in a final symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the bodies of a victim was buried on a ground opposite the police and the military station .
they know that maybe righteousness will never be coming , but at least it does not forget the persons responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his heads .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire cap@@ turing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to second time
a fire place on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps into the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is called the tor@@ ch @-@ tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , bre@@ aches were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the scre@@ ams of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor facing down , &quot; said a resident that was named George Ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais &apos;s civilian authorities said that the units of fire ab@@ at@@ ement at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said they work in providing accommodation for the suff@@ erers .
the incident may be used for safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its burning in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from the disgu@@ ise , the exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or isolation came .
in Great Britain , the police , she said that the system of plates to isolation and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June might have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that died around 80 people .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through the General Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup @-@ single can only be played on two winning sets , non @-@ thin@@ ly supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
the most often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classics remain the traditional do so .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states agreed to reform the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ g@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire core package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
one will continue to work on improving the competitors .
not only for the vote , after the vote , the final on a neutral place was added to the vote .
new starting in 2018 are just compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will soon be the host @-@ right next round in the next round .
to reduce the cost of the organizers , the requirements are facil@@ itated on training places , etc . , and players will have to complete the official media event before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US passengers bring forbidden objects into the plane , find out a survey
a survey of flight passengers showed that more than 20 percent consci@@ ously were aware of or un@@ consci@@ ously connected objects to the controls of US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent , which entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally contributed knives or other items associated with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had been delayed , they had to be ir@@ r@@ able with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey was conducted at more than 1,000 persons - who was carried out by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ ry , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that the younger trav@@ ellers did rather desp@@ ise their rules .
of the respondents , the admitted that they have attempted to fly with something that was forbidden from the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , which were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately urged to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent stated that they have carried by security control by security control while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they were deliberately brought drugs into the plane .
the company said it was inter@@ ro@@ gated in all country to find out how many acci@@ dentally believed sm@@ ug@@ gling from the airport safety and how many it would have been deliberately done .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely to wear sm@@ ug@@ gling - s@@ wis@@ ely or un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly - by security , those who were most often flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are some complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain , which liquids are allowed to take them or how much of it .
it &apos;s no surprise that the biggest amount of conf@@ is@@ cated items prohibited by the T@@ SA .
for a time , people thought that T@@ SA could view books as sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla batteries do not cancel .
electro @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k takes you with the huge number of pre @-@ reservation for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has previously reported that a part of the customers has already withdrawn its un@@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures on sales and more , sales targets , Tesla chief El@@ on Mus@@ k underwent a second , less gl@@ anced number for the first time : the cancell@@ ations made during the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k frequently asked with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car over the last few months , whose delivery is just starting .
now , Mus@@ k has dreamed : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders a total of 6@@ 3.000 have been withdrawn again .
critics have always noted that it is a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays homage to 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation deposit . &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 such un@@ wind reservations , admitted Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
that the cancellation of so far exceeds twelve percent of all orders to be solved , however , the Tesla boss does not believe .
his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets does not lie on demand , but on the production site .
last year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 - all models have to be taken together - 500,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; at the earliest in the second half of 2018 , if Tesla manages to drive its brand new , yet never in practice tested production lines without any maximum load .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but comes to greater del@@ ays , then the in@@ competence of reservations could become a problem for Tesla .
for then , the company can &apos;t allow un@@ satisfied customers to per@@ ate in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt retired due to the provisions of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
one day after he had been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , had to delay its former decision to reduce the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g causing air@@ borne agents .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as its agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities as opposed to previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his previous post in a German Federal Court .
it is about a deadline which expired on 1 October for States to hold the 2015 standards for ground @-@ floor o@@ zone o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will not hesitate to spend a year in order to study his authority more time , to study the plan and to prevent &quot; in local decisions , or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s prosecutor in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a long time a reliable adversary for demanding environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block reg@@ ulations , or to refuse to resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden change from Wednesday is the latest legal blow for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory run@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Appeals Court decided that the EPA @-@ administrator its authority has exceeded that the implementation of a rule by Obama administration , the oil and gas companies committed to monitoring and reduce methane de@@ cks to delay .
on Wednesday evening statement , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its turn @-@ back turn on o@@ zone standards simply imp@@ lies the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States by the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfilling the new standards .
&quot; under earlier administr@@ ations , the EPA often cited the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then was waiting to be prosec@@ uted by activists and others , and in an agreement on the appointment for the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who gave the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation through judicial procedures , and we take the dead@@ lines seriously .
we also take the law and authority to exist , seriously . &quot;
nevertheless , the comments stated by the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt asks its &quot; power to delay and all other legally available to &quot; order to ensure that the regulations &quot; based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
one last month &apos;s draft bill should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the intervention was not provided in the Senate .
the New York State At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition &apos;s coalition , said that the EPA voted in this week said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers , and over 115 million Americans that are directly affected by the smo@@ g , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ as , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ o@@ zone arises when pollut@@ ants made from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemistry plants and other sources in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the free smo@@ g can cause serious groups of human respiratory problems , and each year can contribute to thousands of premature fat@@ alities each year .
representatives of public health services and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about P@@ ru@@ itts surprising course change .
&quot; it &apos;s wor@@ ris@@ ome how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by those responsible for the protection of the air we breathe in , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological cruci@@ fix@@ ion of the Tr@@ ump government to op@@ pose environmental @-@ poll@@ uting and their special interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church is invited to the old cemetery @-@ area of Tum@@ our on Sunday , July 16th , at 4.@@ 30 pm at a Ser@@ en@@ ade .
whether his idyl@@ lic location and beautiful views over the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can con@@ j@@ ure themselves from this powerful place .
rescue and preser@@ vation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and pat@@ rons of their particular concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ izes : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ fine small od . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ gian secret guide , &quot; Count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with which it @-@ based parish church to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the certificate according to the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger mountain , except the former parish church , a magnificent court , belonged to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right belonged , and not vice versa .
so there were people living there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the town of Tum@@ our , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 , this historical conditions under@@ lies .
the pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right was created from the early medieval town of egg .
a lord , who built a church , held out and occupied with a priest , remained in the owner of this church , and he was able to inherit it .
thus , it was the right to use a priest or propose a new priest to the Bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the bigger ones of the two zer@@ os at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was first heard in 16@@ 92 , but had to be left later in the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows are st@@ acked and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in the year 1796 the French troops entered the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and ch@@ urch@@ yard elements , and used them as fire@@ wood .
in 1809 the rem@@ nants of the church threatened to fall in 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead of Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the steep@@ le was standing .
in the New Year of 1834 , a storm divided the steep@@ le and half collapsed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken off .
only today , today still existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ em is dealing with the &quot; Schaff@@ ner Rent@@ als &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant .
as organizers invite friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ ens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Kepler @-@ Gymnasium in Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .
town of Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the epil@@ og .
the programme starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 a.m .
to the conclusion of the Ser@@ en@@ ade a trunk will be held in front of the cemetery .

Association plans to check permission of wind turbines
in Bo@@ ish@@ es@@ eim , &quot; no legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned towards the Council .
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; is invited &quot; Coun@@ cil@@ or Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to restore its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of the approval on December 30 , 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette have no wind power plants could be approved , as at the time at the border with Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal , a wind power concentration camp existed .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy facilities are generally possible , but the concentration zone provides a exclusion of wind power use for the rest of the city .
such zones are to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had a few days earlier by a change in the area plan to a second wind force zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but it had not approved the district government Düsseldorf , because of a form of form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council once again decided the wind concentration camp in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; an auth@@ orization of the district government still stands out .
Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; this is the arrangement of approval for the creation of wind energy systems planning legal . &quot;
the circle confirms the input of the collection .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received since past week in the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; said a speaker .
the circle makes it a reason to re @-@ check the matter again .
however , they do not indicate that the procedure will be stopped .
with a view on ongoing procedures at the administrative court , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to express itself to the arguments of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette building of four each 200 meters high wind turbines .
already last year , the company , which has been involved in the town of Vier@@ sen , has closed down in P@@ acht@@ contracts with the owners of about 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind energy systems , the electricity needs to be covered by some 11 400 households - this corresponds to roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity consumption of all four @-@ power households .
the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer , the green light was green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in Far@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and Tra@@ ctor : woman Di@@ ed with horri@@ ble accident
one terrible traffic accident has occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was hurt in his eyes .
two more persons were slightly injured .
the state road remained blocked for hours .
after police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch went on board with her passenger car as part of the accompanying trip with her 53 year old mother as accompanying person .
city and dealers plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ chard a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover shopping in the city center in September .
the commercial association and the city administration wants to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the inhabitants for shopping spre@@ e in downtown .
as the chair@@ woman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will be sensitive to secure the customers of their own city away from usual supermarket goods .
therefore , a market with regional providers are planned , similar to the weekly market .
local companies are to present themselves with their training places .
in addition , the shops of the city center should invite &quot; even at night shopping . &quot;
here , the action does not only relate to residents of the city and the near region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet @-@ video and printed bag that point to the share weekend , says Christian König .
municipal Auth@@ orities and Trade Association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
so the commercial club and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive Centre . &quot;
these include new offers , such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the Brun@@ n@@ en@@ fest ) together with res@@ ellers on Sunday , talks with all tra@@ ders and hosts to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the publisher on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
please , customer potential to be re@@ opened or once more .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but many locals would have lost the city center at a glance .
in the end , everyone would have to help to bel@@ low the city center - to land@@ lords , operators all over the city and clubs .
it landed , with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y , which had spread abroad , king in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Mü@@ hl@@ hausen , Germany shared the country &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day for the first time five Thuring@@ ian cities .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , So@@ fit@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Abi@@ cher@@ ode .
the day should &quot; advert@@ ise the appreciation of local trade and raise its importance to the common one of our cities , &quot; says Stre@@ ich .
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK , and with many partners also make it clear that every citizen can influence his self @-@ respon@@ sive environment .

Tr@@ ump put down tran@@ scription of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts from telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a phone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to mention the public that he would not pay for a scheduled border wall .
the U.S. president affir@@ med him because he den@@ ounced the wall in public . according to the report , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall in the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first accus@@ ation with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ ds were also released and revealed a offensive exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ key , that a trade for the U.S. refugees to emig@@ rate to Australia , &quot; ridic@@ ulous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; would let him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; that he proposed to ban refugees in the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had told the gent@@ leman , &quot; that is the most un@@ pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford : activists conduct rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ year @-@ old Ford Bath drove through a group of spectators in the countryside of Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his path .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man @-@ aged couple in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous suit - took a long move on its cig@@ ar and looked at the test by the wind@@ shield .
inside , the occup@@ ants were moved in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
sc@@ ared the silence , when a young black man was torn apart from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a reproduction .
but when a loop around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , almost all of them caught in the audience very real sigh@@ s .
since 2005 , citizens are coming back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey , were sal@@ uted by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was indicted for murder .
&quot; it is really un@@ predic@@ table that no one person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who also helps in the organization of reproduction .
&quot; it is a dirt of a story , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of the State of Georgia and a life of civil law@@ lers .
for him it acts as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want to prosec@@ ute the termination , we want the termination , we want reconciliation , but first we need to receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
one of the court reports a towel on the bodies of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI actors , who received from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ trial .
but none was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , Citi@@ zenship say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions were always known in the whole city : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens to return to Georgia for the first time to quit their vote in the summer .
about the same time as the election did according to the FBI of the black colour but@@ cher Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supposedly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said the rum@@ our had been in the city that H@@ ester has slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby , which she bore , had not descended from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com , the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her Cou@@ sins Mae Murray , and George Dor@@ sey .
but when she walked away from prison and approached the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b ring the car around .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared the kill@@ ings and arranged , &quot; includes an FBI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks make it even more magnificent .
&quot; it was an electoral law , &quot; he said .
&quot; you were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
its representation is illustr@@ ative , comprehen@@ sible , and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believe that he does not exist in America .
it &apos;s difficult to look , and more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are confron@@ ted with the ug@@ liness in us , &quot; she said .
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or want to hear what I &apos;ve been doing . &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest Black - entered into a room and in wait where Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a German co @-@ director here .
he played the role of the boss cl@@ an@@ ties for years , but he said , the role will never be simpler .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so &quot; I said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story to life , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room tried the actor Dar@@ ren Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester &apos;s cri@@ es and pushed him , ang@@ ered that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- he was w@@ asted away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a inv@@ okes the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs best .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still somewhat rest@@ rained .
&quot; I simply do not believe that white people at that time &apos; n --- he said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black performer .
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and precisely because the energy in space is shifting , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy making this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once more .
this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it is sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , kis@@ ses and then silence .
a woman , clothed with a mour@@ ned dress , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and leads Che@@ e Holidays , trau@@ ma &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it a group of about four dozens of crowd and tears are caught out of the eyes .
the audience is divided equally between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing humidity when Bro@@ oks lead them on a pilgrimage to the tomb of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote but now when they found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels fla@@ wed .
when the final notes of the songs will sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and to inspec@@ t the dead bodies .
kids ho@@ cks to their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ bles a little boy , as if he reminds himself .
after a couple of minutes , Gre@@ ene gives a lot - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch arrow away and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ced Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , which the cl@@ an@@ member has played .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ces two of his players and breaks down in their arms , the emotional bur@@ dens of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this from a reason . &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors together .
a white pair of Atlanta stim@@ ulated a white pair with a black pair , which they had just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski had to find words which has left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these horri@@ ble words and deeds ... of people who like to look like yourself and those that do , because they look like this , &quot; she said .
&quot; what I really do with me makes me believe that the ly@@ re is still going on , &quot; added , &quot; today it is called &quot; Police shooting &quot; today . &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks &apos;s farm is at his table , eating and re@@ members the civil rights .
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspired in a certain way , because she describes the terror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s like we can learn from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study his own history , who doesn &apos;t know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; id@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmer@@ ing &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental works , Director Frank Cast@@ orf reli@@ es on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story back@@ drop .
the stage platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) displays a sh@@ ab@@ ated street corner together with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ stics and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from DDR days or New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car in which the Rhine river is pos@@ ing as a rock star , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil drums recall Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - pulling out through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhein@@ bla@@ zers - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke L@@ mid@@ wives and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as well as in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
soon they run Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier one body in the trunk and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the delight@@ fully Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box .
brutal scene when he proposes Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) also needs to believe on it .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
storms are celebrated with Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke , and conductor Jan@@ owski , who mo@@ ver@@ ted himself and le@@ ver@@ ted her hands to the Merkel @-@ space .
great appl@@ ause is available for the Festival Orchestra , which shows first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in empty leisure clothing .
the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam were also expected .
in 2013 , he had to leave a whi@@ st@@ ling whi@@ st@@ ling whi@@ st@@ ling in 2013 , there were five years later , in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls left out .
Festival Orchestra in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased about that .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience didn &apos;t only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of its view .
I prefer a positive res@@ ume .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteers right at the same time in several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in a piece of stone in the furniture store , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven at the furniture bridge .
and I have also worked at the school in an open day .
how are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , broad spectrum I see here .
I have different people with young people , with young people , with young adults .
they are 26 years now , a late professional volunteer .
how does this come from ?
quantity : I have a secondary school .
and then a study of civil engineering , let &apos;s say , successfully canc@@ eled .
I recognized that it is the wrong one for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year , there &apos;s a gli@@ mp@@ se , you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe even , really is .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester .
I will probably study dual @-@ studies , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not un@@ common to have several different applications during the volunteer work ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you do his FS@@ J .
from the retirement home , it can be done from the age @-@ home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partially in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care guide .
for me , this was the right one thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering ?
a lot : well , here it &apos;s not about to calculate statistics .
one always has other people in front , each of which have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a young person who has been picked up from the family - you must always go individually .
very interesting .
and they had no touch @-@ calling ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is a field that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s life .
Pear@@ son sp@@ ared up additional 3,000 work@@ places and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will disman@@ tle another 3,000 jobs and will cut its interim measures by 72 percent , since another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company was confron@@ ted .
the amount of job reducing the General Director John Fall@@ on predominantly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring , at which 4,000 positions were lost .
Pear@@ son announced a plan to cost a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May in a third cost reduction programme to revi@@ ve a business which was hit by a fast step towards the digital learning .
the company , which was sold last month its involvement in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House on the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for fiscal year remained unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
Kabul &apos;s con@@ voy : NATO soldier was killed in suicide attacks
a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , killing soldiers of Nato and several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ters were injured , a statement by NATO .
according to local reports , local reports reportedly killed three civilians during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last non@@ violence that met Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber lasted two people close to the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
in a statement by NATO , the explosion occurred on Thursday night , when a common pat@@ rol was attacked by the Afghan army of one &quot; of persons carried impro@@ vised . &quot;
the statement states that all injured in a stable state and in the US military hospital can be treated on the air@@ field Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ b@@ ance killed at least 30 people in one of Kabul &apos;s mainly Shi@@ ite district .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on 31 May , a tremendous bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the fatal milit@@ ant assault of the country , since the US guided troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Tr@@ ump wat@@ ered to support the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul has also a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy , and particularly in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ts Dec@@ ision to Delay Smo@@ g Rule by Kl@@ agen@@ um
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has delayed a decision to susp@@ end a government regulation of Obama , which states that the states are obliged to em@@ ulate the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done a day after 15 states accused the Agency because of the step of stri@@ de .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to promote the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ment 2015 &quot; in advance , and said that she shows the commitment to the agency to work with States .
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and remin@@ ded that we react to our state partner , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement .
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA , the o@@ zone regulations - in which part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions are to determine where inc@@ isions were to be made to hold more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed an action on Tuesday , saying that effort is illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to re @-@ establish a wide range of environmental impacts , imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a bro@@ ader agenda according to Tr@@ ump &apos;s economic growth .
the effort , however , triggered the response of the Democrats and nature @-@ groups that concerns about the impact of greater emissions to public health .
the EPA &apos;s website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , o@@ zone containing &quot; reduces lung function and can rein@@ force respiratory symptoms , such as asthma .
municipal wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two things he decides to decide on the establishment of a community living room in the future course of the future .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still lack of land was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it still will last until the church &apos;s church is owned in the municipal property , there is now no planning experience for the project to establish a private investor .
there is a discussion regarding a common area .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters and a bor@@ dering terrace with a total of 70 square meters space for a special price .
the administration and majority of the Municipal Council swe@@ ars down , such a common room , not as the meeting point for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ ical living spaces , but openly into the church .
for example , the word from the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the turn .
the decision to disp@@ ose by the provision of means of the ongoing budget has been pre @-@ decided in the last autumn by sponsor@@ ing possibilities .
the building is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , as reported as T@@ j@@ ans , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the decision looks to sign@@ alize the investor that in this way there is no b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs , the conclusion is that both artic@@ ulated - what the tr@@ ash @-@ height is reduced and the construction of economic power - can be possible .

in Har@@ z from Star to Stern
in Har@@ z the world &apos;s first &quot; star path &quot; will be created .
this is the institute of ob@@ servatory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary track in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star@@ path &quot; come to meet the information needs of many Har@@ da@@ ys@@ ers , it was named .
it connects nature , science , exercise and sporting performance .
the members want to set up on the scheduled route boards , and inform members of the stars and star images .
during the first phase of 2018 , the association plans &quot; well at@@ tain@@ able installations in five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ quire St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets are to be completed by the internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the site selection .
accessibility is also a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later , the train path should be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ path had experienced much knowledge of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the club declared .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star stronger than another , although it is significantly removed .
also , in which constellation can find a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , in 2014 , the highest mountain ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany .
according to the National Park Har@@ z national park , the Federal Office for Nature Conservation is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the galaxy and even the Andromeda Galaxy clearly can be seen with naked eye .
since 2003 , at the University of the University there has been a similar simil@@ arity at the planetary ne@@ b@@ arium &quot; planet@@ arium - the planet@@ arium .
starting in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary way leads up to Hain@@ berg and the Ob@@ servatory - and a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ emar@@ den ( municipality Equ@@ ations ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the bases with the individual planets - including des towards the d@@ warf plan@@ ed P@@ lu@@ to at the end point - are exactly the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ ink on a sphere of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun measures exactly 75 meters away .
the total distance of the planet@@ arium is just four kilometres .
while the sun is required by sun up to P@@ lu@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans require a good hour to reach P@@ lu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .

Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision course to stages the most exciting boxing fight in the near future of 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ fair World Bo@@ xing Council Ligh@@ tweight champion , down the hall@@ way to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super @-@ Feder@@ ated Champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions World @-@ Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters members of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .
Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; How are you doing , champion ?
I wish you a good luck . &quot;

when the couple was pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ nick@@ enko &apos;s manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that there would be a possible show@@ down between the fighters that would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former Feder@@ ated weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I have risen for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I &apos;m not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to get on light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
Klim@@ as asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that will fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound finish in this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date to match the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell , after their lightweight @-@ weight title fighting in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; this battle could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked after him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and pushed open later , on the network to fight , which offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can create this type of attention .
when are they ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he wrote Lom@@ ach@@ enko as a &quot; enormous fighter &quot; and he will probably take part in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held at the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three battle champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks &quot; very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to do the Ko @-@ Off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxing .
they said they could feel the moment@@ um , that was built up for their own combat .
&quot; this is the struggle that needs to be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I have waited for the top fighter and this is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four Se@@ ed to T@@ ire plat@@ ter
on Thursday afternoon four people were seriously injured during an accident on the A7 .
after initial information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost shortly before the end of the market . presumably , after the end of the market , the driver is believed to have control over his vehicle .
the car went right into the slope , where he over@@ threw himself and then remained on the roof in the grave .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first power of the injured rescue service , the A7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left crossing was led by accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; rotation chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is hoping for the season op@@ ener to Braunschweig for ensuring the optim@@ isation of def@@ enses in Au@@ e points .
the first season of the season was Andre Hoffmann , with the result that there were not the two opponents at the 2 : 2 versus Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two counter@@ parts too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e better , &quot; says the def@@ endant of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the ore mountains , the triple chain is to be optimized further .
and a gate after a fre@@ eroll , the continuation of the road , too , will not fall into any more .
for the future there will be so , no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew also comes to the experience in preparing with the three chain better than with the four @-@ buys .
&quot; still , I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; his trainer Fried@@ helm Fun@@ ds , but Hoffmann is himself in his own cause , &quot; because we are just being able to build the sem@@ iconductor chain in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; the requirement is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ious and we do not afford such a lot of ab@@ normal@@ ities . &quot;
but Hoffmann is also riding to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; but if one can talk about an acci@@ dental start , don &apos;t know .
the performance might well be okay , &quot; he said Hoffmann .
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup we will certainly speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
his coach did not want to know anything .
&quot; the start into the season I was only after six to eight playing days , &quot; Fried@@ helm Fun@@ ds who would not speak of an advantage over au@@ e only because the game of Saxony was cancelled due to a temp@@ est for the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim .
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home match , &quot; said Fun@@ ds and Hoffmann might believe that the players from Au@@ e might even be a little fresh , since they could have no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against the trouble @-@ fav@@ es in the bones .
&quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 % where they are standing , &quot; says the inter@@ defence of Fort@@ una .
while guests come from the Rhineland as an easier favorite on Sunday in the meeting ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one has to suggest from the out@@ set , &quot; says Fort@@ unas Music coach .
&quot; to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so , Fun@@ ds will not be able to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum seek@@ ers published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested people were older than 18 years . but not everyone believes on the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Bro@@ ts@@ ab@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
they should be more exact during the asylum application of the age after the Swedish migration agency ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) , because of errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees , which were under@@ aged .
until today , mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et 6.@@ 880 has to be tested and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published its results from a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency determined that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are only performed in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constantly growing during the last months .
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly consistent , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases where the person has been evaluated as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has to be balanced about his age .
in May the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there was 4@@ 42 cases giving &quot; propose that the examined person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det exam@@ ines the 5@@ 81 results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person thought that it would be 18 years old .
the method of medical examination ass@@ essments , for X @-@ rays of white @-@ teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has been critic@@ ised even in some areas .
a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work comprises the assessment of the biological maturity of people , to see if they were sooner or later than usually passed by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used .
jud@@ ging the biological age in this way is very un@@ certainty .
if we cannot say it safely , we should not do so as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of testing : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of reducing a child as an adult is poor .
the biggest risk is when the person is below 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in Plan
the works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are moving well .
on Wednesday , a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Light , Construction Manager at the Road Construction and Transport in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg .
in April , the work began simultaneously in all three basic needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is planned for October and is secure to keep the tim@@ etable .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault wooden bridge built with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come to the years .
to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges take over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning at the north side a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons , so called br@@ ück@@ ner fla@@ p .
this is a Rand@@ om version , which is also used as a road .
on Friday the southern part of the bridge should be used a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge valve .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to pass .
the particular thing is that it is involved in manufacturing components , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge coat .
special finger@@ tip sensitivity has required the laying of lines through the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ label connected with many companies .
local residents were informed about the project in advance of work reports .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building of the building and the collectors in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic in the lane is regulated by a traffic light .
construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bacher &apos;s entrance is the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; in the area of the bridge .
the cost of the three bridge deck amounts to 700 000 Euro .
it is funded by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest for German potato salad
it is not so common that parties take part in a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring to a hat .
the Parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left Opposition ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag on this day because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell into a large election campaign .
and known names of the start - like Alice Wei@@ der , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , is the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already before the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to the African developers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the town @-@ pic@@ nic is planned under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; at the Brun@@ n@@ en@@ platz , but it is now on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus , right before the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forums One World and one of the relevant organis@@ ers , was really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
there &apos;s music and lots of food , among them a &quot; ur@@ red potato salad , which could also eat the A@@ fr@@ o without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him with him .
the police has ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence above all at the train station , just a few metres from the venues .
how did Af@@ D have actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes are reported by the A@@ fr@@ o Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he has tried for such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf initially asked in Dau@@ n initially , but there is a cancellation because because of the already built Laur@@ ent@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available .
so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
overlooking the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peace@@ fully . &quot;
this also does : at 20 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse speakers , including the Rhineland @-@ pf@@ en@@ ian Af@@ D @-@ President Uwe Young .
in the hall , about 200 listen@@ ers who wait for the Bundestag to wait for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ der , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch their speech@@ es .
the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than one hour , the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there &apos;s up shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can back off - no special inci@@ dents .
trombone meets trumpet
a goodbye with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is located in the series Has@@ l@@ acher &apos;s monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday at 8 : 00 pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; in Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore , &quot; meets classic German education with roots in brass music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of many international competitions and have held solo positions in European countries .
thus Pet@@ kov sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the lust , not only the limits on their instruments , but also melt the boundaries of the various gen@@ res .
thus , Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new look at the two such as in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s world music &quot; combines himself with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz @-@ driver N@@ ils W@@ enza , mix classic , jazz and the free games to a fascinating overall art work .
this core piece of the program was first performed in spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ atz has written it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher &apos;s church with its special acou@@ stics will be deliberately moved into the concert with their particular Ac@@ ou@@ stics .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love bar@@ bec@@ ues , and will eat it to the end of their lives .
but I would like to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart totally open to her bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; when I bite the cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what coming next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood celebr@@ ities was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bitter@@ ly .
despite all this , the br@@ arian per@@ formers have insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with any one who I founded .
or do you believe me , I would have played it ? &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten decided that she is bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I always lived and seriously believed in the du@@ alism .
so it has never confused or interfer@@ ed with me .
I never liked it to be taken seriously . &quot;
especially among them suffered them according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school time , as they rather dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a Bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
now I look back and believe me : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public , they don &apos;t like to love their love life : &quot; people expect you to have a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
and perhaps some of them call me and ank@@ le , but I don &apos;t like to justify the whole public . &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed themselves from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and many things ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow , I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice .
&quot; as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump spoke before a great announcement in the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice didn &apos;t appro@@ ve the democratic can@@ did@@ acy of Hillary Clinton .
Justice , which is said according to Forbes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes presents the fact that he possesses coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal store from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republican Committee on Thursday evening filed a statement in which it said : &quot; the party of party of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather hin@@ der us to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last ref@@ us@@ al of a party that is from top to bottom without the leadership , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement the C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E praises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the world leader of ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as a manifest exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be included in the sport .
Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics CEO Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile in his country was correct , and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
he said , &quot; sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were cut off in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress held for maintaining the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) not@@ ices in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to rep@@ orters .
&quot; the entire council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation is in themselves aware that it has experienced some hot times and everything will do everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
CO@@ E said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think that progress have been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes of the un@@ tain@@ ted system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will begin with the ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that begin on Friday in London to compete with the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the ladder of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia should meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setup .

&quot; we bow down before this highest sacrifice , which they have done in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; explained .
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief Apostle from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Republic .
their s@@ coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a funeral of the Bundes@@ wehr to the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at noon , only the relatives arrested at the Church .
afterwards the funeral service in the circle of the family , eng@@ his friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the General Inspec@@ torate of the German army Volker Wie@@ ker .
the sad@@ est lay down ro@@ ses , the relatives of the arm were in arms at the coff@@ ins .
before the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
the Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen marked the controversial soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and full @-@ in .
the Chief Musi@@ pt@@ mann had built the flight operations of the helicopter type Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar , and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regim@@ ent .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the Regim@@ ent , to which the soldiers belong , &quot; if this crew might not turn off the crash , no one would have mo@@ ist . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali showed ministers from the Le@@ Ngu@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
but he is also of high importance for a country , from which we are separated by two states , &quot; she said .
after the funeral , the s@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr made no information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife .
this was the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard produced a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the Queen may agree with the decision of her husband , and it was further stated in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ ent to teach in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a H@@ eh@@ l that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ ott@@ age of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have been a king .
in 2016 he retired , and also entitled &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not have the title and the function he wanted to see himself against his wife , not as equivalent to his wife - and not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish king .
the final resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be ultimately un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ ent to be buried in his French country , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the German @-@ born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew over , Prince Hen@@ rik , in his almost 50 years , had a serious stand at the Dan@@ en .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik expresses over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was win@@ dy , I preferred wine instead of beer , Sil@@ k stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ff , which I smoke instead of Virginia tobacco and those in this country had the reputation to be the brand social @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for night .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to use fla@@ p new elections
CDU and F@@ DP in front of any majority in Lower Saxony
defe@@ ats Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( S@@ DP ) is in accordance with the loss of red @-@ green government multi @-@ election for a rapid re @-@ selection of the day , but he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ sign .
because of the parliamentary resolution , the parliamentary resolution spoke out on Friday .
previously , the surprising exit of a Green Party dep@@ uties in Lower Saxony was over@@ thrown by the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in Lower Saxony .
five months before the official date of the country code , the red @-@ green coalition lost its cre@@ ep by a majority in Parliament to the opposition of the CDU and F@@ DP opposition .
the old green group of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets set up their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its election circle in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; stated on Friday in Hanover .
CDU faction of the Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to record it .
in that way , CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony &apos;s Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new day is elected to the January 14th of the year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they could continue to rule this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Weil keeps it indispensable for indispensable that the national day decides to implement his self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction will likely decide on Tuesday for further progress .
the constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament wants to trust trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these possibilities need to be legal and clean , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; one will discuss all questions when they are subject to legal knowledge . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the &quot; West ens step &quot; but something cur@@ ative . &quot;
the polit@@ ician himself stressed : &quot; I am not convic@@ ting .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a ple@@ a from Black @-@ Green .
the Green Party requested the MPs &apos; Euro MPs to return their country convention .
&quot; of course , we expect it from the fact that they received their land convention , which she has received through the green state of Land , with immediate effect , &quot; distributed by the state of met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
the pre@@ sidents of the Green An@@ ja PI@@ EL said : &quot; we are regre@@ t@@ ting the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ er . &quot;
she deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; even in front of the fact that there were no content differences , we can &apos;t withdraw this step . &quot;
SPD candidate candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the candidate of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ota to the CDU as a tre@@ ason .
the conduct of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook .
he will support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the national day .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony , the majority .
the political scientist , &quot; in its last vanity , and their personal interests prior to the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General , Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation .
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is mit@@ ig@@ ning against this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ating and tried to propose a political capital . &quot;
speech of the CDU faction Commander Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend to the CDU faction to the CDU .
the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the v@@ ests , with a personal career advice on the outcome of the 2013 country election .
the CDU was the strongest party at the time before the SPD , the SPD and the Green Party had a breath@@ ed majority in a vote .
Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect against tox@@ ins , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses over contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage everyone to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
on the Consumer Protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the German states are presenting the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ char@@ gen .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to everything we currently know , there is practically impossible to health .
will Al@@ di take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
the food monitoring is the task of the German states .
nevertheless , my house has immediately stepped up and is located since the dis@@ closure of Germany in the close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trading has just as the manufacturer to ensure that the sold products are tra@@ ce@@ able and harmless to health .
if at eggs the resi@@ due level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not bu@@ c@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time , not the establishments can blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the ze@@ able characteristic , the production plants does not meet immediate fault .
rather , they must reck@@ on due to the illegal illeg@@ ally practition@@ ers of services related to economic defects .
however , in the harvest there is too little checking .
is it missing only on the staff or even at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls , which revealed the process .
the truth also belongs to the fact that food fraud and crimin@@ als can never be ruled by 100 percent .
therefore , a consistent adv@@ ancing of such events and hand@@ ing over to the state office in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be found , of crucial importance .
I have already made it several times , that I expect from the responsible authorities a trans@@ itory enlighten@@ ment .
is the regular alarm system really necessary for food business ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get only safe and reliable food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer consumers and consumers are entitled to right .
by the given means , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ pron@@ il is not removable in the attitude of life @-@ sized animals is not removable , and must be stopped immediately .
it has to be applied consistently and worked with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all relevant authorities that the atomic fact becomes frequent and comprehen@@ sible .
how the rules of the soccer ball to Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent infinite expenses from European football exp@@ ir@@ ation , Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain shouldn &apos;t distur@@ b .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain of the UEFA , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has power to negoti@@ ate teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEFA , mean that PS@@ G had to point out at some point that the transfer from Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without a major loss .
Barcelona has paid $ 222 million ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to France .
PS@@ G may easily make money easy with safety , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar writes and bring him into a galaxy to other stars , in view of the funding of the teams by the wealth of the rich ruler of Qatar .
clubs may need much money for the purchase of players , but must be used with legitim@@ ate revenue sources who enable them to break the break @-@ Even point in their on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini , named UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations , who had received enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ky to ru@@ in when banks or owners went back their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration to the liabilities of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the modification meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ o@@ vich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , invested a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tou@@ g@@ her matter .
during the three @-@ year FF@@ P en@@ camp period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and even though Plat@@ ini is pleased by the presidency in Bel@@ g@@ nade is his UEFA successor to Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to deter them from excessive expenditure .
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P isn &apos;t dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible for the UEFA Under FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the net cash clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of his treaty .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five year contract , so that the read@@ ings for the next five years can be exp@@ elled at an annual financial statements of 4@@ 4.4 million euros .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tou@@ gh@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players will be limited .
the UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to ou@@ tw@@ it their financial statements by companies using the owners of a club , with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company could transp@@ ose the PS@@ G , if the value of the sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market tradition , UEFA would not be considered legitim@@ ate in@@ comes .
it was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of PSA by Qatar Tourism Authority was blo@@ wn up .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come upon payments of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have disputed that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup will be amb@@ ass@@ adors to find out a great maneu@@ ver for UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to handle any attempt to deal with the rules .
UEFA has no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke in the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not able to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of € 54@@ 2,4 million a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ ym@@ ars arrive a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot kern@@ els .
the Association assumes that sales are expected to rise by at least 30 per cent after the signing of the signing .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football player , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ars Weg@@ ener by making PS@@ G viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of Kat@@ ars the last owner of the PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservation by La Liga against a state that has financed an association .
&quot; it &apos;s the consequence of the ownership and has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it &apos;s very difficult to respect the financial FA@@ IR@@ PLA@@ Y , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such great actor in order to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new donation supplier
in the past few years Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y board @-@ chocolate has produced for Swiss Life .
now the resolutions on a possible end : the airline writes the order .
Swiss @-@ spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ ist confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , Air@@ line will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be tested every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y we are very happy , &quot; said the spokesperson .
approximately 17 million small @-@ white wrapped sk@@ og@@ g@@ it@@ af@@ eln to 14 grams are distributed each year before landing at the passengers .
regarding the costs , Swiss didn &apos;t want to make any information .
industry insi@@ der appreci@@ ates the volume of a volume of 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , with an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
as many applicants there are on the next call , Swiss will not be betra@@ yed .
in question , however , only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
according to the newspaper report , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to pursue a renewal of the Treaty on the spring 2018 .
for S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer had not been reached for a position .
throughout 2006 , chocolate boards have been distributed on board of their flights .
before Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate @-@ tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo was Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
in the Business Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y are spo@@ iled on long distance routes .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y also distri@@ butes both in business and economy class .

this repet@@ ition of history is nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s years , for the 90 @-@ year gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ ot the Sk@@ etch comedy , &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth Ban@@ ks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is a par@@ ody and em@@ bo@@ diment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era , permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time was getting short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprising fairly well , not just because of its absurd mind ( it contained a original story for a speaking canned vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by turning to the core of the g@@ ags - actor , middle @-@ ages play g@@ aps children who will grow up - nevertheless they create the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the widow .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotional ro@@ oted and its par@@ ody is more after the wat@@ ering principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ s as &quot; The Hand That She@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that cra@@ dle the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
one point St@@ bert is a character featuring an Apple Power@@ book , some In@@ line skating , and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ ot ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .

and there is another go @-@ v@@ icious plot that was included in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Sho@@ ot ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
like always , the courses in the best part of fran@@ chise are .
it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d to see the Matt D@@ nie@@ per &apos;s sub@@ mate of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
there are the Mom@@ b@@ ular Wa@@ hn@@ sin@@ ns that could pre@@ heat this fran@@ chise like a kind of repet@@ itive &quot; seven @-@ up ! &quot; series , until he reaches that which I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band as they will visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now rec@@ alls a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even an &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East against West Ring@@ ing I@@ con@@ ography .

the main fill@@ ers - a hard @-@ washed Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose dialog@@ ues of chann@@ eling Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt can be syn@@ ced to English .
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police spend the time to watch chess in television , as Americans may do it with football ) .
and the list of the famous spokes@@ man - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent playing &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; for a decent playing &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda @-@ drama - a mur@@ derer that carries a Reagan @-@ mask is included - that it often plays like a single one .
with six long episodes , it moves away , and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; who has been taken up on a lower length , could always visit his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visits the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who lost a he@@ ap of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the Imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to the food for a gel@@ age .

shock against Drugs @-@ ma@@ fia in the Land
the police had a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ District , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Esslingen and Stuttgart were searched numerous objects , such as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office on Friday .
in doing so , 15 were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 , and already issued on arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the officers provided greater marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand euros .
at the same Raz@@ cia in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the ma@@ fia members conven@@ e , organised crime crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y of rob@@ ber@@ y .
since the summer of 2016 , the public prosecutor in Kon@@ stanz have been investigating on organised drug commerce in southern Germany .
between the public relations between Constance and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had daily contacts with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the big deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the visor of investigations were mainly Italian nationals with respect to the Italian ma@@ fia .
a incident occurred on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , which had been fired several shots at a restaurant in the morning , should go to the band &apos;s accounts .
ways acknowledge great g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner register
&quot; data of citizens who should not appear &quot; : according to a report , the fore@@ igner register has significant defects in Germany .
that lead to part gra@@ zing patches against asylum procedures .
the Federal Government Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has made a media report to large g@@ aps in the Aus@@ län@@ der@@ cent@@ al@@ register .
short@@ com@@ ings of the data registered there could be part of asylum procedures and deportation , &quot; resulting in part serious failure , &quot; warned way in an analysis written by the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the registry , ten million people are reported by foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administ@@ rated by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been well cared for , the data quality in parts has so far been not good so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; of people who have long been alive , or citizens who have become German citizen and should not appear anymore in the register . &quot;
&quot; err@@ one@@ ous data inser@@ ts can significantly slow down back@@ mar@@ es , &quot; it continues to the report .
in statistics of emig@@ rate people , EU citizens are covered , that would not have to travel beyond .
but such false orders , however , led to a dist@@ orted debate on the use of emig@@ ration , so that is , in the analysis .
meanwhile , the federal government clearly began to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when they visited there .
this emerg@@ es from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ra@@ er Zeitung comments . &quot;
in the paper , therefore , the B@@ AM@@ F lead such methods for families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 again . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , practically no longer was possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation was on the spot .
after the Dublin agreement it is responsible for refugees in the EU state to reach them first .
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can return it to the country .
for this reason , the office now write : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot;
Italy has left for the recording and accommodation of family warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) support these comm@@ it@@ ments for sufficient .
other EU states would also return to refugees in the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ oping down due to the defects in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living persons were already available to other people .
at least twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
in all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now part@@ ed with his 100 donations in the meantime , donated 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the Municipal Council has multiplied the multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is in@@ gen@@ ious how our body is created for it and we z@@ ily provide the donations that their blood is available for foreigners , nor is a non @-@ profit , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the circular head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , for the preser@@ ves are broken into their components .
for example , three people could benefit from a blood don@@ ating .
at the same time Ma@@ isen@@ bach reviewed the actions that were carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; in this year we achieved 114 competitors , the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ circular carrier .

Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening the spec@@ ulation over a rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; income &quot; will remain as they hold interest rates into family in the middle of a intensi@@ fying print .
the S @-@ Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed at 6 to 2 to hold interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in this month because the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in their quarterly annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 , that the pressure on bud@@ get@@ ing income would continue , however , inflation in the autumn is likely to rise to just under 3 % .
but it indicates that over the next few years , interest rate would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation of Bre@@ xit and it said that the cost of lending would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut @-@ Business package that was published before a year after Bre@@ xit .
it will challenge you for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources from the coming of February , although it is expected that they are expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billions of Po@@ unds .
after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pre@@ diction of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) stays weak in the short period since the pressure on the reality consumption of households will continue to consumption consumption . &quot;
the interest rates repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required to increase inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; dimension than the markets .
markets are projected to increase the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another year 2020 .
the Bank however stressed that enh@@ ancements &quot; gradually limits &quot; gradually . &quot;
the Bank forecast down@@ correct growth forecasts for this and next year , projected to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ unds fell by this news from the dollar and the euro .
the Po@@ unds fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change occurs after the latest dis@@ appo@@ inting growth rate has increased the rising expectations of interest rates and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly re@@ covering after the Bank at the end of the year .
the latest annual rate of inflation offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by increasing inflation and minimal pay@@ pal , since it is going to become worse before they will repair themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also reinforced by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , resulting in a part of the lower consumer expenditure .
the decision comes after a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of blood .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy completely .
prior to the final decision of the Bank on interest rates , the call increased after an interest rate increased by inflation in hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy decision makers in July required an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation was reduced to 2.6 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected to re@@ dress it again in the coming months .
the Bank said the exceeding in relation to its target of 2 % is &quot; quite &quot; to be attributed to weak pounds .
Andrew Mont@@ i , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ ar Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent response of the s@@ wa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive , since the len@@ ders are looking forward to businesses looking forward in a positive way .
the market is especially good for those with existing De@@ als and closing the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with extra @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) aims to cont@@ end HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will benefit from September following a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one prior to the sexual intercourse was reduced by some 86 percent prior to sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of risk reduction in high risk analysis by around 86 percent , now from healthcare to the first three year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he was ready to fund the process after the Appeals Court confirmed a verdict of the Supreme Court ruling last year , under which the N@@ HS had paid the power to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
the last Thursday , announced on Thursday , was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) , which was the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first ones who will enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .
preced@@ ents ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicines that can be taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in infection risk .
pre@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication are present in the body of a person to prevent a HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to the treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners that were not successful .
in clinics , appropriate participants are identified to agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known due to anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and registered with a doctor may also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will receive £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the medication in this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by investigating clinical vou@@ chers , as it is used in large scale , targeted and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should expand the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent from HIV .
it is another milestone in which more than three decades continued progress in managing one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted for needy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is genu@@ in@@ ely controlled , and not with a negoti@@ ation with a partner is subject to improving many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority is to be done quickly throughout the country , and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left out .
now that the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test@@ medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ating execution .
the evidence shows how transformed this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transfer of these life @-@ changing infection can end .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the end of the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot;
life @-@ life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court Apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold it .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne said .
&quot; I was looking for something similar to my price .
in me , this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
originally a single bedroom property with a covered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to go into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne Stau@@ d@@ room and a mezzanine for optimal use of the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , a lot of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
to this end , they commissioned the architects and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , which was 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine which you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to resolve the submission .
&quot; the steel structure is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arranged to over@@ lap one another , without having to b@@ ail ourselves .
not only was to build a simple platform , but to make the steel so that it had the right height above or down the right height . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with plenty of additional drama .
for the mezzanine is a classic copper light from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us through the gl@@ am@@ orous lounge area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lights set the style to the program .
the use of s@@ ke@@ wers plays a role in adding theatres , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor can be mir@@ ro@@ red to take him longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance there are mir@@ ro@@ red sections for all the squares and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can unite the kitchen , if it is not used .
hing@@ ed kitchens are not new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a little bit of engineering went in , &quot; says Er@@ fan of the st@@ ahl@@ strengthened , fur@@ ni@@ ated MDF @-@ door .
&quot; it &apos;s so important that when you slide the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage room Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , a real estate agents will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground @-@ size . &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the ground surface and use high @-@ quality materials , which provide space to its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional ties in a home , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself in the electrical outlets in the walls .
they are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased size of a little standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could choose to leave this not .
brothers fight for a 500 million US @-@ dollar real estate empire
two decades of age are four decades after her Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation on one of the biggest real estate imperi@@ al Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its business can be divided .
Paul wanted to go back from the family business since 2014 but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties in value of more than half a billion dollars , and since the family purchased a store in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the family West@@ co Je@@ ans founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold to US $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her late father Colin - from Paul is described as &quot; main operators and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that Colin made property valued at € 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the allocation of real estate and cash has proved to be a pro@@ bl@@ ational point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , the inaug@@ ural hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday .
the brothers also fight for control of the existing business - including Colin , as Paul claims to have ruled him .
Colin has argu@@ ed that this is not true , but also raises Paul to manage some possessions .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to teach the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the law firm .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who run dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen products from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Bruns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
they used security to buy the coll@@ ages of Coll@@ ing@@ wood , in which Colin opened the first Je@@ ans@@ shop of the family .
Colin says he began to be West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hopes to pass on her property to her sons .
&quot; Luigi told me often that he never wanted to land before the court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not part of the De Lut@@ is business group , with Colin claimed that Mark paid $ 10 million in leaving the company $ 10 million and Luke 26 million .
both Luke and Mark are , &quot; Paul says &quot; had become bitter@@ ness about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin made himself very back though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography in 2015 , Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire became the best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took in touch with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
only Colin made his SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin made in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted me to say that Paul and I would say in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin .
Tr@@ um@@ ps , new Chief of Staff , plans to limit the Media Ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others tried it and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly is actually doing it .
if so , he will be the first .
PA@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump , including reports of news media - in hope to hold the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by journalist Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met his first working day with conducting employees , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wants to repair : bad information , which led into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in St@@ ings - because the president would make better choices if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ n@@ osis makes sense , but others tried to count Tr@@ ump by monitor his media device .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television is back for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; if a candidate stum@@ bled because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs , &quot; said the ex @-@ election advisor to Sam Nun@@ berg in February compared to POL@@ IT@@ ICO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it , according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it ever &quot; was under control &quot; is ridic@@ ulous .
perhaps this campaign officials do something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets should not contain more ignition material without their interventions .
we will probably never experience something about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump is not broadcast .
if his staff had made it a number of times , anger from it , then their effort was worthwhile .
but no one has consistently prevent it , that Tr@@ ump has prov@@ oked contro@@ versy .
part of the problem is that people have joined in a White House that are competing in competing parties , always trying to present their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump material that may enhance their views from the world .
Polit@@ ico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of counsel@@ ors , pre@@ sidents of strategic reasons .
this was an example described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump is able to react like a volcano on negative press releases , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he can find out how these origin@@ ate from .
it was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone responded to the President mal@@ icious , a copy of an article by Got@@ ap@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ alist Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a bun@@ ch of his Lec@@ ks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson was banned from sp@@ ik@@ es on Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that he expressed false demonstrations in the past , and rep@@ lied it .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking questions about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that then , then , Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper dump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his imp@@ ul@@ sive self , and his counsel@@ ors still stri@@ ve for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make the Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
M@@ eist@@ ed crimin@@ als get the postal service of Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the people will pray and hopes for the population .
the police in all over Europe shipped to dangerous crimin@@ als during this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
since the addresses of the requested heavy crimin@@ als are not known , however , indications from the population are hoping to pray and pray .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the promotion to the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; adv@@ ent calendar from winter .
the experience had shown that many vol@@ atile in holiday destinations hide , it was by Euro@@ pol .
we collected 21 postcards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed this site .
36 of the online collections could have been arrested , at least eleven of them due to the publication of the publication on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house owner of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some resol@@ ute trav@@ ellers on the foot of war , which have negotiated a drawn away from the church drawn from the church in order to demand a field in front of their Manor houses .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a box outside of a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies , and an army of tran@@ sports , after they had been kicked out in May , without being deported from a dig@@ ged by the arch@@ eological dig in order to prevent her accidents .
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed her vehicles through a section called un@@ impe@@ ded to find a track .
angry people pushed the advice of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went on Monday night after they were sent away from Bentley Heath , where they have thrown stones for the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced into action by switching to the problem , as it was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the travelers were there in May , were moved on and returned again .
last night more came to , probably still today . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to make a job by keeping long inter@@ mitt@@ ances in order to protect their parks .
I live without on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay even my toge@@ ther@@ ance if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot;
a resident who did not want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridic@@ ulous , we just have seen the last round of this traveler , just to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the figures have increased this time and they even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
a female speaker in the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and collabor@@ ating with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we seize the necessary legal steps so as fast as possible .
in order to support our wake @-@ up collection , it is very important that as many residents , a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police report , they call 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we submit our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is taken from the former hotel of Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on March 1 next year .
they are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof with the then @-@ ambi@@ ence operation company mbH took place on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays lost each year and also revenues by the local fee .
in autumn 2014 , in view of the rising numbers of refugees that came into the County , the property building was offered as a collection accommodation , provided for controversial discussions .
the town prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by the establishment of a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed in the community back then .
but above all , Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts Mayor of Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the time .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ gers with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ers , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the Group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ers and one in Bad Herren@@ chi@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been a long time building container in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will be clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made .
the floors were torn out , blank@@ ets for partly dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be re@@ done in the Black Forest style .
rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the entrance area will be re@@ designed , there will be new windows installed .
everything should become &quot; beautiful bourgeois , &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer puts out .
&quot; we want to make a je@@ wel . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
it does not place at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher inner city level , emphas@@ izes Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains .
individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men are supposed to feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause have he already led so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are identical to those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments was asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to set up exactly .
he reck@@ ons just under a million euros .
the exterior installations are also being placed on front@@ man , which is already visible .
in a courtyard a large terrace , which is open to the public , is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special E@@ vening The Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s affair concerning US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special issu@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
the panel recorded the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; with appeal to persons .
the newspaper evalu@@ ates the step as signs that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigation and intensi@@ fied .
the broad@@ caster CNN reported that the Committee of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps äl@@ test@@ y Son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have targeted targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were refer@@ ral between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign and Moscow .
there are several men in the focus of the investigations into the campaign as a consultant of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps , private and business environment among the magni@@ fying glass .
the Washington Post , &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the Sonder@@ er@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally wrote to the center and investigate whether the president in the context of the affair may have impe@@ ded the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
the main task of Grand Masters is to consider and decide whether the charge is to be charged .
Grand Le@@ y@@ ys are therefore also called the count of counts .
usually , they are switched on if there are bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure will always be closed behind closed doors .
furthermore , the Board can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to pre@@ charge persons under oath .
according to the broad@@ caster CNN , pre @-@ charges have been issued to turn the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement that was called in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ um@@ ps advisor and law @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ hner and his dam@@ sel@@ ess election boss Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the conversation .
right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday night in the US television that the en@@ forcement show that Mu@@ eller should not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that he should be necessary quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end , to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the en@@ forcement of the Gre@@ mi@@ um was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president used a speech in West Virginia in order to depic@@ t Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; Tr@@ ump said .
the topic give the Democrats a possibility to &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about them . &quot;
his custom consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a opinion that he did not know about the establishment of a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in the secret , he stressed .
the White House for@@ wards any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent to &quot; fa@@ ire &quot; ways .
former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not opposed to the president .
one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired .
because of this sc@@ ou@@ fs , Vor@@ um had become according to Tr@@ ump , and he wanted to impe@@ de the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump took him for a setting up investigations against the then national security adviser to Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under large pressure because of the study .
according to the representation of US media , the White House collected material against the Special @-@ medi@@ ator and its employees .
that triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump mu@@ eller wool wants .
unlike an independent special issu@@ er conference like Richard Nixon &apos;s Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Mu@@ eller sent a position in which he could be fired in theore@@ tically at the in@@ sist@@ ence of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republican and Democratic Sen@@ ators , on Thursday , bills are proposed , after which the special issu@@ ers could not be put out so easy .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ice mountain drives in Antarc@@ tica
in the western Arctic , a gigantic iron mountain has loos@@ ened from the cas@@ ket of the Sch@@ el@@ festiv@@ ity .
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the more than one trillion tonne of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres large col@@ oss drive now to the north and will probably have two , three years until it is melted .
it is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest king@@ doms of the researchers have registered in the last three decades .
a risk for people is not from him .
to what extent the climate change has played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice r@@ ink , after research is un@@ clear .
in total , however , there has been a series of unusual mer@@ g@@ ging of iron in the region for around 30 years , the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) writes in an invo@@ icing background .
according to many researchers , it could be related to global warming .
the broken @-@ down Kol@@ oss was now a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ bow .
Sch@@ el@@ festiv@@ ities swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ bow is located south of South America nearly on the top of the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ hoe the equilibrium of wa@@ xes and ab@@ ort was disturbed some years ago .
a complete ch@@ ub@@ el@@ ous is to be broken there , writes A@@ WI @-@ Resear@@ cher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there are some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ bow is in danger also , because the front edge of the Cannon was never so far withdrawn , as at present .
in addition , the ice @-@ sla@@ b stand under stress and can be disin@@ t@@ egr@@ ated if there is a piece of keys .
the melting of cock@@ ro@@ co@@ ols and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level not as they swim on water and ice as much water as it would melt after the melt itself .
however , the loss of the sh@@ ing@@ circle causes the glacier to go into the sea directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only in small dimensions , the British research project on observation of the Antarc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) writes .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ festiv@@ ity is the fourth biggest of the Antarc@@ tic in accordance with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge of the free ocean some 200 metres .
there breaks it regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural , and we have no direct link to climate change , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the start of records , &quot; he also confirmed .
among scientists should be controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ co@@ ols come back again and possibly fall apart , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though this researcher did not lead the demol@@ ition of this gigantic ice hill to climate change , so in recent decades , many king@@ f@@ ice of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula have broken .
this long skir@@ t on Antarc@@ tica stretches towards South America .
according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the reduction in temperature increases .
the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has been heated by around three degrees during the past 50 years and t@@ aming the areas in which the temperature is fastest .
CDU wants the building tariff at the personnel
because it is becoming more difficult to fill @-@ free spots , the CDU out of the employers association , to become more attractive .
during the summer break , the chal@@ k falls in 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have already completed their first working day .
the apprenti@@ ces in the circle are apparently very des@@ irable .
approximately 620 applications were available for the couple of places this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still missing staff to tackle the increased requirements and tasks .
at present , the circle M@@ ett@@ mann is at present , just as 50 not occupied places .
among other things , doctors and engineers are looking for the general administration .
the CDU wants to join the F@@ DP together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG , and join the department of skilled workers in the administration .
the administration should be &quot; a concept for the personnel promotion , personnel development , &quot; according to the request of the parties . &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term admir@@ ation of professionals , but forward to the future oriented of the candidate short@@ age .
the overall concept should be oriented according to the internal and extern@@ ally oriented actions aimed at cross @-@ level measures and include a check @-@ in action , demand for CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds already a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems , which one never knew so .
other cities advert@@ ise good officials and employees , offering more attractive terms .
the speech is marked by a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
this comes to a high number of employees , sickness , or age @-@ condition@@ ally from the service .
so the highest time to act , so that no longer vac@@ an@@ cies remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter &apos;s people , the leader of the CDU , joined the party with his party .
he looked un@@ long already in the cra@@ ck@@ day for a fat @-@ rather surprise when he questioned the staff co@@ als publicly and the remaining parties contra@@ cted .
people want all possibilities to be checked , enabling a exit from the municipal employers association .
&quot; if we don &apos;t arrive at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the county administration should be in cooperation with the trade unions - maybe even in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated cities , &quot; So peoples .
this means the CDU , employees , and officials to pay better when it is actually looking for the public service for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , increases or more money there is only if you move into a higher level , which are oriented toward professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute &apos;s law .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone of NGO @-@ mig@@ rant life@@ jack@@ ets
Italy has NGOs to deplo@@ y the life boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue in new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Minister of Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
Min@@ n@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German aid agency &apos; Youth R@@ ings &apos; because their crew had worked effective with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that the illegal immigration had been lighten@@ ed .
the aid organisation , which has been operating only since a year , rejected it from exec@@ uting the Italian state of Ambro@@ gio carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; for us , the salvation of the human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we can not operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media .
&quot; we can judge all accus@@ ations , which currently can be judged , only after we collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ager &apos; , which was supervised by the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a .
it is thought that his crew will take hose @-@ boat migrants , which can be delivered directly from traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can continue , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one of these meetings took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected to prevail over the authority of the Italian coast guards , the rescue plan in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves are taken away .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have aboard a Italian police officer , who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been declared to date up to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS of Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter spoke on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily but acceptable , since it would not be any &quot; essential amendments or disability &quot; of their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy came back in the past few weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and the cooperation with the local masters of fruit .
&quot; in recent days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister .
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month over economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali , on measures to reduce number of migrants who left these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berliner out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights for four days .
there were three kept Gu@@ ides for this .
the accommodation at the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Feld turned out to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures across the vineyards on Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
they followed observation points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ camp@@ ed planes .
there was always a longer rise , for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the popular Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again look@@ out point to view point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate approach .
during the last two days , many ups were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and cottages brought down breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the Bik@@ ers in the open @-@ air conditioning system at@@ m@@ ated .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest of his best side - spor@@ tive and cul@@ tur@@ ally .

fact : e @-@ Sport has long been to an increasing business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high G@@ agen included .
these are also the first federal government , which are increasingly recognized in this field .
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , which started in 2015 , followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to inspire all new young targets for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the President of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is surely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup Football Club organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; at which gam@@ ers will compete in various clubs .
beside Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the explosion @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile an agency for virtual football player .
&quot; real football must deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people still walk into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 year @-@ old .
and , the clubs , all possible markets , especially the Asian , were to conquer .
with prominent e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , one could only be present online more often on these markets than once in the year the federal government will send to Asia .
why is it exactly ?
at the e @-@ sport computer games such as &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike , &quot; or the football @-@ simulation of the FIFA World Cup FIFA will be negotiated .
long ago , as in normal sport , Li@@ ves established that the pros will compete against each other .
and in the Asia Pacific , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the imagination is certainly acc@@ ust@@ omed .
in too , In@@ go F@@ rob@@ y has dealt with the issue for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is competent and showed many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classic sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
furthermore , there are cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers shouldn &apos;t only exercise to the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the fin@@ ed player is a good player . &quot;
but the bad thing also looks a problem : &quot; d@@ oping is always a subject . &quot;
checks are hard @-@ managed at online games , and in the scene failed the structures of classic sports .
the scientists have a positive effect on the emin@@ ent effect of E @-@ Sports .
players are on the way around the world , which is like a great global family , there are no inter@@ cultural int@@ entions .
a study of the corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte , and the Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says to the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , more than 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly advertis@@ ements , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , revenue is to be 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
international are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the U.S. , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez takes part in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .

there are some things in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a class , says F@@ rob@@ ber .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ first league clubs are in the meantime , in the meantime , committed to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany , &quot; says V@@ f@@ B @-@ Managing Director R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old times to clari@@ fy , is not enough anymore .
it is why the company preser@@ ves the tradition of the association , but it is setting out the company at the same time .
&quot; we live in a dig@@ iti@@ ful world , &quot; he also says .

Michelle Carter for the lyrics , causing Conrad Roy to suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on prob@@ ation .
Carter was sentenced in June for neg@@ ligent hom@@ icide of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to stay free to appeal .
she was confron@@ ted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives went on to argue that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ use , Carter stand there with tears in his eyes , folded and down @-@ facing eyes when they were condemned .
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the lawyer &apos;s lawyer .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; it has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; aw@@ ful revolution which they are un@@ fortunate . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their mental disease has a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a public prosecutor , a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , said that there is no one day when I did not catch the loss of my beloved son .
I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain@@ s that we will carry with us forever , for his sisters there , &quot; that is in it .
Ro@@ ys Sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they have never been persecuted by the realization &quot; that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a real preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , that makes it a crime to challenge another , comm@@ itting suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters &apos;s text messages revealed that they had encouraged him to complete his life .
&quot; hanging up , spring from a building , ste@@ eping yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent them in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the sight of his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad , &quot; and &quot; Everything that you must do is to turn the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
to the few who have defended Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder on her British collabor@@ ator in Italy before she was acquitted on two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter won compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ed : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as captain , is not a coincidence .
FC Bayern tru@@ sts the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner for a big season - does not harm extra motivation .
anything was different at his place in the cabin , that was Joshua K@@ imm@@ ed immediately , even if the extra piece was very , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , there was no Philipp lam@@ m and no Manuel new to see , he joined the arm in his arm .
&quot; the coach did not have announced , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner was back after his first deployment as a Bavaria @-@ captain .
well , the one could have better run than at the 0 : 2 versus the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach could also suggest that .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen out of youth chess players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the holiday passed by the C @-@ El@@ f as a player .
the sugar , one is most commonly found to those who want to hold a good mood in La@@ une .
those who have been exp@@ elled to race the L@@ ame of L@@ ame , can only use a little extra motivation .
K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player wants to take over responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old attracted a mini @-@ lame on the field .
right behind , that is now its position , the white Bin@@ de at the arm did their rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich worked as the one that can take the rest in the hand as well .
he gave instructions to direct the trou@@ pe trou@@ pe .
he had a view of the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
V@@ idal therefore , his missing fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ dable hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus making up on the top of the services of the Asia Pacific ( fol@@ dable also only condition@@ ally ) , and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not stop neg@@ atively in their first performance in the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
all that worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran beside K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both ag@@ ulated .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm did difficult , in addition , Sü@@ ver tried to successfully tested a few times in the play @-@ building .
his colleague Rud@@ y had the fact that the result was &quot; not the case , as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance in the debut .
reproduction , temp@@ o changes : &quot; I was also fet@@ ched for this style . &quot;
as usual , this Bavaria @-@ world is still looking for new access to the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , gave the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed after a few cr@@ isp@@ y statements on his new player &apos;s back .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what &apos;s going on , I already noticed .
with Bavaria , you must just win each game . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new one more .

often it was often un@@ reconc@@ iled , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still an economic Minister of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year , in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .

Audi should change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers are confron@@ ted with a counter@@ action
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software to more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
the BMW @-@ President said the fact that &quot; there is more intelligent options as a driving limit , &quot; and thus the company moved to European cities , including Munich where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to provide or restri@@ cting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a rep@@ ay@@ ment .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the observ@@ ance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are regarded as carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , plants for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles to install out exhaust gases , also assume what it is difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful auto companies and ignor@@ ing the problem of the problem .
the company try to avoid mistakes of Volkswagen that could be used to regulate the use of so @-@ called sequence of components to regulate the provisions if a car was tested , but at normal conditions .
several employees were charged in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be filed in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities have accused of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions requirements in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be heavily loaded by Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes decis@@ iv@@ ely to the gain of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los cr@@ ushing and laugh@@ ing against suffering ,
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most widely published cartoon animations , the cre@@ ases of his figures are his trademark .
even with 85 , the Argent@@ inian man even works and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants .
in the first years as an artist , he was among others , as a drawing for lucky tickets - what fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the 1960s , he succeeded in breakthrough : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again the artist was inspired by the artists .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures m@@ ugs in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
the early morning , according to his own information , he also still sits on the drawing day , works almost ten hours a day .
about Calendar , Pu@@ zzles , Books for Gross and Small , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches are still finding a lot of spread world wide .
for six years he also works on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures .
the main character in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thou@@ sand@@ d@@ driver as counter@@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is to come to the movie screen in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they are saying , it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o .
the script will not be written by him .
this is why he is rather set on the TV series , which is produced as its original drawings , wor@@ r@@ essly produced .
lavender Lav@@ ender from Provence by Climate Change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lavender is decreasing because of the conditions that are borne due to d@@ rought conditions and , due to the imp@@ ur@@ ent insects , which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , create great heada@@ ches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the agricultural research firm CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to impacts of climate change in recent years , much more rain in spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the life of lavender .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that carries the d@@ warf @-@ cla@@ des , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
lavender oil is not only attracted to holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; rather than having a long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either weak@@ ened or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered into account are a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing down of the surface , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water , and the development of varieties , which are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Ge@@ isa in the th@@ ang@@ ing@@ ian rat is celebrating its 1,200 year anniversary this year .
holding up point is closed on Saturday and Sunday with a middle age .
merchants , ignition , tra@@ ders , vag@@ ant or a land camp should be experienced in these days at the downtown .
the Ass@@ assin@@ ation of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of Weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wed@@ nes@@ days to review their plans for reporting the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ce@@ able drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children to the office , which were the target of a attack with gren@@ ades , or leave them at home in 2009 .
security experts wrote three words on a plaque at the fore@@ front of the room : opponent , Neut@@ r@@ ale , allies .
they ask the rep@@ orters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to submit perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal cav@@ ity .
there are drug vendors , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand at the beh@@ est list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that will make the chaos of Mexico .
there are no rest periods of violence , and throughout the country the bodies are frequent : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 have been standing for attacks and threats from federal and up to now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is its editors and its inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his many books on violence related to drugs .
his lack is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hang@@ s on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two rep@@ orters in the Thir@@ ty Years , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , bear t @-@ shirts , who show his smile face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ anian .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the reporter discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ epl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special prosecutor was set up in 2010 to process the inst@@ ances of journalists , it was led to the Committee to protect journalists only by two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murders that are linked to drug dealers and organised crime each year , the kill@@ ers of journalists will only be tried by journalists .
in Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still consist of treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ separ@@ able , although the Ter@@ rain is now even more aci@@ di@@ fied .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting regarding the discussion of safety is little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid , to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we susp@@ end everybody . &quot;
in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced on two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; 12th River . &quot;
the arch@@ ing drove in his car and damaged it close .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but regarding Val@@ dez , there is practically no silence on Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s arrest in January and the extradition of the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the country &apos;s blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , because rival fac@@ tions strug@@ gles to fill the vacuum .
it makes no matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot dead on the street or that the cemetery is full of emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug users who are larger than many homes for the living .
forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm , &quot; if only a cart@@ el takes control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work is Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the blame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
in February the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the rival of competition in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this release may have dis@@ sc@@ and@@ alized the sons , transmission members bought each copy of the output as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake had not been to force Val@@ dez , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same history to leave the country on its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues took that he would always be there .
he was in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined with five colleagues at the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 USD investments .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without pun@@ c@@ turing the smoking problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
with the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of the cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and the turnover and advertising took place .
rep@@ orters loved it to release hard tre@@ sp@@ icious examinations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by an publication that no one else could deal with stories .
she received eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors &quot; Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursu@@ it of Mexican drug history , wherever they did .
he gave himself up voluntarily , that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J .
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; said he in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October of October .
&quot; you have to take over the task that fall@@ out to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do about so many dead ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce @-@ team is missing Val@@ dez , the fun bird that was flu@@ x like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the boy@@ friend who was generous with h@@ ugs and coun@@ selling , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go there and sit there at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine to be a routine ?
his death had also forced to ask her own imp@@ ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do their work best and stay alive in the life .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start@@ - and landing ways , &quot; to make drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ sh@@ at@@ ts and self @-@ maintaining .
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cies .
if it sm@@ ells un@@ true , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of the o@@ zo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell a meaning that can be deceived was ... and then the matter is happening with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where employees met by Ri@@ odo@@ ce to security training , suddenly no cell phones are allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware that was sold exclusively to governments , used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in joke , some of the Rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who described the governor himself as a tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago since the reporter had gone into the mountain landscape , where drug users are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has rock@@ ed on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother &apos;s brother Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to state spending , focusing on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Office of Office , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about it , who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite locally by drug dealers and authorities .
a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who li@@ stens to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) which ruled nearly all the century all political levels .
several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real beg@@ ged the reporter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; did not escape a military attack .
just a few months ago , the readers had the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; in former times , we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slender body composition .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the Val@@ dez Office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers , which protest against the murders of journalists , because the staff had become something that they never would have expected - activists in the name of the press .
replica Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration for another journalist for the Office of the Office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
journalists became stronger in the country by having settled in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on obe@@ dience and construction .
on that day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez was gone in Washington and tried to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to sp@@ atter journalists and release them because they have told the truth .
she has since then asked that it is divided into the government by the government , because it is concerned that their anger has hurt its objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists gathered in Mexico by organised crime , involved in government officials and a valid society . &quot;
in his final book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that reporter can not only be killed by drugs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces , which were st@@ aked in organised crime under a ceiling .
the &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; group has more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials last year .
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want to hold the mouth , &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said .
obviously the murders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
nobody forget the death of the Blo@@ g@@ ation Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as at the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones were separated from their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , following the assassination of the correspon@@ dents MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do how El Man@@ ana von Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assassination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez addressed the drug files with an Editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists escaped from their home country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes it is ch@@ ased , as evi@@ den@@ ced by the photographer Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in a home in Mexico with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay back and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , announces that drug dealers are troubled .
&quot; Mexico goes to Hell , and therefore I became reporter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition had already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce was sitting on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones started to sw@@ apping .
a series of sh@@ ot@@ ies with rib@@ bed belts and security forces near the sea of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 dead bodies .
the war continues , as promised by a series of cart@@ el em@@ bassies in the region .
from the on @-@ board ship , they published news on the web site by Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are near - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers , who held guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show them .
under the enormous portrait of the founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the people of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; how can you just remember , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day when Javier has been murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to so@@ ften his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a terri@@ fying .
now , researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his created skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they &apos;d have had something of a &quot; in@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the dead Din@@ osau@@ rs , who has ever been found , and one of the best Din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has researchers to describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the inherited vegetable her@@ e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Shawn Radio , when he arrived at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium on March 21 , 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , dug .
he met on something that appeared from the surrounding rock at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to look closer .
the fossil discovered by him in the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) of heavy soil .
after all this hard work , the finished outcome is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with the eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible .
&quot; it will go to scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - Mon@@ a Lisa is the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this vegetable her@@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with a arm@@ our and resem@@ bles a walk @-@ like tank , probably managed by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide in pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ ute technology that is also known as counter@@ f@@ att@@ ening , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to ex@@ pose yourself into its surroundings and explo@@ it his enemies , experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creation from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now able to see the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technicians Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of specimen made it possible with Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ aments about his body .
they discovered the sha@@ dy , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the conv@@ ection is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds the animals today .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by a sufficient pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the deteri@@ oration of con@@ frontation would be the means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the conv@@ ection - think of Re@@ he , Zeb@@ ras or ni@@ b@@ ans - are much smaller and inj@@ uri@@ ous than lo@@ ot , what signals that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real battle for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , strong mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous have to have been , &quot; Brown said .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r bay was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on hints about his life , including his final Dar@@ min@@ ate to find out what it served as his final meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , came into a river and pushed into the sea , where it sank to the sea .
at that time Alberta were as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it has been completely covered with con@@ stri@@ ped skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of animal life , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous .
you do not need a lot of imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you only feel a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous was a time when giant le@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , passed the earth .
although the King of them , Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , lived millions of years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his horri@@ ble ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 @-@ foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , their latest findings in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sank after the death in the sea and in mud .
the creature was found by Shawn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium , near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , dug .
according to the museum , it is the preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely destroyed by the mu@@ zzle up to the hip .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch sp@@ ik@@ es that ra@@ pped from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the mo@@ red plant her@@ e@@ aters were sw@@ amped through the western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater ascent of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the rem@@ nants of this particular specimen are so good that the Hau@@ ste still hol@@ lows down cur@@ b plates along the din@@ osau@@ r dam
as Michael G@@ resh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preser@@ vation is so rare as a win in lot@@ tery .
the more I know it , the better let it come .
the remains of the skin remains still the hol@@ low@@ ly tank plates that wear the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed it up .
I can count the she@@ ds at his sole . &apos;
in the thunder@@ storm : massage ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
hot accident on Thursday night on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass amb@@ ol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles long st@@ out - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the late Thursday afternoon of the Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , some 20 people died on the late Thursday afternoon .
according to the first information of the police , at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the airports of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Landkreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , during a thunder@@ storm , some 30 vehicles , including trucks , were probably also trucks .
initially , there were no information regarding the exact number of injured parties .
it was mild to moderate injuries , said a polic@@ eman .
a large number of b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was on the accident site .
the A8 is completely closed in Munich .
in the direction of Munich a roughly ten kilometres of retreat was formed .
as a A@@ Z reporter reported , there was also a massive han@@ dicap - through numerous G@@ aff@@ s .
the fire@@ fighters noted the trademarks of the vehicle le@@ vers , which now have to count with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock the second accident happened on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .

Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting in turn and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ens in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes from the workflow and ar@@ ouses a impro@@ per or ri@@ ps the bike in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of inter@@ ru@@ ptions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the most reliable driving position control .
you simply confirm your place by mobile , that you have taken his seat , so that the ticket may be taken .
currently , one test mode runs on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , as we extend it .
it is expected to be available at many other traffic routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a train nar@@ ration .
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the rail links without a job .
in order to use it , however , some requirements need to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what is going to do for most passengers already .
it also has to be bought by rail , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works : you get into the train , calling its ticket below &quot; My tickets . &quot;
the test customers then appears a button to get the electronic validation .
the train station received a message on their mobile devices that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located on the train and the booked seating area Y .
comes along with driver control at place Y , it knows that there is a passenger with already inde@@ xed online ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , continue to remain silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which is to use the passengers .
&quot; who simply wants to travel without ticket control by our train station personnel , check the DB Navigator software itself .
this allows the passengers to design their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of DB Remote traffic .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
those who often go railway , knows that beside del@@ ays and missed trains , the ticket checks are among the biggest sleeves .
because often , one of the fellow travelers do not have all documents in any case , which one needs for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you must indicate .
the result are endless discussions between train station and ride , which leads to bad mood in the gate or large space and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and takes care of the works at the end time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart food .
additional access numbers on the same track are not enabled .
how an activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to her core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , St. Louis was born on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b @-@ apartment , which she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from High School .
&quot; the police had just killed just a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street . &quot; he named him there .
confused when nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed on their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the St. Louis region was there , death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed in a twe@@ et .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was out@@ stretched on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; thought to herself .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she gave her mobile phone to return to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive later on the evening .
there were photos of the police tape and people , who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be Bro@@ wns &apos;s father , who carried a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of protest@@ ers with a rebellious dog .
in another video , she said , assured another polic@@ eman his rif@@ le and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell rec@@ alled its statement .
&quot; that is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and which we can call it typical . &quot;
at this moment , I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she repeated her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided to drive the two next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinemas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell ran with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a matching crown , the two will have a conversation , which they had inn@@ um@@ erable times before this morning &quot; on the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; do you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; she remin@@ ded of what she said .
&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police has killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that was not right .
I could not take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it needs to know and see it and be re@@ ared .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vism and organisation but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do in order to free us .
even if I &apos;m lucky , you have experienced an experience in which they do not experience any serious rac@@ ism , it is no different than the next black Women &apos;s child .
I feel , I would give you a poor service to keep them off . &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp@@ ground , as the activists waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter associated with a local business partner who had lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass on protest@@ ers .
slowly began to accept a new type of acti@@ vism for fermentation .
&quot; my acti@@ vism has changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ ur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black commun@@ es .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar realized only &quot; what happened .
a question came to the sense : &quot; would you be document@@ ing or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this scep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by people from people , often from the White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an explained recently in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised up their voices have not been cent@@ ered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had co @-@ collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vism on his acti@@ vism .
the project gave birth to Fer@@ rell , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after the gener@@ osity .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; Davis .
&quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are depicted , because I will be depicted . &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ gh@@ s &apos;s experience - to show that it is in motion &quot; not for a Messiah who comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant of the film .
as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rowing &apos;s life as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be some vulnerable during this work and in the creation of black people . &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rell@@ s history repe@@ ats the role of the black gay women in the wider black @-@ lives match movement .
two of the three founders of movement , who have marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter , &quot; in social media in 2012 , identi@@ fying himself as a gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are fighting on different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women have to carry out the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement was really held in black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in the fermentation of their identity as the heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok her energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s not a coincidence , even though it was at the front of the front , because there is a lot of life in these cl@@ ashes as a black , gay woman is so much on the stake .
you can sense your energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the r@@ att@@ est links between the community and police have continued to exist .
fermentation is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social and political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she slow@@ ed at a singing and she feels committed to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the road three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another , and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - save our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; up to &quot; size &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the South of the pedestrian zone has been ob@@ sol@@ ete since the first time in 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
the theme hardly can be cold .
this topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one @-@ bit gallery said : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; This would be a real class &quot; ( Nicole Gi@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi bats ) or quite simply : &quot; magn@@ itude ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the advoc@@ ates insi@@ sted that a gallery will attract more customers into the city , from which other businesses are benef@@ ited , fear the enemy that then the pedestrian zone has bleeding .
added : the gallery will be foc@@ uss@@ ed on the premises on which the farmers market stands , offering 13 direct marketing products to its products .
the construction work will be concluded with the start of the construction work .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - as a place to sit outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we &apos;ve been selling almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm is always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that even during and above all , after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether you are direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , arrives at the height of the rent .
but the new project will probably not be low . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the most shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dro@@ pping or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
you see how many shops are vac@@ ated here - some have been for months and years .
however , since there is not even a regular weekend market , it is the more important that at least the market stands remains .
because after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly directly from the producer and is ob@@ struc@@ tible priced .
as you see , shop businesses are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the dor@@ m mi@@ ds are often not portable for a reta@@ iler .
it &apos;s a pity , special transactions there is almost no more and what is left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a Mark@@ thalle fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market go round during the construction period ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even in duration if the bit @-@ gallery soon arrives .
or does it make the Sp@@ ect@@ st Bit Gallery already to distribute all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just doesn &apos;t work .
and shopping center that stands empty , nobody needs .
according to my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real estate market instead of this gallery .
but for a peas@@ ant hall , it &apos;s quite a place thanks to the mad many - how to find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .
when the P@@ eas@@ ant hall is captured , a piece of culture will van@@ ish . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : an artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the center of the fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , that are almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous - that hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg made from che@@ eks and hair sections created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence service analy@@ st banned a 35 @-@ year sentence after having admitted to the secret diplom@@ acy reporting on behalf of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August , means A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( Ano@@ ther simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspon@@ dent between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline moved their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and a pioneering discretion , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that could be extracted from the 30 portraits , such as some intellectual comment not only about the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born in Bradley Edward , but has been convicted by the identification as a woman , was convicted in 2013 because of 20 charges , among them six violations of the spy law , computer fraud and theft .
because of the prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only a single photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde speaking with which she has been associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strange arti@@ facts such as cigarette st@@ ills and che@@ wing gum by extra@@ cting the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
this was the time when they received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg on a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t visit this time and she couldn &apos;t be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ equal letters , which , in the course of two years , letters pl@@ ain@@ ted several letters .
they even created a comic book published by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o illustr@@ ate a comic strip published by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , who would be a future fore@@ seen in which the President of Chel@@ i@@ qu@@ ake would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was indeed just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome way of happy meetings .
there are also now at the opening of the exhibition something deeper and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find the rigid divisions which he should actually fix to fl@@ aming .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen out of a particular reason . &quot;
in a description of the gallery written by the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for &quot; Mann@@ ing with its super@@ v@@ ent signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in its family name ) has been an end of the &quot; automatic crash issues whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is the mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ ing of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hopes that the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) show how surprising , at least in biological ways we all are .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring to what is that our gen@@ ome does not take care of who we are and like openly genetic data for an interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video production of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is one page from the mentioned Comic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing as she appears with a Fre@@ is@@ pre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ one in hand from the discipl@@ ines of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; when they declare your word in cold , then they have won , &quot; says it .
&quot; keep never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia .
&quot; I &apos;m still getting ge@@ ese , when I speak of it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing had not seen the exhibition personally - as it was fore@@ seen in the comic book - but when they should do it , it will be welcomed in the center of the space of the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic Sim@@ ul@@ ak@@ ren , who gather themselves together like hor@@ des of Protest@@ ers .
it was also aimed at the same time as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ sack was written with pencil .
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that deals with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and a employee of the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide human hunting is under way for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who as susp@@ ects has been sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday the arrest warran@@ ts for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued warran@@ ts for murder of her alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acquisition of the Cook &apos;s Local Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several bul@@ lets .
a general warning system , published by the Chicago Police authority , revealed that the ly@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , coming to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the site of the event , and det@@ ective exam@@ ines the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects .
L@@ ath@@ em has been associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. cub@@ an , the vice @-@ president for the university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that L@@ ath@@ em has now been in@@ doors and ruled by the University of North@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal issue which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University collabor@@ ates on this investigation , &quot; Cub@@ bage .
War@@ ren is Senior Management Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK , and ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ators in every conc@@ ei@@ vable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to put himself up .
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he demands the susp@@ ects of the susp@@ ects .
&quot; the police has an idea of their place , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that in the apartment 10@@ 08 was something happened .
the police described the scene as a very cruel man .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident happened on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the sacrifice of a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim , and explo@@ res a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will shut off the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said that it won &apos;t last long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for restoration of Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and testing in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA @-@ tim@@ etable has been updated in this respect , &quot; Mut@@ ko declared on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could give concern for Russia occasion .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities allowed the approval of the WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly owned government sponsored d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports .
in terms of the matter , mut@@ ko says : &quot; we conduct the study because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has put an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that exists . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os recorded words with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales agency R@@ Sports at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v was problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
nobody has failed to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping sk@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA by implementing D@@ oping control in Russia .
you were allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the organisation of the organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ Director Olivier Nig@@ gl@@ i declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved into the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di sold not only eggs more
these were shared the business groups .
it is a pure pre@@ conception , it could continue to be prec@@ eded by no health imp@@ air@@ ment , it was reported in the message .
from now only eggs are supposed to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been tested negative for fi@@ anc@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ les@@ ions .
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency to its customers .
the start@@ ups that will help your business will not become the next ure@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start@@ up , but the p@@ olls didn &apos;t work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the trial .
&quot; just never gave consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ rett , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed .
she sum@@ mon@@ ed people from outside to help .
a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is on wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
due to the preparation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee involvement , it enables companies to offer surveys , special groups and demo@@ graphic groups to deal with employees An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity and complaint @-@ hot@@ lines , and in some cases , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow the C @-@ suite managers to deal directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you have now tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment .
Er@@ rett said that she has better viewing into what your employees think and won in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ p@@ olls and p@@ olls of certain teams , it provides a high heat card of the company which shows the majority of the complaints and which executives have low degree results - so that you can im@@ pose why .
companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture , you do not have to be the next U@@ ber , which has been published in sc@@ and@@ als since then a former staff has published a blog post , which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , with those who have been spoken , punished .

Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , will be used to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report an issue , he or she had to find a number or email for corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .

&quot; and we are protecting our shareholders in case of employment lit@@ igation . &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen interrupted with the Enron sc@@ andal caused by Enron sc@@ andal , said quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring of ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as services , and don &apos;t load the companies with recur@@ ring charges for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors , which also supports both start@@ ups .
converting was received $ 10 million at funding in February by firms like Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the whole capital was raised to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer &apos;s partner , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex in research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than so far .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high levels of sal@@ aries and interesting projects are just w@@ agers .
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and estimated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s happy to be in a company , and that the work you do is worth , then they feel more strongly committed to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , which will be used as well as G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach r@@ end@@ ings if their portfolio business is well running . companies run well if employees are involved and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics tools promise third party , commitment and deployment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on the employee &apos;s commitment after the experts of the workplace culture is important .
however , the data are us@@ eless when the Administrator of a company take no measures .
in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it can have a expect@@ ation that change is on the way .
and if the change isn &apos;t fast enough , or at all , this dis@@ appointments and employees can motiv@@ ate them .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 ideas , you must be willing to have 4,000 interviews , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company that can rely on collecting data .
&quot; for if you do not follow , &quot; Do you really hear me ? &quot;
do you care about that ?
and if you do not care about why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who passes the p@@ its of the monthly staff p@@ olls , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t as you do .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to re @-@ organize more teams within the business and to add several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday the company always receives new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector that is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood @-@ ins
it starts at 23 : 00 when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ers are on one side of the new exercise fields of the team in the campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ usually minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are inscri@@ bed in the summer courses will return to their final tests after the 3 @-@ hour practice before they return to the water football Center next morning at 6 : 30 PM .
&quot; for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ k mill , &quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a said shortly before the Monday was on Tuesday .
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has effectively extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 will start to meet the players already completed .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood @-@ ins post@@ pon@@ ed during the last season almost a week after the last season , during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood .
they will conclude at the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of formal preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said he will support the rule of N@@ CAA , even if they add another point @-@ up routes to the players .
&quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; and they just pushed it , they plac@@ er continue , they are great people .
I think once we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will stop their practices as soon as the camp is finished , what is being thrown at the clear branch of its fields of an adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the upper class that has already cleared a protective cover behind a tor@@ p@@ ist , no easy task will be .
brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem , once this room are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; it is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that the people rent a room there and then you can choose to record a exercise .
if you have the video of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I do not really worry about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counterfeit News
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterfeit messages sent by third parties and their results under the original contribution , then the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake News .
the company said in an opinion on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to recognise possible detection messages , which may indicate the results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main divi@@ ding points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .
the problem is also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were flooded with false stories in May , and Germany should not succeed a plan to era@@ dic@@ ate the social media networks as they did not manage to remove h@@ ass@@ fulfilled postal ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday Facebook spoke in a separate explanation on German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of new facts can be launched .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fact checked out the third parties , people want more context to meet spar@@ sely decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara , Product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
it added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; associated article &quot; and in other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze @-@ music video and was for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 @-@ he was a si@@ p@@ ush@@ ch .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his comfortable sitting in the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now the inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I think it &apos;s so beautiful to look at the signature of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac Las@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ gh@@ y May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expect@@ edly found emotional .
&quot; I have only respon@@ ding to the Dau@@ men@@ ab@@ druck at the side of a letter which was written by a double player in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his Dau@@ men@@ ab@@ druck !
and letters always smell as smoke , because at that time one burnt fire due to the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect than it would be for himself .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who has been beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and has lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I took my welcome dig a little over &quot; ) it seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , like the mounted hy@@ m@@ ns on the walls and the bottles that spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emigrated to the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with farm care , gar@@ dening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , he drank , he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was first received the full access in 2006 than the last one , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats spoke &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps that pose what had : &quot; you could mean that land @-@ conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let all go their gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base to look at a bro@@ ader base in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the peas@@ ant farm began in this area and I thought a insur@@ rection was a good start .
perhaps the two connected to each other ? &quot;
other stories are ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , telling the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , the family hid seven years long during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , portra@@ yed in the Egyptian Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , filled his own bur@@ ial by filled a s@@ ard@@ ine with stones ( a discovery that was only dug for years later than his Sar@@ g was dug out ) .
the Dar@@ rell@@ s are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen appeared to be fitting , always turn debts and spend money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell men sol@@ es their debt crisis by giving rich elderly women - I present them as a he@@ ap of fine @-@ looking boys , with a talent to advert@@ ise land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rho@@ des in search of other unique write experiences
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ dges , the grounds of a san@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which has then returned from nature again .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
it was like this : &quot; Oh , now I must be finished with the condemned life . &quot;
a campaign launched : over 300 years old Lady chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ bo@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has launched its campaign for the introduction of a new roof brand ( Rundschau from Thursday ) .
even until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team have to hold the logo and its slogan for his marketing team .
at the end of August , it will be a highlight of the campaign on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; to be nice for us .
or ? , &quot; the makers of Action have been on posters since yesterday at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; we do not think ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they are registered on their web site yesterday .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and in order to make clear that some is better than it seems .
in essence , we are the firm conviction that we considered as bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens around the beauty and attra@@ cti@@ veness of our city very well . &quot;
with the action , it &apos;s more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it continues .
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single standing ple@@ dge , one that gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
a mid @-@ digit amount can be found by the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f as their new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) cons@@ its about retirement and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
this is how this week .
on the first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish dispute a year after the coup attempt .
the session took place no longer in the building of the general Staff , as previously , but in the prime minister of the Prime Minister .
on the deliber@@ ations under the leadership of the government , the five Vice Premier@@ s , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
in this way , civilians were killed in the Y@@ as .
the government forces the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were removed .
since the failed coup , Prime Minister Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ a since the failed coup .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of con@@ current connections to the move of the exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wire of the put@@ sch attempt .
4@@ 86 people who were allegedly involved in the put@@ sch attempt , will have been negotiated there in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan has designated a &quot; divine present &quot; as he had given him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but has Erdo@@ gan really touched the army ?
in late February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort &quot; in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
at the general Staff , there are concerns because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which manifest themselves among other things in the lifting of head ban for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , the newspaper wrote .
anyway , the great cleaning case in the army and the security forces goes on .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan introduced another 73@@ 95 police officers , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed , when Erdo@@ gan is t@@ amed the military .
gener@@ als were earlier than the actual lords of the country .
she colle@@ cts th@@ rice three times , calling for her role as a guard of the world@@ ly State Code .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan urged the power of the military to step back , not least for the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is managing director of armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a previously @-@ called officer , who was seeking asylum after the coup attempt in foreign countries abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and o@@ af@@ ists &quot; in few years .
that is true , however , that NATO might not aband@@ on Nato .
anyway , there is doubts in the alliance with the pur@@ ge of the service of the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operational skills be &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US @-@ immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he sees to lower the leg@@ ory immigrants to 50,000 a year , str@@ ingent regulations for the maintenance of vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by way of changing the way of citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come to the candidate who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and knowledge that our economy will benefit , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
Ministry plans to re@@ sign route for race vehicle shuttle
over the past few months has been fought over the future of the racing shuttle bus - now it &apos;s supposed to be quick .
before the end of the year there is to be a round trip , which drives the Tourist Rail@@ road .
to secure the future of the road transportation to the long @-@ term , according to the local ministry of the public sector , construction work is scheduled to start in this year .
&quot; with the decision to continue to order and san@@ itation the circuit of Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ es , the country is also important for the tourism important link , &quot; declared the state Secretary of State Klaus S@@ ühl on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for the maintenance of the distance decreased to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country took 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered to be ordered in the future , will be ultimately voted , declared S@@ ühl .
the ministry and the South African train as operators are already involved in the technical details .
&quot; therefore , the road@@ map , that used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ ühl .
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
that the race @-@ Shuttle will take regular stays on December 2017 .
the race track shuttle is an especially popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ es .
during the past few months , in the course of a pilot operating system , the distance of sufficient many people had been used to support them again in the future .
the route is also highly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t be cra@@ cked in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robot happens .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) released a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus Professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascent seriously .
customers can choose the robot color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of finger@@ nails .
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key to the publication of his new report .
modern legends have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone @-@ ret@@ ina that feels warm , with deliberately human reactions that will be achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can adjust its robots according to their beliefs , &quot; and select it all , from the robot color of the robot to the form of ni@@ p@@ ples , up to the type or color of his finger@@ nails .
but it &apos;s more worried as many robots possess the &quot; personalities , &quot; which would look like a progressive woman of progressive .
modern legends have evolved into robots with a si@@ licate .
the Real@@ ix robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties , which they find it attractive , for example , rel@@ ying rel@@ ying .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of rel@@ ati@@ dness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality who is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; keeps the website of true companion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you like , etc .
in the course of the day , it also has its m@@ oods - quite as real people !
it can be tired , fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood ! &quot;
there are many wor@@ r@@ ying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ p@@ tive female properties , the respon@@ ds to rape , if one goes on a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah is on wor@@ ris@@ ome one of the most .
on his website , true companion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it &apos;s on the site .
however , these sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or simply just another sex@@ ist .
their emergence and its increasing refin@@ ement boast a little dar@@ ker and deeper conditions in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of Gender equality in a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as optional en@@ core .
most men , of course , will have no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R notes their rising popularity , they still remain temporary in the edge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ ak@@ ened out of the boundary zones may be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or offensive , until the free market gives permission to them .
however , there is certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robot in a time emerge in which the rights of women are threatened by women worldwide , in which the White House gives a pre@@ sidents who has prec@@ eded to have women sexually attacked .
the most det@@ est aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the ma@@ id@@ servant &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the swallowed up body and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision seems .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots there is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their inheritance would like to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , on the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities &quot; , robots represent no real women .
you can &apos;t separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no placement or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total sub@@ jec@@ tivity .
unlike expressed : they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : maid service
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human rights
it has become a binary of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political divisions , which have pol@@ ari@@ zes the U.S. voters , have also divided families in small format .
around Christmas and harvest than@@ ksgiving , the United States played newspapers with suggestions about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump &apos;s election .
we all supposed to have all of us to burst our filtration n@@ oses .
less not@@ icing is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , to bring together families .
I will mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ directed poet that lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , who visited me this week in New York .
she remin@@ ded me of that the unity of a common enemy may have a mighty effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republican Movement , with which she had fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks associated with itself .
the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the exhau@@ st@@ ive effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the possibility of having no more ab@@ duc@@ ed his cookies from one day .
however , there is still a frigh@@ tened long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards suddenly as ep@@ it@@ ome of dec@@ eit@@ fulness .
I find me nowadays from a active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the back@@ drop - the dog on the car &apos;s roof , which looked 14 % of income tax ( but at least we knew how its tax returns ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact occur to a very mild crime .
when Tr@@ ump goes down , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an un@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin in the town was , we brought our children to the car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ tw@@ ay of the New York park department , and the top three dollars you can spend in the city when you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enorm@@ ously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ ur@@ rig , and the animals are rotating in order to look at full fear of her own shoulders - extremely dark and the lim@@ iting music is a strange way .
so many mar@@ c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not just to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the subjects @-@ pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience since here two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old boy and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
when I was able to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked about it afterwards .
on the other hand , I was comp@@ elled to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance your rating with a 15 % tip - this is to purchase a little over the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but pract@@ ising pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store resi@@ du@@ ed , while I got tired of the experience , to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us re@@ located with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for the second time in jail for a hospital .
last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of pur@@ ses to his wrist@@ s , which he had suffered from prison according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence because of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ el@@ amp in the early morning of the paper by taking them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girl@@ friend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal penetration , who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal to the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say it is too dense .
the National prosecution authority said that it will rise in the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objec@@ tion could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .

when Bauer Arnold to find a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ t@@ ug@@ ly äss@@ ler and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holiday and the ongoing schools .
three of the students go to school in the school , four at the secondary school .
school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol for the training department , the 29 students of the four classes elected by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young Eagle , who grows up in the chicken yard , but then released for freedom .
for this purpose , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar performed a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken yard . &quot;
farmer Arnold was a strange egg , and made it hat@@ ched by his chicken .
instead of a chicken breast there was a small eagle .
but the hope to make a chicken shed , the e@@ agles spread its wings on a high mountain and escape .
after that , the classes also appeared three and four in the study of Y@@ v@@ onne Frank a chicken .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder bore to the bet .
the eagle stand for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young man would be different than the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonged to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
they wish every quad@@ r@@ ition@@ ist that he feels passi@@ on@@ ated in his new school .
it was followed by thanks to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Mu@@ eller , who will always jump back with Ped@@ agog@@ ues , and the parents of parents .
the kitchen time is over now , stated class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
they only leave their students after two years of lessons , because it was a really great time .
finally , she can rely on the t@@ ug@@ ly .
for the end , all students allowed a song of summer time and holiday time .
thereby broke great joy with the children .
for the new school year , eight first @-@ kl@@ äss@@ ler are already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested because of Il@@ legal Camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of 1 August , in Si@@ th@@ onia , a group of illegal detention centres was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of free camping and place everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , which is not intended for its purpose .

software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers within an overview .
BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are to improve the emissions of emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin is published by the ACE Auto Club Europe for ass@@ essments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no , the processed software updates are optional .
&quot; the mandatory updates have previously applied for the vehicles , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed of updates ?
manufacturers have announced an effective implementation in the next few months , but not yet called exact date .
Daimler has informed that everyone should be concerned .
if anyone is due to an inspection , this will be settled in its context .
how long should the modifications go down ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this is from the commitment of the manufacturer and from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers do not deal with the subject of environment so far . &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the re@@ armament itself could only last three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what are drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ group ?
the ACE must wait for you .
probably foreign manufacturers would pull out , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE det@@ ail@@ eth this .
but just in the regions where the dead people thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there is no value @-@ loss for older diesel .
the ACE advised to wait for a sale yet .
ll Cool J receives the Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ am@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving of President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first Rap@@ per one of the sought @-@ after awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution was announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the ge@@ aring .
prizes will be handed over to the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a welcome and join together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the Le@@ ar &apos;s progressive TV series , announced by progressive TV series , has already announced to be taken part in the Gala .
the New York Times , &quot; he said , &quot; The Presidency has decided to completely negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - even to escape the means - and this bur@@ dened me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed that she will use tr@@ ump in order to clari@@ fy its visibility .
according to the former President John F. Kennedy , Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
among the former pri@@ ze@@ winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom Han@@ ks and St@@ ing .
we make the city lively
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ x@@ et@@ aker , goes to R@@ ente this coming year .
the job is already written - but the application is rare .
for the last 31 years , W@@ acker City Coun@@ cill@@ ors has been .
and the work is still great fun , as he is communic@@ ated in a press conference .
it reports varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it surprises him that so far no application forms the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the next possible time .
so - respec@@ ting the regular cancellation period - yet enough time for a job .
since Has@@ lach has been responsible for the administrative community as a sub@@ ordin@@ ator authority , the applicant must demonstrate appropriate connections .
this function wants to keep the town forever .
if you do not fill this anymore , the citizens would have to go to Offen@@ burg to follow .
but the town is also important to him , says W@@ acker who tells of a good company climate as well as a good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office several major projects have accumulated , and the W@@ acker is looking back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the future , varied projects are also available on the agenda : the re@@ modelling of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the underground parking place are an@@ gled .
the kin@@ etic bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium restoration is still subject .
the latter is going to be@@ fall with around 1.5 million euros alone , &quot; when we &apos;re doing it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
work here is fun . &quot;
was stri@@ cken for a cit@@ y@@ master of great play space .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dening can be justified rather flexi@@ bly .
&quot; you can move much , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the creation of the green areas will often be comm@@ end@@ able by citizens and visitors .
since the old town stands as ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have what pur@@ ges , &quot; when new@@ builds are approved , the separ@@ ating city master .
the town of Stadt@@ bau@@ x@@ ion has high responsibility .
it is building company , &quot; at the end everything is going on my table . &quot;
for assistance and coordination , he can count on long @-@ term employees : Markus Neum@@ a@@ ier ( high @-@ construction ) has been around for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
also , his successor is long , W@@ acker wants to follow : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and remain with the place . &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the other design of the city .
those who want to bury Roland W@@ acker should , according to the town of Has@@ lach , should present a degree in architecture as a diplom@@ at or Bachelor in architecture , and have good knowledge of knowledge in the areas of construction and construction plann@@ ers .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ Office under@@ stand high and civil engineering , construction planning , or under@@ line affairs , administration of urban communities , urban farm with building yard and municipal gar@@ dening as well as a municipal law , including monument protection .
tos@@ sed bike on lines : ground circuit locked
according to police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail route in the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were badly damaged , however , to be considered to be a suitable freight train .
the investig@@ ators go from two male stoves and search for the night hours after them .
near the crime scene there were witnesses of a bright ro@@ ot@@ ers and a bike driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond the Laus@@ itz region , &quot; said Ö@@ BB narr@@ ator Christoph Pos@@ ch to A@@ PA .
the perpet@@ rators , or the perpet@@ rators , would have brought themselves into great danger and also endangered the traffic .
in addition to the damage caused by the L@@ ok and plant , and the delay , and the costs for rail transport , too , too much of the railway customers could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
it was said to be a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , &quot; said the spokes@@ man .
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway line could be guided without disabilities .
almost ten guests were pleased to enjoy Friday morning , two of which looked at the correspondence .
goods were not made , but they didn &apos;t have any delay .
according to the Ö@@ BB narr@@ ator , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 meters .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( Flamm@@ able per@@ oxide )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts the exact opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could relie@@ ve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom of 300,000 , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhoea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected will usually come to alle@@ vi@@ ate meat and dairy products in order to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins contribute to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the expl@@ orer , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immune cells are pat@@ ched in the intest@@ ine to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hide themselves in the food , do not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells , which are able to em@@ ulate inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells , promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium is incl@@ ined towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments , a kind of tolerance con@@ stri@@ ving immun@@ cells in mice was prescribed by a certain bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ators .
and the bacter@@ ium requires Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a link between a bacteria type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ al , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han who had mice in their food , the more they had had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an in@@ tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel disease , if the same system is ra@@ ving for people .
the post @-@ doctoral fellow Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell who found tolerance as they found out that a group of study mo@@ wers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separately accommod@@ ated , this had not had .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which usually live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced , and there were six bacter@@ ici@@ aries found in mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing in mice .
mice were fo@@ stered in an ster@@ il@@ ous environment so that they did not have a gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria grow on the immune system , the researchers added L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ating cells .
when the active component has been cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han met@@ abolic , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ating cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i found the cells in men as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote because these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United made a &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the Chelsea last 40 million Po@@ und signed from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Cup Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed even more impressive in the holders role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
M@@ atic was excluded from the capture @-@ Asia tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve the Premier League season before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic started Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI formed for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three other new mandatory , but he insi@@ sted that the club has made a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of his four prime ministers .
to get three of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dre@@ am@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilots flew over Seattle in Washington State , but drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers about the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the ra@@ ilers , the shape of a dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a lasting test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new proposal for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind is yet twi@@ sted : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still left SPD leader , Socialist and Democr@@ at Prime Minister always looked after elections with a certain concern to Berlin .
merely none of the stor@@ yt@@ ale from the party headquarters , merely no counter@@ wind from the covenant - so the most important option of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz takes the party , this fundament@@ ally changed .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House are watching the events in the SPD @-@ gover@@ ning capit@@ als .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , with head@@ winds , would not even be described in the approach .
there were deep strikes .
and one after the other .
the Federal CDU is looking for the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green is simply not reliable , &quot; said the CDU Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial office network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising leader of a Green Party suffered from the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) pl@@ ung@@ ed into a serious crisis .
five months before the Sunday dial , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition of CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green Party executive leader Michael Kell@@ ner ordered the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return to its mandate .
the crossing to the CDU means a clear dist@@ ortion of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and campaigns of the Green Party on the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; it must not be true , however , a SPD campaign to be sigh@@ ted when on Friday morning the new Job government had reached the party headquarters .
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is standing for the spring of the green majority of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU without its own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of an entire series of large and small crises in SPD country associations .
and nobody knows what next comes next .
the Mis@@ er started a clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more , more appe@@ als the comra@@ des of the time .
after the legislative elections of Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was then - and it became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel took the support for the SPD , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite cut down the party smoothly .
with difficulty , comra@@ des came back in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had been holding new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was of Hamburg .
and the next stroke also came with him .
Mayor O@@ laf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost its Nim@@ bus in that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town burned .
and because he had so wrong in crisis communication so pretty everything you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z fights for his political survival .
so now Stephan Weil .
because of the VW emission experts and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been critic@@ ized in criticism .
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tional values were added .
nevertheless , or maybe because , because in recent weeks , because in recent weeks , he always tried to put on the covenant of acc@@ ents .
the amb@@ ition of the former Mayor of Hannover , its power in Berlin , remained not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they made themselves a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , because of the internal comp@@ ul@@ tery , the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens is basically no fault .
and Schulz are not even afraid .
sometimes the comra@@ des make an effort to keep up their own ranks .
their anger direc@@ ts to the Gre@@ ens , and in particular on the isolated Par@@ liament@@ arians in T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and Democr@@ at democracy , such as Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets her own car@@ ri@@ cul@@ ating interests on the interests of all the others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of part@@ itions in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets not been elected for its person as a direct can@@ did@@ acy , but has been elected to parliament by the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party .
the logical consequence would be that they return to their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the vote of voters off four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Weil &apos;s prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony candidate to the Bundestag election to the R@@ ND .
&quot; now , the personal kar@@ it@@ eration of a future CDU MPs set out the election results , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said further .
he demanded to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there have been more or more ongoing additions to the CDU Lower Saxony .
con@@ veying capacity for Ort@@ sk@@ iers III
those who want to renov@@ ate his life in the years can now be obtained from the country .
in addition , Mayor of Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of ste@@ g city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review to the events so far .
since 1991 it has been given in sens@@ ations of rehabilitation areas .
back then , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Baden @-@ Württemberg country took over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation region II from 2005 to 2016 , the supply was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the internal development and not only build new building sites .
on April 4 , you will receive the information from the Government of Government in Karlsruhe , giving it a renovation area III .
the funding amount tot@@ als 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which 500 000 euros would be from the country , the rest of the municipality &apos;s sens@@ ations .
how is a renovation area then ?
one will continue to investigate if Sch@@ in@@ dler died , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
it plays an important role , whether in the planned field , concern itself to san@@ iti@@ fy .
if necessary , the area borders may then move again .
the Ste@@ g arrived on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellars presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; Social City , &quot; in which framework will be carried out in the framework of sanctions .
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alisation of internal towns , improving the residential and labour conditions and preser@@ vation and infrastructure of infrastructure .
the measures would be objective , that is , per plot , carried out .
the renovation area would then be established as a stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , the existing order intake would only be carried out in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation region involved .
as of November or December , as possible as possible of the pro@@ positi@@ onal label , it will be possible to begin with the renovation in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then declared that each commune had to carry out the said pre @-@ publication investigations .
it &apos;s about to evaluate the urban ab@@ normal@@ ities , and decide how to be san@@ iti@@ zed and in which gir@@ th .
it will also be registered for the property also a renovation mer@@ k in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and make himself a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ized , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of those involved .
that is why there will be questionna@@ ires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and plot @-@ piece &quot; which , among other things , concerns the structural condition and sanitary int@@ entions .
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , data can be made up to size , spl@@ itting and residents of a living room .
the blue &quot; business arch &quot; is only to fill in the premises of business premises .
however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .
new structural measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler was still stressed that the distribution of funding was functioning after the &quot; Wind@@ dog principle &quot; - who first comes first .
no con@@ veying capacity can be done for later &quot; reserve . &quot;
finally , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ iers II &quot; were shown to make the attendance of a refurb@@ ishment &quot; tasty . &quot;
British inventor itself uses a micro@@ chip to come with a hand@@ ful movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door door , enter his office and can even start his car .
Steven North@@ a , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .

the promotional fees of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine La@@ wn to the South La@@ wn for an event which highlights the American manufacturing of the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers to the information of the military , which were up to the TIM@@ E Magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Nav@@ al One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states .
the helicopter designed in Connecticut was issued by a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ fighter from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck .
the White House &apos;s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter arrives on the South La@@ wn , following the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning to the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock and so long remained until the La@@ wn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if your departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
the original air @-@ crew remained during the event during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .
the notes provided by the TIM@@ E were not clear , if ultimately , a second flight crew was necessary .
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its federal funds , government property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question we asked whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts , and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; it sounds as if you are locked up , &quot; he rep@@ lied the Deputy Commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was declared by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave a violation of reform of health reform , which was in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to con@@ strain the government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as the Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically adv@@ anta@@ geous purposes .
pre@@ sidents are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
but its use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation into an investigation when the presidential airplane was powered by the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of its presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is thr@@ illed with the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the vice @-@ president of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to cancel the US President in the White House with precise centi@@ meters .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led to the White House 58 exercise sessions .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event numbered for the month &apos;s training needs for the month , said an official .
Hel@@ icop@@ ter units flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support committees . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were not the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps which were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man by S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said the company had not been involved to stop the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budgets for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ zation of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement set for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
record of the unit shows the flight time of the plane than 30 minutes from the Navy , Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; it is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; the costs for the tax@@ pay@@ ers are based on the basis of pro@@ curement rules .
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual resources . &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , re@@ funds for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week of things that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent .
and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which many Americans have ti@@ rel@@ essly worked .
it is , of course , reasonable to emphas@@ ize it . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acted with the helicopter , when he entered the event via the South La@@ wn to the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ fighter .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about its own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tri@@ cky business
top @-@ ranking of the Second Tennis Bundesliga occurs in the table third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will arrive tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table of the third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
despite five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has received the sense of reality .
team chief Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation .
on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ V power station S@@ V ensure imports from the high north .
&quot; their Danish and Finn@@ s can even reject operations in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay overlooking Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ar@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it is as always hard for us .
there you also need good luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip in the high North is practical .
his debut for Blue @-@ White could Maxim@@ e Jan@@ ine .
in the moment the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament , in Italian Bi@@ ella , makes it a French@@ man not to the Bundesliga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament will be playing for his first deployment in this season .
the so far un@@ defeated Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the white @-@ Russian An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski still at ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ b@@ üh@@ el on the ball .
he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ school , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories on Sunday last Sunday , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also return to the team .
enough for the 18 year old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World Ranking List in January 2016 , does not fill up someone from the sport@@ sman around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der .
how America can damage the O@@ MV
really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump worked not when he signed his signature under the law on the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected , and even Brussels compens@@ ated for the US proposal .
after all , the design is to pun@@ ish European companies , helping the Russians , to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
accordingly , investors in the O@@ MV district , co @-@ financed jointly with other European companies , co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Se@@ el@@ line Nord Stream 2 .
the thr@@ h@@ ul@@ ses is great .
yet , too early for an estimate of the consequences , the official statement of the oil company .
indeed , Donald Tr@@ ump would have had to raise even the sanctions per Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available to choose .
&quot; the press &quot; has viewed itself , what the Group could hin@@ der and what could really do to him .

role back@@ wards : the city produces 46 kitchenware
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch again .
with solid contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban pedi@@ gre@@ ens , the clock is turned back .
as of September 1 , the City of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the urban children of day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of the youth welfare office , this is a good news : &quot; we are all pleased . &quot;
the house is cooked except house : a cat@@ erer takes up this task and provides fresh boiled co@@ ols .
the city operates in the county area of 46 days of day@@ care centers , in 44 the children get a hot meal .
in the past Kit@@ a@@ year 2,@@ 800 children seated at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for by 45 week@@ days , in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; explains the Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if it stays until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 sub @-@ time staff from 1 September kitchen service : you warm the angel@@ ic food supplement they add to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give food from , clean , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned firmly to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two group @-@ groups , as well as sevent@@ een @-@ tro@@ op facilities - decides about the tim@@ etable .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz satisfied .
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier for kit@@ al@@ ic to implement more educational concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy eating and cooking classes .
&quot; the children shall help to prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen to the team is because sense .
even for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - so far as the kitchen forces - has also been done with special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm of the kitchen production , which it has been in the cost @-@ comparison comparison between pec@@ uli@@ arities and foreign languages for the city as the most effective , it is from the press office .
and that , though 46 sub @-@ time workers are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; but these hours fall at some 750 people in the educational area not so much in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative , if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , re@@ ig@@ ning director of the United Nations &quot; mission , said that hundreds of women at the Council of the United States will en@@ code in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
elections can only be truly representative and cre@@ dible , if women are unable to participate in all parts of the choice process .
Afghan elections for the provincial Council and the Presi@@ dential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban released threats against an election process , which coinci@@ de with the transition of international battle ships to a consult@@ ative role .
this year , elections for the first time will be re @-@ handed down peace@@ fully from a democr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role in women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan Independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women registered in a total of more than 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB @-@ concerns about investment in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ia factory in Glasgow
a union would like to engage in managers of the Bis@@ c@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie about the long @-@ term commitment to production at Glasgow in their work .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company had recorded in the future of investing in the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work at work , which includes other products such as Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
in a letter to the branch manager of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s on what concerns the financing of the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be replaced . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity over the needs of the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workforce are concentrated on the local community and the large space of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage .
hence , under the perspective of work@@ places , wage and prosperity , and from the background of Bre@@ xit , increasing the cost of life and the chronic production process , the Eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently need a thri@@ ving production phase at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokesperson for Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to this , as we estimate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB of representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we operate as all the companies involved in an extremely competitive and safe business climate , all our business partners - and that applies to all our business divisions and locations - to remain competitive .
added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .
we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . if our operating processes will change at the location , employees and trade union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
is the PS@@ G Barcelona warned for three years before Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the site of La Liga is keen interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti Can@@ didates
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave Ne@@ ym@@ ar &apos;s persecution , after it dis@@ covers an offer of £ 189 million to un@@ load its free@@ wheel clause , but warned them before the world record three years ago ?
the sensational approach has taken the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than doubled the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season .
after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar is the most expensive player in the world and to the highest professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G provides wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way such as Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way out to the Catal@@ ans , although a source near Catal@@ ans anticip@@ ates that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but was the soccer world three years ago from the PS@@ G pre@@ sidents warned of this view ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a str@@ ingent warning for any club , who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they don &apos;t know if they touch one of our players , then we will contact opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players in their sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appears to have exceeded this line , where the Spanish Society has put interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G clearly proved that they would not allow it to travel to the International of Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by taking part in their price for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; cathedral @-@ atzen report dischar@@ ges Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Christmas @-@ Spar@@ rows report on the abuse of de@@ vot@@ ees became the brother @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regensburg @-@ Spar@@ rows continues for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ing , spokes@@ man for reform movement , &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year old brother of the emer@@ itus Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would be much to serve the Catholic Church &apos;s reputation , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret about their sub@@ missions , or at that time , wrong assessment of the processes would express .
by contrast , the Vatican fund &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in the report about violence at the dom@@ est@@ ay of &quot; two measures &quot; was measured .
in terms of gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one knows that it would have to be &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Hist@@ orian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics @-@ Committee .
&quot; the habits , the Catholic Church as well as source of all the plague , is already part of everyday life and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go on to the church and this is a little fres@@ her . &quot;
in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; blo@@ ws were a completely normal ped@@ ago@@ gic agent &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one of them . &quot;
they find it un@@ fair , today setting standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope John R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger on the memory band &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says E@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he considers the results of the final report .
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment attor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows were sexually viol@@ ated between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s . &quot; with high pl@@ ums &quot; victims of over@@ coming , 67 dom@@ est@@ rows are sexually viol@@ ated .
in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 until 1994 : &quot; in summary , it is obvious that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotional mot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment of the students could also fail .
by contrast , in contrast to numerous other claims , many victims will inv@@ alu@@ able and in many cases , despite violence even positive memories . &quot;
in the interview , E@@ emann says , why the final report on the sc@@ ure sc@@ andal at the Regensburg @-@ spar@@ rows Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is on his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence in the &quot; Est@@ abl@@ ishment of Justice , &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one raise , many students produce his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it appears as chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became the e@@ f@@ ight , if a domain saving was no top performance .
how do you use this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when you read the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears in it at all .
he has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
violence processes in the pre @-@ school also took place outside of its active sphere .
it is possible to throw at him if late , experienced , or first attempts to have taken seriously either .
the Dom@@ ination of Dom@@ et@@ ym@@ ers , on which he worked , was felt by virtually all those surveyed ( &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; Better World . &quot;
so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents an excellent witness , describes it as &quot; hot @-@ heart@@ ed , &quot; &quot; sin@@ ful , &quot; &quot; excellent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; intel@@ li@@ ous &quot; , as an extremely good @-@ talented teacher , who provided the guys regularly with cakes , cookies and cand@@ y seeds . &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ ained about his Perf@@ ect@@ ism and its high emotional ern@@ eness , which led also to W@@ ut@@ out .
that he did not only beat with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the floor , but also ear@@ ne@@ yed and exc@@ laimed guys to the hair or ears he himself had regre@@ t@@ ted , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his hon@@ oring , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , far from parents like in teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone from us , who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state gym@@ nasium .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and the non @-@ violence on the pre @-@ school , they are liber@@ ating .
one wonders whether it did not dare to do with his mind and role as brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , that many media have just thrown on him .
at the Bavarian Pope , many people who never understand it , are still alive and e@@ ager@@ ly .
but the truth is : the report dra@@ fted Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , in connection with the report , there was a lot about mis@@ use of the issue of abuse with the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also put any processing or compassion on sexual abuse ?
Michael E@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; I never looked at me , to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; said an aff@@ lu@@ ous representative for the others , &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot;
the real problem with the declaration of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not trust even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a chor@@ us leader , who certainly would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ inion @-@ Student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which it had had fore@@ seen ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have had the respective perpet@@ rators .
I hold it ... even for a truly absurd , presum@@ ed that itself ... Bu@@ bs must have opened et@@ r@@ ently or more uniform , than compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ants , confidenti@@ ality , etc .
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
this report comes to the very clear result : &quot; in the run @-@ affected students and / or their surrounding area , he could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
what concerns sexual abuse is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger so free from each other .
so it cannot be charged , either prevented , or brought him to the display .
hence , there is no reason to bring its good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it was unfortunately occurred in some cases .
in the media , there was a lot of &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; to read in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ j@@ ab .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of having taken a look at his report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and men@@ stru@@ ed to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly what a mis@@ use of the report .
there will be clean separately : between the school and school of the cathedral @-@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence as well as , we say , other pen@@ alties .
in addition , the report inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also out of four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral leader of the cathedral factory .
the entire horri@@ ble investig@@ ational ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys were righ@@ tly sp@@ elled and mal@@ nourished , were all involved in elementary school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sk@@ inn@@ ed conditions have to have dominion .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boy only to face when they were already on the cathedral sp@@ utter school .
in the same way , as most witnesses came , the theme of &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; is tab@@ u .
it was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise of paradise . &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ ino She@@ et school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline , but not a dist@@ ic force .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims will inv@@ alu@@ able the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even linked positive memories . &quot;
thus , at the most , the accus@@ ation is left out .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods of time , in which it was reported in the lecture at the Pre@@ school .
the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself , and from the predecess@@ ors at a school where he had not worked and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
closed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the conditions consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann says : no , since in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral sp@@ inn@@ ym@@ nasium who even re@@ produced the report .
in this point , it indicates that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of neg@@ atively neg@@ atively pres@@ sibility , he recommended more urgent income .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was long @-@ forbidden in Bavaria in Bavaria .
before , they took place in a legal grey zone , just like everyone knows of us .
there was also hard to estimate , where the victims were exagger@@ ated or dram@@ at@@ ised , and where really the permitted limit was exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say , he always looked away .
that is simply not right .
only in 1980 the test penalty was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Taxis said it was un@@ fair to address modern educational standards at the time of time .
how do you see that ?
Michael E@@ emann : we speak histori@@ ans about the &quot; Fall@@ ent@@ an@@ ism of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; meaning the danger to assess the past today &apos;s moral measures .
she was quite right there .
but that of course not for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of rebellious and violence against innocent children , which goes far beyond that time .
this is all horri@@ ble , and I &apos;m glad that it finally works .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protecting , for all this had nothing to do with it .
its funds for discipl@@ in@@ ating and punishment , i.e. ear@@ plugs and ears to draw near the hair and ears , were widely used in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was banned , he also stri@@ pped himself .
what is the picture of his rainy days , George R@@ atz@@ inger has been re@@ printed with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope . &quot;
did the topic test relate to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells of his perspective , as the cathedral spar@@ rows played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not wear it by no means , that he led a str@@ ingent regime there .
but also this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without being un@@ demanding discipline , it would probably have been possible to form a institution of World tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador in Europe and its musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and cand@@ y alone , one does not make up a big singer and before every success , right in the field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcome .
as for a person , you have experienced George R@@ atz@@ inger during our talks at their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition I have met George R@@ atz@@ inger very well and always experienced as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people , from which you could not imagine that he could only do a fly .
I get regularly updated , like many former Dom@@ estic reservations still today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him - he is almost blind - and he is almost blind and treat him as a member of their family .
those who have not forgiven him today that he once was strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority .
most dom@@ est@@ rows are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and communic@@ ated the world of music .
and that he always was a good , v@@ icious teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lov@@ able respec@@ tful person , to whom they still look at and to glori@@ fy it .
and please , once again clearly : everything you need to give to him are educational methods which were at the time of the agenda .
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin @-@ corn .
there is the evil intention that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him .
now the arrival area , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably know not to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows , finally to peace in peace .
