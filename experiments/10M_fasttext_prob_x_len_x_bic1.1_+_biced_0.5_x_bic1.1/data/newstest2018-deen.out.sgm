<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your glance into the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where youths should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Gruber chapel, where it is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardener farms the former reason of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Münch promotes exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if maps are not currently available.</seg>
<seg id="7">It knows anyone who had to introduce themselves, because the car-Navi took place a green meadow instead of a ring road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bayern atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria in the state government, are all other than currently - yet very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is then clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patch carpet, which one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great overview map, for cities and municipalities in detailed maps, so-called primary leaves, were mined.</seg>
<seg id="13">These emerged, according to the Bavarian Surveying rule between 1810 and 1864, and leap of the first surveying in Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French armies occupied Bavaria since the end of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bayerns - of course, of course, for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when the French troops returned with the peace of Lunéville in February 9, 1801, the present neighbours who created the idea of an area-wide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">KurfürstMax IV Joseph continued the project further, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Authority management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urzsblatt for Munich is written in 1856 and is how many others can be found on the Bavarian State Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The early morning / today is the most impressive example of the country's capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The town has expanded into all directions, and has grown.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is steelling, relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, in 1877, the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">The ouling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of the houses were concentrated in 1856 along the today's plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian farmers in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the West Park, one sees anything as an fields - at first sight: in the zooming appears a small-part card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered flurfs from the so-called "Urabsorption," from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are no farmers still present there today - but small gardeners of the complex "land in sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of the outraling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, since 1810 on the scene of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow, and not a concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of the district of the district of the district of the district Au-Haidhausen, not just read the street name "at Gasteig," or from the Anger "on the ventilation," but also in great letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfield street they once locked out people with guards.</seg>
<seg id="33">There, in 1858 / 59 the Munich-Irish district of Munich was created at the Auer ventilation. "</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden presided the facility - that psychiatrist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the purchase of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the staff to contact violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">Initially, 280 patients had been accommodated. he was later extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime this capacity also wasn't enough - the reason for construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in the hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-AMPER Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrist.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the area of the former auer institutions, young people meet in Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" built in its architectural operator against the cultivation of the Irrigth, which was destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was in 1856 as "main square," the commercial street called "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">A crucial change carried out the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies landed a lot of holes in the downtown area in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a Gruftist from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof during this day, where these days the pre-work and on April 5, 2017, the Spatenstich decided to take place for the second S-Bahn station.</seg>
<seg id="49">Compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole on Marienhof with an aerial photograph.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Legal Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union for promoting Farming has issued a warning for colored people who, due to the discriminatory policy and racist attack of the State to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board of the Federal State of Missouri, which will enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to attract special attention by the State, as a number of unquestionable, racial accidents in recent times will occur and here," is said in the opinion of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people harder to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to release the warnings, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of civil rights that happen to humans.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped due to their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited events such as racist verses of black student at the University of Missouri and death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also shows a recent report from the Office of the Missouri Office in which it is shown that black drivers are often observed in the state 75 percent more frequently than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are conscious of themselves and their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," says Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be ready to bring along with the money or their relatives, that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri posted 100 Hasselt in 2015, following the latest figures from the hate-crime report of the FBI, who steps the state in terms of number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The itinerary is also a response to a new Missouri Act which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) published their travel warning for Texas and Arizona since the United States of immigration authorities were committed to negotiate people because of migrant workers, which is to contribute to other racial abuse.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel buddies are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Incense project is elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The herbailfence mfence project is a success project and is continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU parliament members Peter White and Kordula Kovac were built on site a picture.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the archeological area of the swivel family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local area met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwenndemann still bestows insights into his farm in which he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and as many young animals and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">Black walnut milk "is the alternative solution for the milk of its cows, so swivel.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the agriturismo is only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also BLHV-chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence as "elemental."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't generate on derlands steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space care for a lot of work, much must be processed with the engine sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have shown here with the conditions and topography", "Schwenndemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the eleventh operation and cultivate these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not lead a biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of its december project and is happy with the Leader of the Leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the request of the land could still be pulled out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation," stressed the mayors.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often present in the criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the electric fence in 2013, over 25 plots of eleven nations were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open surface area is thus 40 hectares, which can not be forged to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of €71 million, half of the leader was funded by the leader of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers came to invest 12 610, who had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of fences," explained swivel.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a really good job without farmers and farm women."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White, the best food is produced here. "</seg>
<seg id="91">The governement directives (lpr) Baden-Württemberg will enable the state support of incense.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence is the presence of one of the lpr conveying system.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area must not be farmed (Hanging over 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the request.</seg>
<seg id="95">In 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure of the event is 35 hectares, the calculate costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes on the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is, if they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">Americans estimate this as well as any other - so the carcased downfall Saddam Hussein's place to the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic Aaxe in a heated war with Jim Acosta of CNN, which took the president's drastic limitation with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller doesn't handle the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat crustrels and Liberty-Imitators would have plagued him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he touched their meaning, and in particular the importance that you were attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base has been added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complains: "I don't want to go on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an icon of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, was added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively properly, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only one, in which a state not only invites any old immigrant, but the arms of the poor: "your pains, your poor, and your oppressed masses, that afterward desire to breathe freely, / the apostasy of your wealthy coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh apostasy" was better on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller is not committed to literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who made themselves to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show connections between French and American republicans, portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical picture.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has got a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of Exacants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection with the image is a brilliant feminine coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change this long way from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is not included, but rather an early Neoconite that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not supposed to shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh found here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great triumph of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elending, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It's in the true sense, to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome, which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that of course not the perspective, which would ever want to recognize Miller and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not glow the way, but hatred, who is the only source of power, is kindled.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish Members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two Scots have belonged to the UK team.</seg>
<seg id="130">The scope of performance of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will be a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes in Scotland is something special developed "and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will pass it until we'll find it," black.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athlete think that something has to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit while Eilidh Doyle was elected to team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captains-speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and genuine feeling that Eilidh blended totally of course were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-Silver medal winner, who will compete in its fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">The best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The Rir center stretches along this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will be participating at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another Scotsman which one would look for a great season, which included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first world championships, when the only other Scotsman was on Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Manner chapters that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots not only belong to the team but in some cases also at the medals and at the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about team chapters is to be that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my team-mates have voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," added them.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb up to Poships.</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a capitalist?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It's really important to use this home support and to benefit from it that we are in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out and compete there and simply will be such a great atmosphere because outside. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you don't want to heat the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspaper beat him because of all, from the inpolicy up to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He scents with the critique, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics into silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">As in the year 1783, Washington said: "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep for battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">It brings me to Maryland Larry Hogan who must work on it to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees are blocking the contributions of at least 450 persons and voiced their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained about this week at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor of the governor dismissed the claim as freevol, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na," and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"there is only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when a type like Hogan is.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in a stunning democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary head-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with its voters and made his hair-loose head following chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons appearing on the page of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is officially declared as officially and of employees who are paid with public tax-Dollars - unnecessarily, and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson on Amelia Chasse argued the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trouggle or chambers or hassalle people who swinging the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments respectfully, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hoga Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi's Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD, was not hassable, but she asked to hate them.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I said that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current messages," she wrote in the commentary volume "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people are on the same subject, then they are abused by some more than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the governor as "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or negatively deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous periods, if one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical conducts and bring to silence or demonstrators to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this happens very digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials that criticises this, that he has penned Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County promised the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Marin (R) received a visit from ACLU because of its use on Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">That should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington the time of affordable ptos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of papers were varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous correspondent did beat on his guidance.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote all the letters of newspapers that make Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions that criticised his position on the contract of Amity, trade, and shipping by the United Kingdom, will overwhelmed his ministry, according to the historical documents gathered by the George Washington Project online papers.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put her into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of Expression, Outlook and Discourses belong to the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means to accept this.</seg>

<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 cases of lung cancer cases were due on passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.</seg>
<seg id="235">In comparison, he drew a private study on this subject from 1994.</seg>

<seg id="239">Construction work in the Villinger street are in full swing and "are reasonably sized," says the director of the court Fred Heinze.</seg>
<seg id="240">In the area of the house, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as there is plenty of seamounts in the Underground, which is not indicated in the plans.</seg>
<seg id="241">The traffic, which has always been handicapped again, represents a large problem for the construction of the company Stumpp.</seg>
<seg id="242">"the ignorance of the motorists before red lights and lockers is enormous," says Heinze.</seg>
<seg id="243">The road is closed, and only the liner buses be eligible for passage.</seg>

<seg id="257">"nobody wants to walk around after 17 o'clock in the village," she says.</seg>
<seg id="258">It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua New Zealand, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 following an controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders should vote before the occupying forces.</seg>
<seg id="259">A existing movement, which touched the independence of Dutch rule, turned quickly against the government of Jakarta, where the control of the region maintains and foreign journalists or legal observers.</seg>

<seg id="269">Papua New Zealand's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst children of children and literacy rates in Asia have.</seg>
<seg id="270">But it is also Indonesia's goldland.</seg>
<seg id="271">The largest and most profitable Goldmine in the world, grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a high landing province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="272">In 2015 alone, Freeport has mined $3.1 billion in gold and copper.</seg>
<seg id="273">In addition, Papua New Guinea belonged to an estimated 78 billion US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="274">These riches, however, are a source of misery for Papua New Guinea that ensure that Indonesia is preserving the presence of Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="275">A survey conducted in the New York Times reported that Freeport local military unit and units paid almost $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 U.S. dollars to a single officer.</seg>

<seg id="290">But in Papua New Zealand changed little, and today the locals are cheated.</seg>
<seg id="291">"our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jokovi, with expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.</seg>
<seg id="292">In fact, Paniai suffered a deep spot after Jokovis's inauguration in October.</seg>
<seg id="293">On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas carols down on a camp fire in Enarotali, when two indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle by the darkness.</seg>
<seg id="294">The frightened children told them that they should turn their headlights.</seg>
<seg id="295">One of the soldiers took an impulse to their tone and came later with four soldiers, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.</seg>
<seg id="296">The soldiers who had drunk, were hunting, and beat the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="297">Then one of the soldiers burned into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="298">One child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so hard beaten that he fell into coma.</seg>
<seg id="299">A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escalated the next day.</seg>
<seg id="300">About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.</seg>

<seg id="302">Some demonstrators began towing stones on police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="303">When the mood has been heated, a command was sent over an internal radio: "if the masses have more than three times resistance, they shoot them dead," it is said in an official document of TIME that has not been declassified by local media.</seg>
<seg id="304">Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto-quarters of Enarotali, saw the drooping danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home.</seg>
<seg id="305">Nobody was listening to the mood.</seg>
<seg id="306">"when I turned around, I suddenly shot into my left hand," he said TIME at the porch of his colorful wooden house.</seg>
<seg id="307">Kayaking still doesn't know who fired, but says that the ball came from the ranks of this soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="308">"it was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="309">The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, his cousin, who was the witness of the shooting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"I ran to him and tested his body to be sure that he was," said Yohanes, who only carries a name, the TIME in dark atmosphere.</seg>

<seg id="314">"it is about life and death."</seg>
<seg id="315">According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others injured.</seg>
<seg id="316">The news about the killings arrived just on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="317">In three weeks, Jokovi kept a passionate speech in Jayapura for a passionate talk in which he uttered sympathy for the families of the victims and sware, the historical grievances in Papua New Guinea.</seg>

<seg id="319">In October 2016, he was said that he establishes a special mechanism for settling historic human rights violations.</seg>
<seg id="320">But the talking started almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="321">"most injuries occurred long ago."</seg>
<seg id="322">Some were in the 90 "s and early the 2000 years.</seg>
<seg id="323">The point is that we have obliged to tackle these violations, but there are processes that have to run through. "he said.</seg>
<seg id="324">Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke with TIME on June 5th in Jakarta and said he did not have plans to establish a complaint in Papua New Guinea.</seg>
<seg id="325">Instead, everything is legally regulated, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="326">Wiranto, whom the UN has indicted for "crimes against humanity," said that 11 cases of human rights abuses in East Timor have requested that 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua New Guinea were already enclosed, including the Paniai-incident.</seg>
<seg id="327">Families of the Paniai victims were contrary to those allegations related to influenza.</seg>
<seg id="328">"I interviewed four times during the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.</seg>
<seg id="329">"I'm tired."</seg>
<seg id="330">He says he is still in fear of years later.</seg>
<seg id="331">"I'm afraid," he says.</seg>
<seg id="332">"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."</seg>
<seg id="333">His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.</seg>
<seg id="334">He says he was beaten up by the military, after he helped destroy four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="335">"after I had buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.</seg>
<seg id="336">The shoties have not stopped.</seg>
<seg id="337">On Tuesday, the Indonesian police attacked the villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.</seg>
<seg id="338">During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a Baufirma, who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, a person and 17 others were injured, including children.</seg>
<seg id="339">The man, the 24 year old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="340">Regular villagers protested in front of the company location.</seg>
<seg id="341">The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers, who acted on them by firing them warning shots.</seg>
<seg id="342">But locals say that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary forces) began shooting and killing one killing.</seg>

<seg id="344">"I have hidden two days in my house."</seg>
<seg id="345">The Deiyai Parliament called on to withdraw the involved officers and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police in the territory.</seg>
<seg id="346">Paniai was always an unstove for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the family-affiliated Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highland of Papua New Guinea.</seg>
<seg id="348">Many of the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, claims to defend the rights of Papua New Zealand by sporadise attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="349">Some of the top OPM guides come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response to the recent years thousands of people were arrested and arbitrarily detained in custody, under the pretext of "safeguarding" national sovereignty. "</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Among the people in Papua New Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty provides the dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice, which is sold in Enarotali, is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially Nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields in the sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="358">You will retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota tasted only 10,000 indonesian rupees (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">Over time, economic inequality between the indigenous communities and the new migrants have grown, which since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nabire have arrived in larger numbers.</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs that exist in the region are usually to the better trained and prosperous migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">Papua New Guinea rarely deprived capital, or the necessary skills in order to competitive their own business.</seg>
<seg id="363">"young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there is no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chairman of the Paniai tribe.</seg>
<seg id="364">Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua New.</seg>
<seg id="365">In addition, restrictions on reporting international media are exiled.</seg>
<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year, French journalist Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua New institutions, although the rare permission was given to films.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to Phelin Kine, the Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokovis election campaign, the restrictions on reporting to raise transparency and development, are not realized.</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's inquiet eastern provinces of Papua New Guinea and a black list," he said in an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="369">The lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbors of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">In March, six pazil states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshallas and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to examine the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua New Guinea.</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically been supported by OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia is still a democratic system, and there is free media so it is difficult to exercise the evidence of human rights."</seg>
<seg id="373">The people on site would like more foreign governments to acknowledge this.</seg>
<seg id="374">When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the guidance of the human right-ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source that also participated in the meeting but anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="375">Indonesia lost another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua New Guinea that they probably won't vote for Jokowi.</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokovi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the Chairman of the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="377">He wants the fact that Jokovi knows that the Paniai-people, aside from that it lives under the constant threat of a religious military, is located in poor educational and health services.</seg>
<seg id="378">Gobai says that the Paniai-people, like other Papua New Guinea, consider their voice to Jokoi as an "guilt" that he must repay.</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they want only justice," he says.</seg>
<seg id="380">Despite threats and intimidation families, families of the Paniai trussars resulted in a final symbolic act of Despite: the bodies of a victim was buried on a ground opposite the police and the military station.</seg>
<seg id="381">They know that maybe righteousness will never be coming, but at least it does not forget the persons responsible for their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="382">"a member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus with his heads.</seg>

<seg id="384">Fire capturing the 'Torch' skyscraper from Dubai to second time</seg>
<seg id="385">A fire place on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai, and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from 337 meters high, 79-story building.</seg>
<seg id="386">It is the second fire that sweeps into the high-rise in just two years, which is called the torch-tower (torch tower).</seg>
<seg id="387">The building was evacuated, breaches were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.</seg>
<seg id="388">"we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the screams of the people.</seg>
<seg id="389">We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor facing down, "said a resident that was named George Angab, Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="390">Dubais's civilian authorities said that the units of fire abatement at 4.00 p.m. local time (00.00 GMT) the fire extinguished the fire and cooled down the building.</seg>
<seg id="391">The government said they work in providing accommodation for the sufferers.</seg>
<seg id="392">The incident may be used for safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.</seg>
<seg id="393">An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its burning in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from the disguise, the exterior cladding for decoration or isolation came.</seg>
<seg id="394">In Great Britain, the police, she said that the system of plates to isolation and disguise at the London Grenfell Tower in June might have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that died around 80 people.</seg>

<seg id="401">We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions, "said Haggerty.</seg>
<seg id="402">One will continue to work on improving the competitors.</seg>
<seg id="403">Not only for the vote, after the vote, the final on a neutral place was added to the vote.</seg>
<seg id="404">New starting in 2018 are just comparatively smaller details: the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will soon be the host-right next round in the next round.</seg>

<seg id="406">More than 1 out of 5 US passengers bring forbidden objects into the plane, find out a survey</seg>
<seg id="407">A survey of flight passengers showed that more than 20 percent consciously were aware of or unconsciously connected objects to the controls of US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 per cent, which entered the plane while they accidentally contributed knives or other items associated with blades.</seg>
<seg id="408">Less than 1 percent claimed they had been delayed, they had to be irrable with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey was conducted at more than 1,000 persons - who was carried out by a Jet-Charterry, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that the younger travellers did rather despise their rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of the respondents, the admitted that they have attempted to fly with something that was forbidden from the TSA, were 19.7 percent millennials, compared with less than 15 percent, which were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that were deliberately urged to TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent stated that they have carried by security control by security control while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they were deliberately brought drugs into the plane.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it was interrogated in all country to find out how many accidentally believed smuggling from the airport safety and how many it would have been deliberately done.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that people who are most likely to wear smuggling - swisely or unwittingly - by security, those who were most often flying.</seg>
<seg id="415">However, the company indicates that the TSA guidelines are some complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="416">People are often uncertain, which liquids are allowed to take them or how much of it.</seg>
<seg id="417">It's no surprise that the biggest amount of confiscated items prohibited by the TSA.</seg>
<seg id="418">For a time, people thought that TSA could view books as smuggware.</seg>

<seg id="420">Elon Musk doesn't matter: tens of thousands of Tesla batteries do not cancel.</seg>
<seg id="421">Electro-thousandsassa Elon Musk takes you with the huge number of pre-reservation for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has previously reported that a part of the customers has already withdrawn its unbinding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales and more, sales targets, Tesla chief Elon Musk underwent a second, less glanced number for the first time: the cancellations made during the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">Musk frequently asked with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car over the last few months, whose delivery is just starting.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now, Musk has dreamed: of the 518,000 pre-orders a total of 63.000 have been withdrawn again.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have always noted that it is a non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays homage to 1000 Euro (US $1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "Reservation deposit."</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 45,000 such unwind reservations, admitted Musk in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">That the cancellation of so far exceeds twelve percent of all orders to be solved, however, the Tesla boss does not believe.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge with the ambitious growth targets does not lie on demand, but on the production site.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">2018 - all models have to be taken together - 500,000, 2020 a million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who today ordered a "Model 3" at the earliest in the second half of 2018, if Tesla manages to drive its brand new, yet never in practice tested production lines without any maximum load.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But comes to greater delays, then the incompetence of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="438">For then, the company can't allow unsatisfied customers to perate in droves.</seg>
<seg id="439">EPA boss Pruitt retired due to the provisions of the Obama-Era's rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after he had been accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, had to delay its former decision to reduce the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smog causing airborne agents.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change as its agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities as opposed to previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the lawsuit against his previous post in a German Federal Court.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is about a deadline which expired on 1 October for States to hold the 2015 standards for ground-floor ozone ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he will not hesitate to spend a year in order to study his authority more time, to study the plan and to prevent "in local decisions, or to hinder economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Trump's prosecutor in Oklahoma, was a long time a reliable adversary for demanding environmental protection regulations.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly failed to block regulations, or to refuse to resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden change from Wednesday is the latest legal blow for the Pruitts regulatory runback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Appeals Court decided that the EPA-administrator its authority has exceeded that the implementation of a rule by Obama administration, the oil and gas companies committed to monitoring and reduce methane decks to delay.</seg>
<seg id="449">On Wednesday evening statement, Pruitt suggested that its turn-back turn on ozone standards simply implies the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States by the complex process of timely fulfilling the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"under earlier administrations, the EPA often cited the deadlines for carrying out and then was waiting to be prosecuted by activists and others, and in an agreement on the appointment for the implementation," said Pruitt, who gave the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church is invited to the old cemetery-area of Tumour on Sunday, July 16th, at 4.30 pm at a Serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether his idyllic location and beautiful views over the village is the historical St. Hilarius plant a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serenade can conjure themselves from this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">Rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and patrons of their particular concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique dörfine small od."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembürggian secret guide, "Count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with which it-based parish church to Magister Eberhard by Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the certificate according to the certificate, on the Tumlinger mountain, except the former parish church, a magnificent court, belonged to which the church or the patronatsright belonged, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people living there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the town of Tumour, the "Berg" of the third, the magnificent settlement of the village.</seg>

<seg id="476">The patronatsright was created from the early medieval town of egg.</seg>
<seg id="477">A lord, who built a church, held out and occupied with a priest, remained in the owner of this church, and he was able to inherit it.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thus, it was the right to use a priest or propose a new priest to the Bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger ones of the two zeros at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell was first heard in 1692, but had to be left later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows are stacked and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undense.</seg>
<seg id="484">In the year 1796 the French troops entered the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and churchyard elements, and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">In 1809 the remnants of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead of Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple was standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year of 1834, a storm divided the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was broken off.</seg>

<seg id="571">Moores Ford: activists conduct racist Lynchact as a call for justice again</seg>
<seg id="572">A 1948-year-old Ford Bath drove through a group of spectators in the countryside of Monroe, Georgia, and shrunk to the Ford Bridge of Moore.</seg>
<seg id="573">Before the car, the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block his path.</seg>
<seg id="574">The leader of the mobs - a man-aged couple in a coniferous suit - took a long move on its cigar and looked at the test by the windshield.</seg>
<seg id="575">Inside, the occupants were moved in fear.</seg>
<seg id="576">"we want this n ---- r Roger!" roaring the man.</seg>
<seg id="577">"get him out of the car!"</seg>
<seg id="578">Scared the silence, when a young black man was torn apart from the passenger seat.</seg>
<seg id="579">Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is only a reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="580">But when a loop around the neck of "Roger" is thrown, almost all of them caught in the audience very real sighs.</seg>
<seg id="581">Since 2005, citizens are coming back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night, in which two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey, were saluted by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.</seg>
<seg id="582">No one was indicted for murder.</seg>
<seg id="583">"it is really unpredictable that no one person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who also helps in the organization of reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="584">"it is a dirt of a story, but it is a burden to our souls."</seg>
<seg id="585">Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congress of the State of Georgia and a life of civil lawlers.</seg>
<seg id="586">For him it acts as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.</seg>
<seg id="587">"we want to prosecute the termination, we want the termination, we want reconciliation, but first we need to receive justice," he said.</seg>
<seg id="588">"we cannot get to healing and reconciliation, until we receive justice."</seg>
<seg id="589">One of the court reports a towel on the bodies of one of the victims of Moore-Ford-Lynn on July 27, 1946.</seg>
<seg id="590">According to FBI actors, who received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of the Lynchtrial.</seg>
<seg id="591">But none was ever charged.</seg>
<seg id="592">Although the suspects remain on the free foot for decades, Citizenship say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions were always known in the whole city: politics and sex.</seg>
<seg id="593">In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens to return to Georgia for the first time to quit their vote in the summer.</seg>
<seg id="594">About the same time as the election did according to the FBI of the black colour butcher Roger Malcom a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a struggle - supposedly because of a woman.</seg>
<seg id="595">Brooks said the rumour had been in the city that Hester has slept with Malcoms's wife Dorothy and that the baby, which she bore, had not descended from her husband.</seg>
<seg id="596">On 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid 600 dollars to liberate Malcom, the FBI.</seg>
<seg id="597">He was accompanied by Dorothy and her Cousins Mae Murray, and George Dorsey.</seg>
<seg id="598">But when she walked away from prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, Lynchmob ring the car around.</seg>

<seg id="601">Brooks make it even more magnificent.</seg>
<seg id="602">"it was an electoral law," he said.</seg>
<seg id="603">"you were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" if you register and if you vote, then you will happen here. "</seg>
<seg id="604">For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.</seg>
<seg id="605">Its representation is illustrative, comprehensible, and is justified in a kind of deep racism, of which many believe that he does not exist in America.</seg>
<seg id="606">It's difficult to look, and more difficult to look, but Greene said that this is the point.</seg>
<seg id="607">"we don't want to talk about the Lynchen, because we are confronted with the ugliness in us," she said.</seg>
<seg id="608">"but I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or want to hear what I've been doing."</seg>
<seg id="609">The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest Black - entered into a room and in wait where Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="610">Wade Marbaugh is a German co-director here.</seg>
<seg id="611">He played the role of the boss clanties for years, but he said, the role will never be simpler.</seg>
<seg id="612">"I feel dirty, because I'm not so" I said Marbaugh.</seg>
<seg id="613">"but I think it's very important to get this story to life, because we don't want to return to these times."</seg>
<seg id="614">On the other side of the room tried the actor Darren Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, their lines.</seg>
<seg id="615">The piece begins with Malcom, the Hester's cries and pushed him, angered that he slept with his wife Dorothy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"I said, n --- he was wasted away from my property!"</seg>
<seg id="617">Rascona invokes the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then each (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene laughs best.</seg>
<seg id="621">"what?!," Rascona asked.</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>
<seg id="623">Was I too hard?</seg>
<seg id="624">"no," Greene said, still somewhat restrained.</seg>
<seg id="625">"I simply do not believe that white people at that time 'n --- he said'.</seg>
<seg id="626">"but," witched one of the other black performer.</seg>
<seg id="627">"you only have to hit the hard 'R.'.</seg>
<seg id="628">And precisely because the energy in space is shifting, a feeling of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="629">Everyone is busy making this right, not just because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene begins once more.</seg>
<seg id="631">This time Rascona says the N word, he says it is sharp and with reprint.</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="633">This repetition ends violent and fast.</seg>
<seg id="634">There are screams, kisses and then silence.</seg>
<seg id="635">A woman, clothed with a mourned dress, stands on the corpses of the actor and leads Chee Holidays, trauma "Strange Fruit."</seg>
<seg id="636">Her voice breaks with every second word.</seg>
<seg id="637">About a hundred metres behind it a group of about four dozens of crowd and tears are caught out of the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="638">The audience is divided equally between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="639">A couple is from Ithaca, New York, traveled to see the performance, many come down the street.</seg>
<seg id="640">They have experienced almost eight hours of Georgias pressing humidity when Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the tomb of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">Until this point, the killings have remained anecdote but now when they found on the same country where the Lynch-Morde took place, the air feels flawed.</seg>
<seg id="642">When the final notes of the songs will sound, Greene invites the amount to come closer and to inspect the dead bodies.</seg>
<seg id="643">Kids hocks to their heads, register the fake blood and the silent body and whispering each other.</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," murmbles a little boy, as if he reminds himself.</seg>
<seg id="645">After a couple of minutes, Greene gives a lot - and suddenly it is over.</seg>
<seg id="646">The actors throw the Lynch arrow away and wipe her tears.</seg>
<seg id="647">Bradshaw embraced Marbaugh, the man in the suit, which the clanmember has played.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nick Rascona embraces two of his players and breaks down in their arms, the emotional burdens of the performance finally breaks with him.</seg>
<seg id="649">"it is okay," whispers one of the women.</seg>
<seg id="650">"we know that this is not in your heart.</seg>
<seg id="651">You have done this from a reason. "</seg>
<seg id="652">Later the audience sat together with the actors together.</seg>
<seg id="653">A white pair of Atlanta stimulated a white pair with a black pair, which they had just got to know.</seg>
<seg id="654">Denise Duplinski had to find words which has left the performance.</seg>
<seg id="655">"it's hard to hear these horrible words and deeds... of people who like to look like yourself and those that do, because they look like this," she said.</seg>
<seg id="656">"what I really do with me makes me believe that the lyre is still going on," added, "today it is called" Police shooting "today."</seg>
<seg id="657">In the same room, Tyrone Brooks's farm is at his table, eating and remembers the civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="658">He said he already started to plan the performance in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="659">"the reproduction is inspired in a certain way, because she describes the terror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.</seg>
<seg id="660">"it's like we can learn from it, then it can happen again.</seg>
<seg id="661">Whoever does not study his own history, who doesn't know his own story is condemned to repeat them. "</seg>
<seg id="662">"idterdämmering" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth</seg>

<seg id="664">The stage platform (designed by Aleksandar DENIC) displays a shabated street corner together with wall rest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plastics and Elaste" logo from DDR days or New York Stock Exchange.</seg>

<seg id="692">And then a study of civil engineering, let's say, successfully canceled.</seg>
<seg id="693">I recognized that it is the wrong one for me and I want to do something different with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what are you doing.</seg>
<seg id="695">Make a social year, there's a glimpse, you can see how it is on site, in the focal point maybe even, really is.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it like that?</seg>
<seg id="697">Quantity: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester.</seg>

<seg id="704">With me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was also partially in the Ogs, so in the afternoon care guide.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me, this was the right one thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out.</seg>
<seg id="708">Different than in civil engineering?</seg>
<seg id="709">A lot: well, here it's not about to calculate statistics.</seg>
<seg id="710">One always has other people in front, each of which have a completely different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, whether a young person who has been picked up from the family - you must always go individually.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And they had no touch-calling?</seg>
<seg id="714">Quantity: I'm not the guy.</seg>
<seg id="715">It is a field that gives a lot.</seg>
<seg id="716">Much love, much kindness.</seg>

<seg id="748">In the end, the decision was clear: in two things he decides to decide on the establishment of a community living room in the future course of the future.</seg>
<seg id="749">Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase agreement for the still lack of land was signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.</seg>
<seg id="750">Although it still will last until the church's church is owned in the municipal property, there is now no planning experience for the project to establish a private investor.</seg>
<seg id="751">There is a discussion regarding a common area.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters and a bordering terrace with a total of 70 square meters space for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and majority of the Municipal Council swears down, such a common room, not as the meeting point for the residents of seniorical living spaces, but openly into the church.</seg>
<seg id="755">For example, the word from the "Strickcafé" made the turn.</seg>
<seg id="756">The decision to dispose by the provision of means of the ongoing budget has been pre-decided in the last autumn by sponsoring possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="757">The building is in the renovation area.</seg>

<seg id="760">Needless, just like Wilfried Sohmer, be that addition.</seg>
<seg id="761">When it helps: it has unanimously passed the panel.</seg>
<seg id="762">Not so easy it is at the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">Daniela Call to the many of their own buildings with which one is not so far from the window, because they are now standing in a common room from the window, says she says, "I do so hard to cope with it."</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger refers to the common room - but absolutely against a public participation.</seg>
<seg id="765">It looks behind a concealed subsidy at the property's property or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">This is not true, because with the acquisition of the area one is not given an allowance, but also get a real, in doubt as a marketable counter, is the counter's speech.</seg>
<seg id="767">Staigers request, subject to contractual decision, finds three advocates.</seg>

<seg id="862">The first season of the season was Andre Hoffmann, with the result that there were not the two opponents at the 2: 2 versus Braunschweig.</seg>
<seg id="863">"these were two counterparts too much, and we have to fit in Aue better," says the defendant of Fortuna Düsseldorf.</seg>
<seg id="864">In the ore mountains, the triple chain is to be optimized further.</seg>
<seg id="865">And a gate after a freeroll, the continuation of the road, too, will not fall into any more.</seg>
<seg id="866">For the future there will be so, no more besides Michael (Rensing) to the line. "</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his crew also comes to the experience in preparing with the three chain better than with the four-buys.</seg>
<seg id="868">"still, I don't know how to act in Aue," his trainer Friedhelm Funds, but Hoffmann is himself in his own cause, "because we are just being able to build the semiconductor chain in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," said Hoffmann.</seg>
<seg id="869">"the requirement is, however, that we are even better harmonious and we do not afford such a lot of abnormalities."</seg>
<seg id="870">But Hoffmann is also riding to Aue to win the game.</seg>
<seg id="871">"but if one can talk about an accidental start, don't know.</seg>
<seg id="872">The performance might well be okay, "he said Hoffmann.</seg>

<seg id="875">"the start into the season I was only after six to eight playing days," Friedhelm Funds who would not speak of an advantage over aue only because the game of Saxony was cancelled due to a tempest for the game of Saxony in Heidenheim.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season quasi with a home match," said Funds and Hoffmann might believe that the players from Aue might even be a little fresh, since they could have no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against the trouble-faves in the bones.</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know about 100% where they are standing," says the interdefence of Fortuna.</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of the Swedish asylum seekers published</seg>
<seg id="884">The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that over 80 percent of the tested people were older than 18 years. but not everyone believes on the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine (Brotsabalverket) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They should be more exact during the asylum application of the age after the Swedish migration agency (Migrationsverket), because of errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees, which were underaged.</seg>
<seg id="887">Until today, migrationsverket 6.880 has to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published its results from a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency determined that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are only performed in cases where the person's age is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are constantly growing during the last months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"we see no big difference in statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly consistent," he said the magazine The Local.</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases where the person has been evaluated as over 18 years, does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers has to be balanced about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there was 442 cases giving "propose that the examined person was 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examines the 581 results, it noted that in 243 of these cases the person thought that it would be 18 years old.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical examination assessments, for X-rays of white-teeth and MRI images of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised even in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptics is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus des Karolinska-Institute, whose work comprises the assessment of the biological maturity of people, to see if they were sooner or later than usually passed by puberty.</seg>
<seg id="898">"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the kind of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">Judging the biological age in this way is very uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="900">If we cannot say it safely, we should not do so as if we could it, "he said the newspaper Metro.</seg>
<seg id="901">Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of testing: "in general, you can say that the risk of reducing a child as an adult is poor.</seg>
<seg id="902">The biggest risk is when the person is below 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent. "</seg>

<seg id="906">"we are very good at the time, it runs great," says Reinhold Light, Construction Manager at the Road Construction and Transport in the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the work began simultaneously in all three basic needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building is planned for October and is secure to keep the timetable.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads through the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a vault wooden bridge built with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in the year 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come to the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">To ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges take over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are built of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach is now on Wednesday morning at the north side a 1.30 metre wide and seven tons, so called brückner flap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a Random version, which is also used as a road.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday the southern part of the bridge should be used a 2.20 meter wide bridge valve.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is supposed to pass.</seg>
<seg id="921">The particular thing is that it is involved in manufacturing components, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge coat.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip sensitivity has required the laying of lines through the construction work in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-label connected with many companies.</seg>
<seg id="925">Local residents were informed about the project in advance of work reports.</seg>

<seg id="1099">Nevertheless, my house has immediately stepped up and is located since the disclosure of Germany in the close exchange with the authorities of the countries.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules that aim to prevent infinite expenses from European football expiration, Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain shouldn't disturb.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, because the leading organization that monitors the European game has power to negotiate teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, which were launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG had to point out at some point that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without a major loss.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid $222 million (262 million $) to buy the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG may easily make money easy with safety, so Neymar writes and bring him into a galaxy to other stars, in view of the funding of the teams by the wealth of the rich ruler of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may need much money for the purchase of players, but must be used with legitimate revenue sources who enable them to break the break-Even point in their on the football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini, named UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that associations, who had received enormous debt in their quest for success, effectively fraudulent and risky to ruin when banks or owners went back their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP moved from concentration to the liabilities of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The modification meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003, invested a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the three-year FFP encamp period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And even though Platini is pleased by the presidency in Belgnade is his UEFA successor to Aleksander Ceferin continues to deter them from excessive expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly, FFP isn't dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso who is responsible for the UEFA Under FFP, opposite The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the net cash clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of his treaty.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five year contract, so that the readings for the next five years can be expelled at an annual financial statements of 44.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which later was lowered to €20 million - and it was ordered that the teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players, otherwise normal 25 players will be limited.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to outwit their financial statements by companies using the owners of a club, with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a cataric company could transpose the PSG, if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market tradition, UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">It was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsoring of PSA by Qatar Tourism Authority was blown up.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come upon payments of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have disputed that Neymar World Cup will be ambassadors to find out a great maneuver for UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to handle any attempt to deal with the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA has no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke in the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not able to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated sales of €542,4 million a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrive a blessing for Sponsoring Deals, merchandising and tricot kernels.</seg>

<seg id="1161">Swiss-spokesperson Meike Fuhlist confirmed on request of the news agency SDA a corresponding report of the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, Airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be tested every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>

<seg id="1169">As many applicants there are on the next call, Swiss will not be betrayed.</seg>
<seg id="1170">In question, however, only Swiss manufacturers are coming.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to pursue a renewal of the Treaty on the spring 2018.</seg>

<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's years, for the 90-year grunge era (as the pioneer David Wain and Michael Shoot the Sketch comedy, "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001 before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era, permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise, it feels like the time was getting short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" was surprising fairly well, not just because of its absurd mind (it contained a original story for a speaking canned vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By turning to the core of the gags - actor, middle-ages play gaps children who will grow up - nevertheless they create the impossibility of winning the last part of the widow.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults, who now play adults, is less emotional rooted and its parody is more after the watering principle, including a reef on the Stalker movies of the 90-s as "The Hand That Shecks the Cradle" ("The hand that cradle the cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">One point Stbert is a character featuring an Apple Powerbook, some Inline skating, and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>

<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still has not lost its virginity yet.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another go-vicious plot that was included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Shoot), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Like always, the courses in the best part of franchise are.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd to see the Matt Dnieper's submate of "singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">There are the Mombular Wahnsinns that could preheat this franchise like a kind of repetitive "seven-up!" series, until he reaches that which I will show as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band as they will visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now recalls a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even an "Glow" with its East against West Ringing Iconography.</seg>

<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is involved so much for the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda-drama - a murderer that carries a Reagan-mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, it moves away, and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," who has been taken up on a lower length, could always visit his Agitprop-Satire, since Gregor and Iosef always visits the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who lost a heap of hamburgers.</seg>

<seg id="1214">In addition, the officers provided greater marijuana and cocaine, firearms, as well as several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the same Razcia in Italy two people were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">More than 300 policemen were in use.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The mafia members convene, organised crime criminality, severe violence, attempted murder, and robbery of robbery.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor in Konstanz have been investigating on organised drug commerce in southern Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1229">The Federal Government Commissioner for Refugees, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has made a media report to large gaps in the Ausländercentalregister.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Shortcomings of the data registered there could be part of asylum procedures and deportation, "resulting in part serious failure," warned way in an analysis written by the Süddeutsche Zeitung. "</seg>
<seg id="1231">According to the registry, ten million people are reported by foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data are therefore administrated by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Because the data had not been well cared for, the data quality in parts has so far been not good so far.</seg>
<seg id="1234">In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who have long been alive, or citizens who have become German citizen and should not appear anymore in the register."</seg>
<seg id="1235">"erroneous data inserts can significantly slow down backmares," it continues to the report.</seg>
<seg id="1236">In statistics of emigrate people, EU citizens are covered, that would not have to travel beyond.</seg>
<seg id="1237">But such false orders, however, led to a distorted debate on the use of emigration, so that is, in the analysis.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Meanwhile, the federal government clearly began to return refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy when they visited there.</seg>
<seg id="1239">This emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), the "New Osnabraer Zeitung comments."</seg>

<seg id="1262">Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening the speculation over a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth "income" will remain as they hold interest rates into family in the middle of a intensifying print.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The S-Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed at 6 to 2 to hold interest rates on 0.25%, with less members a rise in this month because the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In their quarterly annual inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and in 2018, that the pressure on budgeting income would continue, however, inflation in the autumn is likely to rise to just under 3%.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it indicates that over the next few years, interest rate would be necessary to curb the inflation of Brexit and it said that the cost of lending would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mammut-Business package that was published before a year after Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">It will challenge you for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources from the coming of February, although it is expected that they are expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billions of Pounds.</seg>
<seg id="1270">After the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "in the central prediction of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) stays weak in the short period since the pressure on the reality consumption of households will continue to consumption consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">The interest rates repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be required to increase inflation and a "slightly larger" dimension than the markets.</seg>
<seg id="1272">Markets are projected to increase the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another year 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">The Bank however stressed that enhancements "gradually limits" gradually. "</seg>

<seg id="1275">It has maintained its growth forecast for 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The Pounds fell by this news from the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The Pounds fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision to no change occurs after the latest disappointing growth rate has increased the rising expectations of interest rates and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1279">Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is slightly recovering after the Bank at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1280">The latest annual rate of inflation offered little enthusiasm for households, which are affected by increasing inflation and minimal paypal, since it is going to become worse before they will repair themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1282">The economy is also reinforced by increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pounds, resulting in a part of the lower consumer expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes after a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote, which caused the sinking of blood.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy completely.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Prior to the final decision of the Bank on interest rates, the call increased after an interest rate increased by inflation in hard-pressed households, with three policy decision makers in July required an increase to 0.5% in July.</seg>
<seg id="1286">Inflation was reduced to 2.6% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said that this was expected to redress it again in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said the exceeding in relation to its target of 2% is "quite" to be attributed to weak pounds.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Andrew Monti, director at Coreco Mortar Brokers, said: "in view of the recent response of the swap rates, the mortgage market should be more competitive, since the lenders are looking forward to businesses looking forward in a positive way.</seg>

<seg id="1295">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first ones who will enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018.</seg>

<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in infection risk.</seg>
<seg id="1298">PreEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication are present in the body of a person to prevent a HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">To those who come to the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and persons with HIV positive partners that were not successful.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, appropriate participants are identified to agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known due to antiretroviral therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and registered with a doctor may also opt-in for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will receive £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for delivery of the medication in this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the entire potential of PrEP by investigating clinical vouchers, as it is used in large scale, targeted and implemented.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should expand the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent from HIV.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Life-life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court Apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold it.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne said.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something similar to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">In me, this apartment was shown in Earls Court and had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a single bedroom property with a covered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to go into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Staudroom and a mezzanine for optimal use of the spacious ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted to have high ceilings, large windows, a lot of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end, they commissioned the architects and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine which you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the submission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel structure is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so arranged to overlap one another, without having to bail ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="1333">Not only was to build a simple platform, but to make the steel so that it had the right height above or down the right height. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with plenty of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine is a classic copper light from Retrouvius through the glamorous lounge area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lights set the style to the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of skewers plays a role in adding theatres, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor can be mirrored to take him longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance there are mirrored sections for all the squares and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can unite the kitchen, if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Hinged kitchens are not new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a little bit of engineering went in," says Erfan of the stahlstrengthened, furniated MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it's so important that when you slide the door, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage room Joanne could win additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agents will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground-size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they managed to enlarge the ground surface and use high-quality materials, which provide space to its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional ties in a home," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love yourself in the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">They are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased size of a little standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could choose to leave this not.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps, new Chief of Staff, plans to limit the Media Abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others tried it and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly is actually doing it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">PAITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Trump, including reports of news media - in hope to hold the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by journalist Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met his first working day with conducting employees, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: bad information, which led into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in Stings - because the president would make better choices if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to count Trump by monitor his media device.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to television is back for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if a candidate stumbled because of an unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs," said the ex-election advisor to Sam Nunberg in February compared to POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit, according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a constant praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever "was under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaign officials do something that we don't know others - that Trumps tweets should not contain more ignition material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never experience something about the tweets that Trump is not broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff had made it a number of times, anger from it, then their effort was worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevent it, that Trump has provoked controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people have joined in a White House that are competing in competing parties, always trying to present their own agenda by promoting Trump material that may enhance their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of counselors, presidents of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump is able to react like a volcano on negative press releases, especially those with damaged Lecks, and that he can find out how these originate from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">It was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone responded to the President malicious, a copy of an article by Gotap.com, the website of the Internet provocalist Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a bunch of his Lecks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned from spikes on Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he expressed false demonstrations in the past, and replied it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began asking questions about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that then, then, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper dump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make the Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1433">An anonymous inhabitant said: "they went on Monday night after they were sent away from Bentley Heath, where they have thrown stones for the passers.</seg>
<seg id="1434">The Council must be forced into action by switching to the problem, as it was useless when dealing with the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1437">She added: "the Council of Birmingham knows how to make a job by keeping long intermittances in order to protect their parks.</seg>
<seg id="1438">I live without on the Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to pay even my togetherance if the Council can't even stop it. "</seg>
<seg id="1439">A resident who did not want to be called, said: "it is ridiculous, we just have seen the last round of this traveler, just to be looted by another round.</seg>
<seg id="1440">The figures have increased this time and they even saw a horse in the park area. "</seg>
<seg id="1441">A female speaker in the Council of Solihull said: "we are aware of an unauthorised camp on the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and collaborating with the police of Solihulls. we seize the necessary legal steps so as fast as possible.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In order to support our wake-up collection, it is very important that as many residents, a anti-social or criminal behavior in the police report, they call 101.</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof is Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is taken from the former hotel of Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1 next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">They are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the hotel Birkenhof with the then-ambience operation company mbH took place on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays lost each year and also revenues by the local fee.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In autumn 2014, in view of the rising numbers of refugees that came into the County, the property building was offered as a collection accommodation, provided for controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The town prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by the establishment of a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed in the community back then.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all, Freudenstadts Mayor of Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhgers with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, with headquarters in Bad Bergzabers, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The Group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabers and one in Bad Herrenchib.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You are called Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the earlier Hotel Birkenhof there have been a long time building container in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovations are made.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were torn out, blankets for partly dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be redone in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Rooms are equipped with large-walk showers, the entrance area will be redesigned, there will be new windows installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">Everything should become "beautiful bourgeois," how Thomas Scherer puts out.</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a jewel."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">It does not place at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a higher inner city level, emphasizes Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen are supposed to feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism director Michael Krause have he already led so Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The performances of the city are identical to those of the Hotel Group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">After the amount of investments was asked, Thomas Scherer wants to set up exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">He reckons just under a million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The exterior installations are also being placed on frontman, which is already visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard a large terrace, which is open to the public, is open to the public.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Evening The Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In Russia's affair concerning US President Donald Trump, special issuer Robert Mueller is supposed to have used a so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The panel recorded the work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" with appeal to persons.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper evaluates the step as signs that Mueller has expanded its investigation and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that the Committee of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps ältesty Son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services accused the Kremlin to have targeted targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were referral between Trumps election campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">There are several men in the focus of the investigations into the campaign as a consultant of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps, private and business environment among the magnifying glass.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post, "wrote several weeks ago that the Sondererator Trump personally wrote to the center and investigate whether the president in the context of the affair may have impeded the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Masters is to consider and decide whether the charge is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Leyys are therefore also called the count of counts.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Usually, they are switched on if there are bigger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure will always be closed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Furthermore, the Board can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to precharge persons under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the broadcaster CNN, pre-charges have been issued to turn the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement that was called in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. there were also Trumps advisor and law-in-law Jared Kushner and his damseless election boss Paul Manafort with the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right-wing experts said on Thursday night in the US television that the enforcement show that Mueller should not be intimidated in his work and that he should be necessary quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end, to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the enforcement of the Gremium was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia in order to depict Russia's affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," Trump said.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The topic give the Democrats a possibility to "feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about them."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His custom consultant Ty Cobb declared in a opinion that he did not know about the establishment of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But they usually work in the secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House forwards any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent to "faire" ways.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that not opposed to the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">One has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had been fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this scoufs, Vorum had become according to Trump, and he wanted to impede the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump took him for a setting up investigations against the then national security adviser to Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under large pressure because of the study.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to the representation of US media, the White House collected material against the Special-mediator and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">That triggered speculation about whether Trump mueller wool wants.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special issuer conference like Richard Nixon's Watergate affair, Mueller sent a position in which he could be fired in theoretically at the insistence of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators, on Thursday, bills are proposed, after which the special issuers could not be put out so easy.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic ice mountain drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Arctic, a gigantic iron mountain has loosened from the casket of the Schelfestivity.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This divided the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The more than one trillion tonne of heavy and 5800 square kilometres large coloss drive now to the north and will probably have two, three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest kingdoms of the researchers have registered in the last three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A risk for people is not from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent the climate change has played a role in the demolition of the ice rink, after research is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there has been a series of unusual mergging of iron in the region for around 30 years, the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) writes in an invoicing background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, it could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken-down Koloss was now a part of the Larsen-C-Schelbow.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfestivities swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelbow is located south of South America nearly on the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe the equilibrium of waxes and abort was disturbed some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete chubelous is to be broken there, writes AWI-Researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are some evidence that the Larsen-C-Schelbow is in danger also, because the front edge of the Cannon was never so far withdrawn, as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice-slab stand under stress and can be disintegrated if there is a piece of keys.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of cockrocools and Eisberg increases the sea level not as they swim on water and ice as much water as it would melt after the melt itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the shingcircle causes the glacier to go into the sea directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only in small dimensions, the British research project on observation of the Antarctic (Midas) writes.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfestivity is the fourth biggest of the Antarctic in accordance with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge of the free ocean some 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There breaks it regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural, and we have no direct link to climate change, the ice sign is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most extensive retreat since the start of records," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists should be controversial, whether the Larsen-C-Schelcools come back again and possibly fall apart, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researcher did not lead the demolition of this gigantic ice hill to climate change, so in recent decades, many kingfice of the Antarctic Peninsula have broken.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt on Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The reduction in temperature increases.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been heated by around three degrees during the past 50 years and taming the areas in which the temperature is fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to join the FDP together with the FDP and UWG, and join the department of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">The administration should be "a concept for the personnel promotion, personnel development," according to the request of the parties. "</seg>
<seg id="1562">The goal is to cover not only short-term admiration of professionals, but forward to the future oriented of the candidate shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented according to the internal and externally oriented actions aimed at cross-level measures and include a check-in action, demand for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds already a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems, which one never knew so.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees, offering more attractive terms.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is marked by a real "competition of public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">This comes to a high number of employees, sickness, or age-conditionally from the service.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So the highest time to act, so that no longer vacancies remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter's people, the leader of the CDU, joined the party with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He looked unlong already in the crackday for a fat-rather surprise when he questioned the staff coals publicly and the remaining parties contracted.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be checked, enabling a exit from the municipal employers association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we don't arrive at short notice to a satisfactory solution, the county administration should be in cooperation with the trade unions - maybe even in cooperation with the county-affiliated cities," So peoples.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This means the CDU, employees, and officials to pay better when it is actually looking for the public service for public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently mandatory, increases or more money there is only if you move into a higher level, which are oriented toward professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitute's law.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid agency 'Youth Rings' because their crew had worked effective with traffickers in a way that the illegal immigration had been lightened.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The aid organisation, which has been operating only since a year, rejected it from executing the Italian state of Ambrogio cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of the human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we can not operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone," said the organization in an opinion on social media.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can judge all accusations, which currently can be judged, only after we collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rager', which was supervised by the Iuventa.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that his crew will take hose-boat migrants, which can be delivered directly from traffickers, and that the smugglers can continue, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one of these meetings took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected to prevail over the authority of the Italian coast guards, the rescue plan in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives are taken away.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have aboard a Italian police officer, who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been declared to date up to the code: save the Children, MOAS of Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter spoke on Thursday that the new rules would be unnecessarily but acceptable, since it would not be any "essential amendments or disability" of their rescue actions.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Minniti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy came back in the past few weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and the cooperation with the local masters of fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month over economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali, on measures to reduce number of migrants who left these countries in hope to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region to enjoy Trials and sights for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three kept Guides for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation at the Wachenheimer Feld turned out to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures across the vineyards on Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">They followed observation points, partly on towers, of which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer forest and the pre-camped planes.</seg>
<seg id="1604">There was always a longer rise, for the long trials.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the popular Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again lookout point to view point, connected by "flowerge" Trials and moderate approach.</seg>
<seg id="1607">During the last two days, many ups were announced again.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and cottages brought down breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim, the Bikers in the open-air conditioning system atmated.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>

<seg id="1614">Fact: e-Sport has long been to an increasing business, becoming a lucrative business - great stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high Gagen included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These are also the first federal government, which are increasingly recognized in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The VfL Wolfsburg, which started in 2015, followed the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1623">"real football must deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people still walk into the stadium," says the 52 year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And, the clubs, all possible markets, especially the Asian, were to conquer.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could only be present online more often on these markets than once in the year the federal government will send to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">Why is it exactly?</seg>
<seg id="1627">At the e-sport computer games such as "League of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike," or the football-simulation of the FIFA World Cup FIFA will be negotiated.</seg>
<seg id="1628">Long ago, as in normal sport, Lives established that the pros will compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asia Pacific, E-Sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the imagination is certainly accustomed.</seg>
<seg id="1632">In too, Ingo Froby has dealt with the issue for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports- University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because he is competent and showed many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classic sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">Furthermore, there are cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers shouldn't only exercise to the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fined player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But the bad thing also looks a problem: "doping is always a subject."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Checks are hard-managed at online games, and in the scene failed the structures of classic sports.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientists have a positive effect on the eminent effect of E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are on the way around the world, which is like a great global family, there are no intercultural intentions.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study of the corporate consultancy Deloitte, and the Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) says to the e-sport a rapid growth ahead.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, more than 50 million euros have been implemented, mainly advertisements, sponsoring and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, revenue is to be 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league, this is little.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the E-Sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultant.</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Michelle Carter for the lyrics, causing Conrad Roy to suicide</seg>
<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years, because she encouraged her boyfriend and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced in June for negligent homicide of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is not comforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter allowed to stay free to appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">She was confronted with a maximum of 20 years, but their legal representatives went on to argue that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured bluse, Carter stand there with tears in his eyes, folded and down-facing eyes when they were condemned.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the lawyer's lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1671">"she finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">She has no responsibility, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="1673">"it has no remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carters's lawyer said it was a "awful revolution which they are unfortunate."</seg>
<seg id="1675">Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find that their "age or ripeness or even their mental disease has a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">A public prosecutor, a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy, said that there is no one day when I did not catch the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="1677">I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything. I try, despite all my pains that we will carry with us forever, for his sisters there, "that is in it.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Roys Sister, Camdyn Roy, said that they have never been persecuted by the realization "that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aunt for his children.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a real precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts, that makes it a crime to challenge another, committing suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case attracted national attention, after Carters's text messages revealed that they had encouraged him to complete his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hanging up, spring from a building, steeping yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent them in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the sight of his suicide she wrote: "you must do it, Conrad," and "Everything that you must do is to turn the generator and you'll be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz told that Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">To the few who have defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murder on her British collaborator in Italy before she was acquitted on two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published in Los Angeles Times a comment: "Michelle Carter won compassion and help, not prison."</seg>
<seg id="1689">Joshua Kimmed: learn from the new Mini-Lame of FC Bayern</seg>
<seg id="1690">That Joshua Kimmi was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as captain, is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="1691">FC Bayern trusts the Confed-Cup winner for a big season - does not harm extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Anything was different at his place in the cabin, that was Joshua Kimmed immediately, even if the extra piece was very, very small.</seg>
<seg id="1693">But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, there was no Philipp lamm and no Manuel new to see, he joined the arm in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the coach did not have announced," the Confed-Cup winner was back after his first deployment as a Bavaria-captain.</seg>
<seg id="1695">Well, the one could have better run than at the 0: 2 versus the SSC Naples.</seg>
<seg id="1696">But the sign from the coach could also suggest that.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Not the eight year old Arturo Vidal was chosen out of youth chess players, debutants and just out of the holiday passed by the C-Elf as a player.</seg>
<seg id="1698">The sugar, one is most commonly found to those who want to hold a good mood in Laune.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Those who have been expelled to race the Lame of Lame, can only use a little extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimmi confirmed: "this is what you want as a player wants to take over responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="1701">On Wednesday the 22-year-old attracted a mini-lame on the field.</seg>
<seg id="1702">Right behind, that is now its position, the white Binde at the arm did their rest.</seg>
<seg id="1703">And at all, Kimmich worked as the one that can take the rest in the hand as well.</seg>
<seg id="1704">He gave instructions to direct the troupe troupe.</seg>
<seg id="1705">He had a view of the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Vidal therefore, his missing fitness to overplay (foldable hardly); Renato Sanches thus making up on the top of the services of the Asia Pacific (foldable also only conditionally), and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle did not stop negatively in their first performance in the Bavaria-Trikot.</seg>
<seg id="1707">All that worked very well.</seg>
<seg id="1708">Süle ran beside Kimmi, Rudy in front of the defense, both agulated.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The well-known Napoli storm did difficult, in addition, Süver tried to successfully tested a few times in the play-building.</seg>
<seg id="1710">His colleague Rudy had the fact that the result was "not the case, as we hoped for."</seg>
<seg id="1711">But he also showed a decent performance in the debut.</seg>
<seg id="1712">Reproduction, tempo changes: "I was also fetched for this style."</seg>
<seg id="1713">As usual, this Bavaria-world is still looking for new access to the game.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Rudy, for example, gave the catacombs not one or two, but determines six or seven interviews.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimmich passed after a few crispy statements on his new player's back.</seg>
<seg id="1716">There he heard of Süle an interesting sentence: "what's going on, I already noticed.</seg>
<seg id="1717">With Bavaria, you must just win each game. "</seg>
<seg id="1718">After all, he does not have to teach the new one more.</seg>

<seg id="1723">The establishment of the Austrian Football of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation.</seg>

<seg id="1725">With Rhineland-whistle Minister: Economics praises Gausings tempo</seg>
<seg id="1726">Often it was often unreconciled, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still an economic Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.</seg>
<seg id="1727">This shows itself after more than a year, in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V-request by a change in economic policy - and tadmires the old female government at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wisdom attacks the desires of the economy, the Lemke has all blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1730">Natus's largest reversal sees Natus in infrastructure politics: the linking of the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is in the priority list of the country now.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Even this year, the Ministry for planning a planning process is due to be the building law.</seg>
<seg id="1732">A role in the plans of the country also plays the west-speaking Trier, which is on the prior planning of the federal government plan.</seg>
<seg id="1733">The aim is to take the route in December 2020, says the Ministerial Meeting in Cornelia Holtmann.</seg>
<seg id="1734">Natus looks at a sign for regional but internationally competitor companies.</seg>
<seg id="1735">The Chamber of Commerce and Commerce (IHK) is striving as excited by the wine a Rhineland-Palatinate label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports since ten years.</seg>

<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">When planned roadworks may be quick facts to create, at the same time it fails to the necessary personnel, Jan Glockauer, the chief executive director of the IHK Trier.</seg>
<seg id="1741">From 56 new engineers, who want to adjust their mobility at national operation, only 29 positions have been occupied.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The IHK requires to give more orders to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="1743">CDU faction, Christian Baldauf also refers to the calculations of the Court, the country in 2017 and by 2018 more than 20 million euros in the preservation of state roads as suggested.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Frank Natus is also expecting a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition, the previous broadband building is in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1746">In 2016, regional companies had evaluated the power supply in an IHK survey only with the grade 3.4.</seg>
<seg id="1747">They complained about moldy Internet connections and quarries.</seg>
<seg id="1748">In contrast, former economic Minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi said BMW, that it would offer to update the software to more than 350.000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW-President said the fact that "there is more intelligent options as a driving limit," and thus the company moved to European cities, including Munich where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to provide or restricting diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a repayment.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the observance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides, which emit diesel engines, are regarded as carcinogenic and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers, plants for neutralisation of diesel vehicles to install out exhaust gases, also assume what it is difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignoring the powerful auto companies and ignoring the problem of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The company try to avoid mistakes of Volkswagen that could be used to regulate the use of so-called sequence of components to regulate the provisions if a car was tested, but at normal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">Several employees were charged in the United States, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be filed in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen, after the authorities have accused of having installed a system to bypass the emissions requirements in Europe, and a request that focused on the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be heavily loaded by Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes decisively to the gain of Volkswagen.</seg>

<seg id="1777">Mordillo was one of the most widely published cartoon animations, the creases of his figures are his trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Even with 85, the Argentinian man even works and works on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">His message: laughter, "for there is much suffering in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he was among others, as a drawing for lucky tickets - what frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, at the end of the 1960s, he succeeded in breakthrough: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again the artist was inspired by the artists.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures mugs in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The early morning, according to his own information, he also still sits on the drawing day, works almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">About Calendar, Puzzles, Books for Gross and Small, T-Shirts, Plush favorites and watches are still finding a lot of spread world wide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">For six years he also works on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousandddriver as counterplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D movie, which is to come to the movie screen in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="1792">"I don't know what they are saying, it is strange to me," says Mordillo.</seg>
<seg id="1793">The script will not be written by him.</seg>
<seg id="1794">This is why he is rather set on the TV series, which is produced as its original drawings, worressly produced.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Lavender Lavender from Provence by Climate Change</seg>
<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is decreasing because of the conditions that are borne due to drought conditions and, due to the impurent insects, which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, create great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert of the agricultural research firm CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to impacts of climate change in recent years, much more rain in spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that carries the dwarf-clades, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not only attracted to holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "rather than having a long plant tubes with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either weakened or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered into account are a better water distribution and the slowing down of the surface, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water, and the development of varieties, which are more resistant to dryness.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The Assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of Weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and unceable drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to take their children to the office, which were the target of a attack with grenades, or leave them at home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts wrote three words on a plaque at the forefront of the room: opponent, Neutrale, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to submit perceptions and abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug vendors, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand at the behest list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that will make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no rest periods of violence, and throughout the country the bodies are frequent: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 have been standing for attacks and threats from federal and up to now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is its editors and its inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is felt deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the Thirty Years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear t-shirts, who show his smile face with glasses or his typical Panamanian.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special prosecutor was set up in 2010 to process the instances of journalists, it was led to the Committee to protect journalists only by two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders that are linked to drug dealers and organised crime each year, the killers of journalists will only be tried by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce they still consist of treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inseparable, although the Terrain is now even more acidified.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting regarding the discussion of safety is little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we suspend everybody."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was forced on two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "12th River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The arching drove in his car and damaged it close.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But regarding Valdez, there is practically no silence on Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans's arrest in January and the extradition of the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, because rival factions struggles to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It makes no matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot dead on the street or that the cemetery is full of embellished, two-story mausoleums for drug users who are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget about a minute that there is a state of "calm," if only a cartel takes control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the blame that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February the publication of a interviews with Damo Lopez, a leader of the rival of competition in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have disscandalized the sons, transmission members bought each copy of the output as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake had not been to force Valdez, after the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same history to leave the country on its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues took that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined with five colleagues at the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 USD investments.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without puncturing the smoking problem," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and the turnover and advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to release hard trespicious examinations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by an publication that no one else could deal with stories.</seg>
<seg id="1849">She received eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors" Cabot Award "for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever they did.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily, that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life, "said he in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in October of October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task that fallout to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do about so many dead... why did you not say what went before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce-team is missing Valdez, the fun bird that was flux like a dockworker, the boyfriend who was generous with hugs and counselling, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, go there and sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine to be a routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death had also forced to ask her own impassumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive in the life.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret start- and landing ways," to make drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-shatts and self-maintaining.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincies.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells untrue, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the ozoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a meaning that can be deceived was... and then the matter is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where employees met by Riodoce to security training, suddenly no cell phones are allowed. days earlier, Spyware that was sold exclusively to governments, used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in joke, some of the Reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who described the governor himself as a trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporter had gone into the mountain landscape, where drug users are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has rocked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to state spending, focusing on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Office of Office, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about it, who was abducted or how it happened, so careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite locally by drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who listens to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (pri) which ruled nearly all the century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several pri governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal begged the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" did not escape a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months ago, the readers had the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in former times, we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body composition.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez Office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, which protest against the murders of journalists, because the staff had become something that they never would have expected - activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Replica Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration for another journalist for the Office of the Office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists became stronger in the country by having settled in organised protests "SOS Press" on obedience and construction.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day the director Bojorquez was gone in Washington and tried to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spatter journalists and release them because they have told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked that it is divided into the government by the government, because it is concerned that their anger has hurt its objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists gathered in Mexico by organised crime, involved in government officials and a valid society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his final book "Narco Journalism" he wrote that reporter can not only be killed by drugs, but also on orders of politicians and security forces, which were staked in organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="1896">The "Articulo 19" group has more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials last year.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want to hold the mouth," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forget the death of the Blogation Maria Elizabeth Macias at the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones were separated from their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern state of Chihuahua, following the assassination of the correspondents MIROSLAVA Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do how El Manana von Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug files with an Editorial on the front page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists escaped from their home country or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and search for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes it is chased, as evidenced by the photographer Reuben Espinosa, who was murdered in a home in Mexico with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who stay back and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, announces that drug dealers are troubled.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to Hell, and therefore I became reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition had already finished, the editors of Riodoce was sitting on the pavement in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones started to swapping.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shoties with ribbed belts and security forces near the sea of Mazatlan had left 19 dead bodies.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continues, as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the on-board ship, they published news on the web site by Riodoce via mobile.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens are near - a further shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers, who held guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid at all, they didn't show them.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Under the enormous portrait of the founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the people of Riodoce followed his traces.</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just remember," said Bojorquez, "if the same day when Javier has been murdered, the intern asked me to send them to the road."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to soften his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue, though a terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now, researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhinorns of a Canadian miners were so well preserved that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even determine that his created skin was reddish brown - and they said they'd have had something of a "inquiet past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described him as "the dead Dinosaurs, who has ever been found, and one of the best Dinosaurs specimens of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-preserved state has researchers to describe it as "truly remarkable"</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the inherited vegetable hereaters is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Radio, when he arrived at Suncor Millenium on March 21, 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, dug.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met on something that appeared from the surrounding rock at the Platze, and decided to look closer.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him in the Royal Tyrrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) of heavy soil.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished outcome is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinking a little with the eyes, you could almost believe it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrrell Museum, where the creature is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go to scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Dinosaurs specimens - Mona Lisa is the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this vegetable hereaters, although it is covered with a armour and resembles a walk-like tank, probably managed by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily mored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide in predators, and used a parachute technology that is also known as counterfattening, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to expose yourself into its surroundings and exploit his enemies, experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creation from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now able to see the Royal Tyrrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild beast and is called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technicians Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of specimen made it possible with Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of shed and armaments about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shady, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the convection is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta exceeds the animals today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs was hunted by a sufficient pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that the evolution of the deterioration of confrontation would be the means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the convection - think of Rehe, Zebras or nibans - are much smaller and injurious than loot, what signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real battle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behaviour on a massive, strong mored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators of the Cretaceous have to have been," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur bay was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on hints about his life, including his final Darminate to find out what it served as his final meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, came into a river and pushed into the sea, where it sank to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta were as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much more inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable, because it has been completely covered with constriped skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of animal life," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You do not need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you only feel a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous was a time when giant leopods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, passed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the King of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the mored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his horrible ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, their latest findings in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sank after the death in the sea and in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millenium, near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, dug.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely destroyed by the muzzle up to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch spikes that rapped from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the mored plant hereaters were swamped through the western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater ascent of the dinosaurs keep his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The remnants of this particular specimen are so good that the Hauste still hollows down curb plates along the dinosaur dam</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is so rare as a win in lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I know it, the better let it come.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The remains of the skin remains still the hollowly tank plates that wear the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers crossed it up.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the sheds at his sole. '</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the thunderstorm: massage arambolage on A8: many injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">Hot accident on Thursday night on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, miles long stout - and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the late Thursday afternoon of the Stuttgart-Munich (A8), some 20 people died on the late Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first information of the police, at 17.00 o'clock between the airports of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg), during a thunderstorm, some 30 vehicles, including trucks, were probably also trucks.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Initially, there were no information regarding the exact number of injured parties.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was mild to moderate injuries, said a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large number of bailout vehicles was on the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 is completely closed in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of Munich a roughly ten kilometres of retreat was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As a AZ reporter reported, there was also a massive handicap - through numerous Gaffs.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The firefighters noted the trademarks of the vehicle levers, which now have to count with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 o'clock the second accident happened on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">In doing so, it was a collision between an Autotrantransporter and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A bailout driver was on the road to the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testet "Comfort Check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is sitting in turn and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or it is deepens in his work and has just a brilliant thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffered.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes from the workflow and arouses a improper or rips the bike in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the most reliable driving position control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm your place by mobile, that you have taken his seat, so that the ticket may be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, one test mode runs on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"comes the offer, as we extend it.</seg>
<seg id="1997">It is expected to be available at many other traffic routes in Germany at the beginning of next year, "said a train narration.</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" calls the rail links without a job.</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to use it, however, some requirements need to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have booked an online ticket - what is going to do for most passengers already.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It also has to be bought by rail, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last one needs a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works: you get into the train, calling its ticket below "My tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">The test customers then appears a button to get the electronic validation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train station received a message on their mobile devices that Fahrgast X is located on the train and the booked seating area Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Comes along with driver control at place Y, it knows that there is a passenger with already indexed online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So one can continue to sleep, continue to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - which is to use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who simply wants to travel without ticket control by our train station personnel, check the DB Navigator software itself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This allows the passengers to design their travel time in the train personal, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Management Board of DB Remote traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often go railway, knows that beside delays and missed trains, the ticket checks are among the biggest sleeves.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often, one of the fellow travelers do not have all documents in any case, which one needs for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you must indicate.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result are endless discussions between train station and ride, which leads to bad mood in the gate or large space and delays in control of your own tickets and takes care of the works at the end time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this also applies to the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart food.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Additional access numbers on the same track are not enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, St. Louis was born on the bed of an Airbnb-apartment, which she rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post by someone from High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police had just killed just a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street." he named him there.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused when nobody else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly prayed on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the St. Louis region was there, death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., was killed in a tweet.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's leblosem body, which was outstretched on the road and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," thought to herself.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She gave her mobile phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield drive later on the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police tape and people, who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be Browns's father, who carried a sign with the wording: "Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed in which a policeman stood before a group of protesters with a rebellious dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, assured another policeman his rifle and cried: "I will kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell recalled its statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"that is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and which we can call it typical."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment, I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she repeated her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided to drive the two next morning to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell ran with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a matching crown, the two will have a conversation, which they had innumerable times before this morning "on the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"do you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she reminded of what she said.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson, because the police has killed a 18-year-old boy, and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take it, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It needs to know and see it and be reared.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do in order to free us.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I'm lucky, you have experienced an experience in which they do not experience any serious racism, it is no different than the next black Women's child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel, I would give you a poor service to keep them off. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson, located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a campground, as the activists waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter associated with a local business partner who had lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new type of activism for fermentation.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communes.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar realized only "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to the sense: "would you be documenting or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by people from people, often from the White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan explained recently in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised up their voices have not been centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had co-collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism on his activism.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The project gave birth to Ferrell, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after the generosity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me as these people are depicted, because I will be depicted."</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferghs's experience - to show that it is in motion "not for a Messiah who comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrowing's life as she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but I understood that there must be some vulnerable during this work and in the creation of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells history repeats the role of the black gay women in the wider black-lives match movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of movement, who have marked the film "BlacklivesMatter," in social media in 2012, identifying himself as a gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are fighting on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women have to carry out the main burden of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement was really held in black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not a affirmative type of action," in the fermentation of their identity as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook her energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's not a coincidence, even though it was at the front of the front, because there is a lot of life in these clashes as a black, gay woman is so much on the stake.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the rattest links between the community and police have continued to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Fermentation is on probation for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social and political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she slowed at a singing and she feels committed to this memory, since she went into Ferguson on the road three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love one another, and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - save our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" up to "size": TV readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the South of the pedestrian zone has been obsolete since the first time in 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The theme hardly can be cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">This topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one-bit gallery said: "this would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be a real class" (Nicole Gisten), comes from the other side: "don't need a man" (Siggi bats) or quite simply: "magnitude!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates insisted that a gallery will attract more customers into the city, from which other businesses are benefited, fear the enemy that then the pedestrian zone has bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery will be focussed on the premises on which the farmers market stands, offering 13 direct marketing products to its products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will be concluded with the start of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - as a place to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we've been selling almost weekly in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm is always happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and above all, after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities, there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether you are direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery, arrives at the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But the new project will probably not be low. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the most shopping in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, dropping or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shops are vacated here - some have been for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">However, since there is not even a regular weekend market, it is the more important that at least the market stands remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly directly from the producer and is obstructible priced.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, shop businesses are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the dorm mids are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">It's a pity, special transactions there is almost no more and what is left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a Markthalle fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market go round during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even in duration if the bit-gallery soon arrives.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it make the Spectst Bit Gallery already to distribute all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And shopping center that stands empty, nobody needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real estate market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant hall, it's quite a place thanks to the mad many - how to find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the Peasant hall is captured, a piece of culture will vanish. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: an artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the center of the fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, that are almost inconspicuous - that hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg made from cheeks and hair sections created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence service analyst banned a 35-year sentence after having admitted to the secret diplomacy reporting on behalf of WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August, means A Becoming Resemblance (Another similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondent between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline moved their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and a pioneering discretion, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that could be extracted from the 30 portraits, such as some intellectual comment not only about the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born in Bradley Edward, but has been convicted by the identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 because of 20 charges, among them six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Because of the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sitting on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde speaking with which she has been associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strange artifacts such as cigarette stills and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when they received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg on a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't visit this time and she couldn't be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal letters, which, in the course of two years, letters plainted several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic book published by Shoili Kanungo illustrate a comic strip published by Shoili Kanungo, who would be a future foreseen in which the President of Cheliquake would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was indeed just a few days after the book was published, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of happy meetings.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There are also now at the opening of the exhibition something deeper and strong, since Donald Trump leads a war against informant from the government camp and against transgender forces to find the rigid divisions which he should actually fix to flaming.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen out of a particular reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a description of the gallery written by the gallery, Manning called for "Manning with its supervent signature among them (the" i "in its family name) has been an end of the" automatic crash issues whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is the mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousanding of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hopes that the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist) show how surprising, at least in biological ways we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring to what is that our genome does not take care of who we are and like openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video production of 2007, Spurious Memories.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is one page from the mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she appears with a Freisprechtelefone in hand from the disciplines of the United States as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they declare your word in cold, then they have won," says it.</seg>
<seg id="2151">"keep never the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I'm still getting geese, when I speak of it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning had not seen the exhibition personally - as it was foreseen in the comic book - but when they should do it, it will be welcomed in the center of the space of the masks, from their own genomic Simulakren, who gather themselves together like hordes of Protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It was also aimed at the same time as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Mannings Stature), where their genetic hapsack was written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted it to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that deals with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of Northwestern University and a employee of the University of Oxford for murder</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunting is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who as suspects has been sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday the arrest warrants for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued warrants for murder of her alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau as the acquisition of the Cook's Local Court.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau died, 26, after several bullets.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A general warning system, published by the Chicago Police authority, revealed that the lyche was discovered on July 27.</seg>

<seg id="2165">Lathem has been associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. cuban, the vice-president for the university relations, said in an e-mail explanation that Lathem has now been indoors and ruled by the University of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal issue which is examined by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University collaborates on this investigation," Cubbage.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Management Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail explanation that "we are in contact with the police in the UK, and ready to help the U.S. investigators in every conceivable way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens colleagues were shocked and want to put himself up.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police authority of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he demands the suspects of the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police has an idea of their place, and our efforts to localize them," said Guglielmi.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said, the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, said that in the apartment 1008 was something happened.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as a very cruel man.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident happened on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe Professor Latham and the sacrifice of a relationship," said Guglielmi.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents: "the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim, and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will shut off the WADA roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Vice-president Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">The Russian vice-president Vitaly Mutko said that it won't last long until the remaining criteria of the world anti-doping Agency (WADA) for restoration of Russian anti-doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"in a certain stage of fulfilling the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and testing in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="2183">The WADA-timetable has been updated in this respect, "Mutko declared on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for reinstatement of RUSADA and recently published on the website's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could give concern for Russia occasion.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything was announced, everything is implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2187">And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future, "added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities allowed the approval of the WADA approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly owned government sponsored dopings in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">In terms of the matter, mutko says: "we conduct the study because our anti-doping system has put an error.</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">But there were no government programs, and we will not admit something that exists. "</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutkos recorded words with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with Russian sales agency RSports at the beginning of the day Smirnov was problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Nobody has failed to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the Doping skandals from the WADA by implementing Doping control in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">You were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">Following a visit to the organisation of the organisation in Moscow in July, WADA-Director Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA moved into the right direction "to be used again.</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new race of human resources start-ups is on waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Due to the preparation and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee involvement, it enables companies to offer surveys, special groups and demographic groups to deal with employees Anonymity and complaint-hotlines, and in some cases, Whistleblowers allow the C-suite managers to deal directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you have now tools like Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment.</seg>

<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report an issue, he or she had to find a number or email for corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said that there was no good way to follow the discomforts of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company converts Convercent, problems confronted by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states were hidden, such as Discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - quicker and addressed.</seg>

<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors, which also supports both startups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Converting was received $10 million at funding in February by firms like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the whole capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer's partner, bringing its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">This investment is hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex in research that shows that today's employees expect more than so far.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high levels of salaries and interesting projects are just wagers.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want the feeling that you are accepted and estimated that you give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to be in a company that's happy to be in a company, and that the work you do is worth, then they feel more strongly committed to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience in LinkedIn, which will be used as well as Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach rendings if their portfolio business is well running. companies run well if employees are involved and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools promise third party, commitment and deployment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on the employee's commitment after the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">However, the data are useless when the Administrator of a company take no measures.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees according to your feedback, it can have a expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change isn't fast enough, or at all, this disappointments and employees can motivate them.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 ideas, you must be willing to have 4,000 interviews," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen the company that can rely on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"for if you do not follow," Do you really hear me? "</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about that?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you do not care about why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who passes the pits of the monthly staff polls, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint as you do.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to re-organize more teams within the business and to add several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In Ruby Tuesday the company always receives new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in a long run, this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector that is known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," said Vitrano.</seg>

<seg id="2259">NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the brood-ins</seg>
<seg id="2260">It starts at 23: 00 when a lot of UCLA Footballers are on one side of the new exercise fields of the team in the campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have moved their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team, these unusually minutes represent a lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are inscribed in the summer courses will return to their final tests after the 3-hour practice before they return to the water football Center next morning at 6: 30 PM.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"for the guys the next three days a real trek mill," Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora said shortly before the Monday was on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and it has effectively extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore the first three training sessions of the UCLA at 19: 15 will start to meet the players already completed.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood-ins postponed during the last season almost a week after the last season, during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playing times in Westwood.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They will conclude at the course of August 18 exercises. 20 before the start of formal preparations for their prelude against Texas A & M in September.</seg>
<seg id="2269">MORA said he will support the rule of NCAA, even if they add another point-up routes to the players.</seg>
<seg id="2270">"we put this enormous burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"and they just pushed it, they placer continue, they are great people.</seg>
<seg id="2272">I think once we come up to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great. "</seg>
<seg id="2273">The UCLA will stop their practices as soon as the camp is finished, what is being thrown at the clear branch of its fields of an adjacent parking and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upper class that has already cleared a protective cover behind a torpist, no easy task will be.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Brood-players should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem, once this room are free during the season.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will use our security," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="2276">"it is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that the people rent a room there and then you can choose to record a exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2277">If you have the video of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.</seg>
<seg id="2278">But we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8.</seg>
<seg id="2279">We will do the best, with what we have.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-1980 and 1980-he was a sipushch.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his comfortable sitting in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now the inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I think it's so beautiful to look at the signature of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another, upcoming British artist - Isaac Lasiewicz, Brighy May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responding to the Daumenabdruck at the side of a letter which was written by a double player in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his Daumenabdruck!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell as smoke, because at that time one burnt fire due to the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has a effect than it would be for himself.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Ah, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who has been beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England, and has lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I took my welcome dig a little over") it seems to be all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, like the mounted hymns on the walls and the bottles that spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated to the grounds and ruins of the old castle, and spoke with farm care, gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, he drank, he drank "whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was first received the full access in 2006 than the last one, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes met a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which Aristocrats spoke" Oh, wirf it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empires, maps that pose what had: "you could mean that land-conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let all go their gear! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base to look at a broader base in the English history, among them 'The Labourer', who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a riot that occurred 1380 in the castle, in this book titled 'Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant farm began in this area and I thought a insurrection was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two connected to each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', telling the history of the Jesuit patrons, the family hid seven years long during the English reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', portrayed in the Egyptian Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, filled his own burial by filled a sardine with stones (a discovery that was only dug for years later than his Sarg was dug out).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen appeared to be fitting, always turn debts and spend money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men soles their debt crisis by giving rich elderly women - I present them as a heap of fine-looking boys, with a talent to advertise landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his engagement in the castle, Rhodes in search of other unique write experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Eldges, the grounds of a sanatorium in the early 20th century, which has then returned from nature again.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go back," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2322">It was like this: "Oh, now I must be finished with the condemned life."</seg>
<seg id="2323">A campaign launched: over 300 years old Lady chapel in Rhöndorf</seg>

<seg id="2337">Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Each year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (Yas) consits about retirement and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">This is how this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">On the first sight a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine for the Turkish dispute a year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The session took place no longer in the building of the general Staff, as previously, but in the prime minister of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">On the deliberations under the leadership of the government, the five Vice Premiers, as well as the Minister of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2344">In this way, civilians were killed in the Yas.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government forces the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commander of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were removed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, Prime Minister Erdogan has fired 169 of 326 Generals and Admira since the failed coup.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of concurrent connections to the move of the exile-Preacher Fethullah Gülen who sees Erdogan as a wire of the putsch attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">486 people who were allegedly involved in the putsch attempt, will have been negotiated there in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan has designated a "divine present" as he had given him the opportunity to clean the armed forces. "</seg>
<seg id="2351">But has Erdogan really touched the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">In late February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Discomfort" in the Military Headquarters. "</seg>
<seg id="2353">At the general Staff, there are concerns because of an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifest themselves among other things in the lifting of head ban for Soldators, the newspaper wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Anyway, the great cleaning case in the army and the security forces goes on.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan introduced another 7395 police officers, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed, when Erdogan is tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">Generals were earlier than the actual lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">She collects thrice three times, calling for her role as a guard of the worldly State Code.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan urged the power of the military to step back, not least for the reform of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is managing director of armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a previously-called officer, who was seeking asylum after the coup attempt in foreign countries abroad, the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and oafists" in few years.</seg>
<seg id="2362">That is true, however, that NATO might not abandon Nato.</seg>
<seg id="2363">Anyway, there is doubts in the alliance with the purge of the service of the Turkish army.</seg>

<seg id="2368">The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"this law will reduce poverty, save wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by way of changing the way of citizens from other countries of Green Cards."</seg>
<seg id="2371">The law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system.</seg>

<seg id="2374">Over the past few months has been fought over the future of the racing shuttle bus - now it's supposed to be quick.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Before the end of the year there is to be a round trip, which drives the Tourist Railroad.</seg>
<seg id="2376">To secure the future of the road transportation to the long-term, according to the local ministry of the public sector, construction work is scheduled to start in this year.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to continue to order and sanitation the circuit of Ilmenau-Rennes, the country is also important for the tourism important link," declared the state Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the maintenance of the distance decreased to about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">From this sum, the country took 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered to be ordered in the future, will be ultimately voted, declared Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The ministry and the South African train as operators are already involved in the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"therefore, the roadmap, that used vehicles and quality standards," said Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a duration of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That the race-Shuttle will take regular stays on December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The race track shuttle is an especially popular rail link between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennes.</seg>
<seg id="2386">During the past few months, in the course of a pilot operating system, the distance of sufficient many people had been used to support them again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The route is also highly dilapidated in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be cracked in 2017, a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robot happens.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) released a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus Professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their ascent seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the robot color of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey to the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern legends have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone-retina that feels warm, with deliberately human reactions that will be achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can adjust its robots according to their beliefs, "and select it all, from the robot color of the robot to the form of nipples, up to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it's more worried as many robots possess the "personalities," which would look like a progressive woman of progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern legends have evolved into robots with a silicate.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Realix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties, which they find it attractive, for example, relying relying.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of relatidness and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality who is adapted to your personality as good as possible," keeps the website of true companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, it also has its moods - quite as real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can be "in mood!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underptive female properties, the responds to rape, if one goes on a step on Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah is on worrisome one of the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, true companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men do not have a Roxxxy?" it's on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sexist.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and its increasing refinement boast a little darker and deeper conditions in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of Gender equality in a desire for sex with subjugation as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, will have no sex robot, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain temporary in the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leakened out of the boundary zones may be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive, until the free market gives permission to them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">However, there is certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robot in a time emerge in which the rights of women are threatened by women worldwide, in which the White House gives a presidents who has preceded to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most detest aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maidservant ') are not the graphical pictures, the swallowed up body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots there is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their inheritance would like to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, on the point, when it comes to their "personalities", robots represent no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can't separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total subjectivity.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Unlike expressed: they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the language of 2017: maid service</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of healthy human rights</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binary of the Trump era, that the political divisions, which have polarizes the U.S. voters, have also divided families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest thanksgiving, the United States played newspapers with suggestions about how to deal with the horror of Trump's election.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all supposed to have all of us to burst our filtration noses.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticing is the power of Trumps, to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I will mention this because my cousin, a left-directed poet that lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, who visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me of that the unity of a common enemy may have a mighty effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the Republican Movement, with which she had fought for decades due to politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks associated with itself.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the exhaustive effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the possibility of having no more abduced his cookies from one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a frightened long-term scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalizes" which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards suddenly as epitome of deceitfulness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find me nowadays from a active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's funny version of the backdrop - the dog on the car's roof, which looked 14% of income tax (but at least we knew how its tax returns) - both in comparison to trump in fact occur to a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes down, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only spiritually healthy to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the town was, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the caroutway of the New York park department, and the top three dollars you can spend in the city when you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crurrig, and the animals are rotating in order to look at full fear of her own shoulders - extremely dark and the limiting music is a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many marclichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city is not just to the dream.</seg>

<seg id="2490">Software update for diesel vehicles: what those affected have to know now</seg>
<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers within an overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">They are to improve the emissions of emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4-diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin is published by the ACE Auto Club Europe for assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new promotion mandatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the processed software updates are optional.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the mandatory updates have previously applied for the vehicles," says Anja Smetanin. "</seg>
<seg id="2501">Their retrofitting has arranged the Federal Aviation Office (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed of updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">Manufacturers have announced an effective implementation in the next few months, but not yet called exact date.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has informed that everyone should be concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If anyone is due to an inspection, this will be settled in its context.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long should the modifications go down?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"hard to say," says Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2508">This is from the commitment of the manufacturer and from political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"because we have seen, the automakers do not deal with the subject of environment so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long will the update take?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The rearmament itself could only last three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time-consuming can be to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What are drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE must wait for you.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Probably foreign manufacturers would pull out, so Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Is there a massive price of Euro-4 cars?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE detaileth this.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But just in the regions where the dead people threaten.</seg>
<seg id="2519">In rural areas there is no value-loss for older diesel.</seg>
<seg id="2520">The ACE advised to wait for a sale yet.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbauxetaker, goes to Rente this coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The job is already written - but the application is rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">For the last 31 years, Wacker City Councillors has been.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still great fun, as he is communicated in a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">It reports varied, but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successors.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it surprises him that so far no application forms the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the next possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - respecting the regular cancellation period - yet enough time for a job.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach has been responsible for the administrative community as a subordinator authority, the applicant must demonstrate appropriate connections.</seg>
<seg id="2544">This function wants to keep the town forever.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If you do not fill this anymore, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the town is also important to him, says Wacker who tells of a good company climate as well as a good mood between authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">In more than 30 years in office several major projects have accumulated, and the Wacker is looking back with pride.</seg>

<seg id="2549">But in the future, varied projects are also available on the agenda: the remodelling of the former Hukla Areas and the underground parking place are angled.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The kinetic bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, also the stadium restoration is still subject.</seg>
<seg id="2551">The latter is going to befall with around 1.5 million euros alone, "when we're doing it right," Wacker estimates.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">Work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Was stricken for a citymaster of great play space.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslachs own building yard and gardening can be justified rather flexibly.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move much," so Wacker, and the creation of the green areas will often be commendable by citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town stands as ensemble under monument protection, it is important to have "an eye to have what purges," when newbuilds are approved, the separating city master.</seg>
<seg id="2558">The town of Stadtbauxion has high responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">It is building company, "at the end everything is going on my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">For assistance and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (high-construction) has been around for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been working for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also, his successor is long, Wacker wants to follow: "we are looking for someone who really identifies and remain with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Because continuity is not only important for a good working environment, but also for the other design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Those who want to bury Roland Wacker should, according to the town of Haslach, should present a degree in architecture as a diplomat or Bachelor in architecture, and have good knowledge of knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planners.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The StadtbauOffice understand high and civil engineering, construction planning, or underline affairs, administration of urban communities, urban farm with building yard and municipal gardening as well as a municipal law, including monument protection.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Tossed bike on lines: ground circuit locked</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to police, the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail route in the Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were badly damaged, however, to be considered to be a suitable freight train.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go from two male stoves and search for the night hours after them.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Near the crime scene there were witnesses of a bright rooters and a bike driver.</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond the Lausitz region," said ÖBB narrator Christoph Posch to APA.</seg>
<seg id="2571">The perpetrators, or the perpetrators, would have brought themselves into great danger and also endangered the traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2572">In addition to the damage caused by the Lok and plant, and the delay, and the costs for rail transport, too, too much of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2573">It was said to be a "considerable" sum, "said the spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damages were fixed on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south railway line could be guided without disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Almost ten guests were pleased to enjoy Friday morning, two of which looked at the correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Goods were not made, but they didn't have any delay.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to the ÖBB narrator, Christoph Posch had to be exchanged around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (Flammable peroxide)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts the exact opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom of 300,000, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected will usually come to alleviate meat and dairy products in order to relieve their symptoms, researchers found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins contribute to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The explorer, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells are patched in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hide themselves in the food, do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are able to emulate inflammation, are compensated by cells, promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is inclined towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a kind of tolerance constriving immuncells in mice was prescribed by a certain bacterium in its initiators.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a link between a bacteria type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbial, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan who had mice in their food, the more they had had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an intryptophan rich nutrition tolerant, less inflammatory bowel disease, if the same system is raving for people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell who found tolerance as they found out that a group of study mowers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separately accommodated, this had not had.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were sequenced, and there were six bactericiaries found in mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were fostered in an sterilous environment so that they did not have a gut microbiome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria grow on the immune system, the researchers added L. reuteri in a liquid and then led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerating cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component has been cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of the tryptophan metabolic, known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerating cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri found the cells in men as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote because these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in presence of L. reuteri lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2605">At Manchester United made a "Genie" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder on Wednesday evening had his debut at Sampdoria.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The Chelsea last 40 million Pound signed from Chelsea started with a 2: 1 win in Dublin, the last preseason game before the UEFA Cup Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed even more impressive in the holders role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.</seg>
<seg id="2607">Matic was excluded from the capture-Asia tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes to improve Mourinho, that he had to improve the Premier League season before the beginning of the Premier League season.</seg>
<seg id="2608">"he needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.</seg>
<seg id="2609">"we will help him sooner than later."</seg>
<seg id="2610">In addition to Matic started Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku in the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho his start-XI formed for the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three other new mandatory, but he insisted that the club has made a "fantastic job," three of his four prime ministers.</seg>

<seg id="2615">The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliners in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="2616">The pilots flew over Seattle in Washington State, but drawing began in Marquette in US state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dreamliners about the USA, which are several thousand kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="2617">The action took 18 hours and a minute.</seg>
<seg id="2618">On the railers, the shape of a dreamliners was to be.</seg>
<seg id="2619">The whole was a lasting test for new engines.</seg>

<seg id="2622">New proposal for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2623">As the wind is yet twisted: as Sigmar Gabriel still left SPD leader, Socialist and Democrat Prime Minister always looked after elections with a certain concern to Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Merely none of the storytale from the party headquarters, merely no counterwind from the covenant - so the most important option of the election fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz takes the party, this fundamentally changed.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then, the employees from the Willy-Brandt-House are watching the events in the SPD-governing capitals.</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year, with headwinds, would not even be described in the approach.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were deep strikes.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="2630">The Federal CDU is looking for the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this shows once more: red-green is simply not reliable," said the CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial office network of Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising leader of a Green Party suffered from the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) plunged into a serious crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the Sunday dial, its red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition of CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green Party executive leader Michael Kellner ordered the Anglo-Saxon Green Party of Elke Tjackets to return to its mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The crossing to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Elke Tests must immediately return its mandate, "said the Federal Executive Officer and campaigns of the Green Party on the editorial network Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2637">"it must not be true, however, a SPD campaign to be sighted when on Friday morning the new Job government had reached the party headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is standing for the spring of the green majority of Elke Tjackets to the CDU without its own government majority.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary highlight of an entire series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what next comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Miser started a clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, more, more appeals the comrades of the time.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After the legislative elections of Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.</seg>
<seg id="2644">This was then - and it became much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel took the support for the SPD, the Düsseldorf-Pleite cut down the party smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="2646">With difficulty, comrades came back in the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when they had been holding new courage, the G-20 summit was of Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And the next stroke also came with him.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD Landeschef, lost its Nimbus in that weekend, because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his town burned.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because he had so wrong in crisis communication so pretty everything you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz fights for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Because of the VW emission experts and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been criticized in criticism.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Miese refractional values were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Nevertheless, or maybe because, because in recent weeks, because in recent weeks, he always tried to put on the covenant of accents.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The ambition of the former Mayor of Hannover, its power in Berlin, remained not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him grant him, because they made themselves a stabilisation of the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">In doing so, because of the internal compultery, the Anglo-Saxon Greens is basically no fault.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz are not even afraid.</seg>
<seg id="2661">Sometimes the comrades make an effort to keep up their own ranks.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Their anger directs to the Greens, and in particular on the isolated Parliamentarians in Tjackets.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and Democrat democracy, such as Ms. Tjackets her own carriculating interests on the interests of all the others," says Matthias Miersch, chief of partitions in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the editorial network Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Ms. Tlifejackets not been elected for its person as a direct candidacy, but has been elected to parliament by the Anglo-Saxon Green Party.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that they return to their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thomas Oppermann, chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group, complains a "undemocratic maneuver."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"the vote of voters off four years ago was clear: people have made Stephan Weil's prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony candidate to the Bundestag election to the RND.</seg>
<seg id="2668">"now, the personal kariteration of a future CDU MPs set out the election results," Oppermann said further.</seg>
<seg id="2669">He demanded to clarify the backgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="2670">I want to know if there have been more or more ongoing additions to the CDU Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="2671">Conveying capacity for Ortskiers III</seg>
<seg id="2672">Those who want to renovate his life in the years can now be obtained from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In addition, Mayor of Albert Schindler and three representatives of steg city development on Wednesday in sensations.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review to the events so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991 it has been given in sensations of rehabilitation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Baden-Württemberg country took over two-thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the renovation region II from 2005 to 2016, the supply was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - it is finally important to promote the internal development and not only build new building sites.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, you will receive the information from the Government of Government in Karlsruhe, giving it a renovation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount totals 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 euros would be from the country, the rest of the municipality's sensations.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a renovation area then?</seg>
<seg id="2682">One will continue to investigate if Schindler died, where the "really old" houses are.</seg>
<seg id="2683">It plays an important role, whether in the planned field, concern itself to sanitify.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the area borders may then move again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The Steg arrived on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Cellars presented the contents of the federal state programme "Social City," in which framework will be carried out in the framework of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Core of the program are the revitalisation of internal towns, improving the residential and labour conditions and preservation and infrastructure of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be objective, that is, per plot, carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The renovation area would then be established as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The eligibility period for funding has been running since January 1, 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">However, until September this year, however, the existing order intake would only be carried out in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation region involved.</seg>
<seg id="2692">As of November or December, as possible as possible of the propositional label, it will be possible to begin with the renovation in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann then declared that each commune had to carry out the said pre-publication investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It's about to evaluate the urban abnormalities, and decide how to be sanitized and in which girth.</seg>
<seg id="2695">It will also be registered for the property also a renovation merk in the basic book.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will once again come to sensations and make himself a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasized, an essential success factor for the project is the participation of those involved.</seg>
<seg id="2698">That is why there will be questionnaires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The yellow questionnaire is the "building and plot-piece" which, among other things, concerns the structural condition and sanitary intentions.</seg>
<seg id="2700">In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing", data can be made up to size, splitting and residents of a living room.</seg>
<seg id="2701">The blue "business arch" is only to fill in the premises of business premises.</seg>
<seg id="2702">However, to note, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">New structural measures are not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler was still stressed that the distribution of funding was functioning after the "Winddog principle" - who first comes first.</seg>

<seg id="2714">The promotional fees of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands</seg>
<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a marine Lawn to the South Lawn for an event which highlights the American manufacturing of the last month, costs taxpayers to the information of the military, which were up to the TIME Magazine, up to 24.000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Naval One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter designed in Connecticut was issued by a yacht from Maine, a firefighter from Wisconsin and a forklift truck.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House's military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter arrives on the South Lawn, following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 o'clock in the morning to the South Lawn for the event at 15 o'clock and so long remained until the Lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if your departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original air-crew remained during the event during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The notes provided by the TIME were not clear, if ultimately, a second flight crew was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal funds, government property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Datasets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could violate the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts, and we were informed about that this was not the case," wrote the commander.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"it sounds as if you are locked up," he replied the Deputy Commander.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was declared by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the president gave a violation of reform of health reform, which was in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to constrain the government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft, known as the Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obligated to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But its use only for a photo-operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">Trump led an investigation into an investigation when the presidential airplane was powered by the background of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services and his Twitter account is full of messages that complained about the use of its presidential jet by its predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is thrilled with the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said the vice-president of the White House, Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to cancel the US President in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 led to the White House 58 exercise sessions.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The flight for the "Made in America" event numbered for the month's training needs for the month, said an official.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopter units flew 11 hours on this day for "non-presidential support committees."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that the taxpayers were not the burden for any of the other props which were presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman by Sikorsky said the company had not been involved to stop the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not have budgets for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to Stundentarization of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD replacement set for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Record of the unit shows the flight time of the plane than 30 minutes from the Navy, Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argued that the actual costs for operation of the helicopter is far below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"it is highly misleading," said Walters. "the costs for the taxpayers are based on the basis of procurement rules.</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include staff, maintenance, and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual resources."</seg>
<seg id="2749">According to a RAND study from 2015, refunds for DoD do not include personnel costs, but also take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract.</seg>
<seg id="2750">At this time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present these week of things that are made in America," said Spicer.</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent.</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which many Americans have tirelessly worked.</seg>
<seg id="2754">It is, of course, reasonable to emphasize it. "</seg>
<seg id="2755">It was not clear whether Trump was interacted with the helicopter, when he entered the event via the South Lawn to the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a firefighter.</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about its own fleet of corporate products.</seg>
<seg id="2757">"I know Sikorsky very good," said the President, "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="2855">GMB-Senior-organizer Drew Duffy, said: "the fact that we can win no clarity over the needs of the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross, concerns our members.</seg>
<seg id="2856">Generations of families have worked here and the workforce are concentrated on the local community and the large space of Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.</seg>

<seg id="2893">It would be much to serve the Catholic Church's reputation, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret about their submissions, or at that time, wrong assessment of the processes would express.</seg>
<seg id="2894">By contrast, the Vatican fund "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that in the report about violence at the domestay of "two measures" was measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">In terms of grips in Regensburg, no one knows that it would have to be "shameful and shameful deeds," but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics-Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habits, the Catholic Church as well as source of all the plague, is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria from Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one likes to go on to the church and this is a little fresher."</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "blows were a completely normal pedagogic agent" to be done with naughty children, as I was one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair, today setting standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope John Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger on the memory band "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Eemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he considers the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report, which was presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domsparrows were sexually violated between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s. "with high plums" victims of overcoming, 67 domestrows are sexually violated.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 until 1994: "in summary, it is obvious that Domkapellmeister R. was applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotional motionality, the punishment of the students could also fail.</seg>
<seg id="2907">By contrast, in contrast to numerous other claims, many victims will invaluable and in many cases, despite violence even positive memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Eemann says, why the final report on the scure scandal at the Regensburg-sparrows Georg Ratzinger is on his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Violence of Violence in the" Establishment of Justice, "gives a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one raise, many students produce his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it appears as choleriker and perfectionist, which became the efight, if a domain saving was no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you use this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you read the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Violence processes in the pre-school also took place outside of its active sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to throw at him if late, experienced, or first attempts to have taken seriously either.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domination of Dometymers, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all those surveyed ("salvation," "Heaven" and "Better World."</seg>
<seg id="2918">So the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent witness, describes it as "hot-hearted," "sinful," "excellent," "competent," and "intellious", as an extremely good-talented teacher, who provided the guys regularly with cakes, cookies and candy seeds. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complained about his Perfectism and its high emotional erneness, which led also to Wutout.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only beat with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also earneyed and exclaimed guys to the hair or ears he himself had regretted, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honoring, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, far from parents like in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone from us, who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and the non-violence on the pre-school, they are liberating.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it did not dare to do with his mind and role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just thrown on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, many people who never understand it, are still alive and eagerly.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report drafted Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, there was a lot about misuse of the issue of abuse with the Regensburger Domsparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also put any processing or compassion on sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Eemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never looked at me, to talk to my father or mother about it," said an affluous representative for the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the declaration of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not trust even parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorus leader, who certainly would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Dominion-Student Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which it had had foreseen (Georg Ratzinger) and could have had the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I hold it... even for a truly absurd, presumed that itself... Bubs must have opened etrently or more uniform, than compared to their parents, internatants, confidentiality, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">This report comes to the very clear result: "in the run-affected students and / or their surrounding area, he could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">What concerns sexual abuse is Georg Ratzinger so free from each other.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it cannot be charged, either prevented, or brought him to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Hence, there is no reason to bring its good name with these conflicting crimes, as it was unfortunately occurred in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, there was a lot of "non-violence" to read in the Regensburger Domjab.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of having taken a look at his report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and menstrued to a huge melange from sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle of, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly what a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There will be clean separately: between the school and school of the cathedral-sparrows, between sexual abuse and non-violence as well as, we say, other penalties.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report incidents from the period since 1945, thus also out of four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral leader of the cathedral factory.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The entire horrible investigational pedagogy, the cases in which boys were rightly spelled and malnourished, were all involved in elementary school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skinned conditions have to have dominion.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boy only to face when they were already on the cathedral sputter school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the same way, as most witnesses came, the theme of "Preschool" is tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise of paradise."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domino Sheet school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but not a distic force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims will invaluable the general humanity of R., and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence even linked positive memories."</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at the most, the accusation is left out.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods of time, in which it was reported in the lecture at the Preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself, and from the predecessors at a school where he had not worked and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Closed Georg Ratzinger in front of the conditions consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann says: no, since in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral spinnymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this point, it indicates that "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In the face of negatively negatively pressibility, he recommended more urgent income.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was long-forbidden in Bavaria in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before, they took place in a legal grey zone, just like everyone knows of us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also hard to estimate, where the victims were exaggerated or dramatised, and where really the permitted limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say, he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is simply not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria from Thurn und Taxis said it was unfair to address modern educational standards at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Eemann: we speak historians about the "Fallentanism of Anachronism," meaning the danger to assess the past today's moral measures.</seg>
<seg id="2975">She was quite right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But that of course not for sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of rebellious and violence against innocent children, which goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible, and I'm glad that it finally works.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protecting, for all this had nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its funds for disciplinating and punishment, i.e. earplugs and ears to draw near the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was banned, he also stripped himself.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What is the picture of his rainy days, George Ratzinger has been reprinted with you for the book "My brother of the Pope."</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic test relate to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the cathedral sparrows played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not wear it by no means, that he led a stringent regime there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But also this must be said: without this perfectionism, without being undemanding discipline, it would probably have been possible to form a institution of World trang, true cultural ambassador in Europe and its musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and candy alone, one does not make up a big singer and before every success, right in the field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As for a person, you have experienced George Ratzinger during our talks at their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition I have met George Ratzinger very well and always experienced as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and heart-good people, from which you could not imagine that he could only do a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly updated, like many former Domestic reservations still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him - he is almost blind - and he is almost blind and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him today that he once was strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domestrows are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and communicated the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, vicious teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to whom they still look at and to glorify it.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: everything you need to give to him are educational methods which were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and a more prominent brother to make a medial sin-corn.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which has just been published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the arrival area, a 93-year-old man, who had acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably know not to know the Regensburger Domsparrows, finally to peace in peace.</seg>
