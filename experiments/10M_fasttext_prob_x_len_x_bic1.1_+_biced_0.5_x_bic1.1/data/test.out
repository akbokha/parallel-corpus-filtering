gol@@ fer Lang@@ er gets the sports pyr@@ am@@ ids
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lang@@ er was looking for a little variety with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after a few minutes the horses remembered her holiday , they hun@@ ted in fast gal@@ lop by home to feed .
a kilometer at this temp@@ o , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and thus the riding career ended up again too .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best golf course - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses .
he led himself to his family via the plant of AL@@ RV , on a horse he won &apos;t take up for photo purposes .
the first time in Aachen was the first time in Aachen , this was the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sporting assistance provided to the man from An@@ hausen at a small gala in the Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
it is not a lack of awards in the symp@@ a@@ thetic sport@@ sman .
Federal Ro@@ wing Cross , silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even British Queen already knew him .
long the 18th winner of the Sport@@ pyramid is pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first winner of Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award is a great deal , &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; because it is not only granted for spor@@ tive achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades , Lang@@ er promotes the offspring .
and so he won the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the double US master &apos;s winner was induc@@ ted into the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
in addition to the subscri@@ bers , the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ nar@@ ch , the painter Peter Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the Rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ ö@@ hle and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ ball of all Erhard .
many of these sports events were come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , this illustr@@ ate company emigrated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lang@@ er held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent trading agreement T@@ TP - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , none of the two US presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
the , on the role of the state .
tr@@ ump tries to keep the doubts rather small and warns against what the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to pun@@ ish the economy and regulate death , he says .
he himself would be quite different against it , claimed Tr@@ ump .
he will continue to reg@@ ain massi@@ vely , and he makes himself strong for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates - for private professionals and for companies .
Clinton said : the state has certain duties to fulfil , he has open the dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money .
so the tax would increase to the rich , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
to be invested in the needs , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost like that .
the applicant has not announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are stri@@ pped by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wings of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
at Tr@@ ump , there could be still party @-@ internal discussions .
more significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and back up the coal mining in the US .
oil promotion should also be possible in so protected areas , the Paris climate agreement wants to cancel .
Clinton wants to expand the renewable energy with its investment program , and demands : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of the clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ i@@ azi@@ ja trade agreement , do not want to sign .
at the same time both they want to is@@ olate themselves from international trade , but just protect American jobs .
they should then be paid even better , Clinton said .
the present minimum wage of $ 7,@@ 25 is a hunger strike .
it wants to increase it down to $ 15 per hour .
what tr@@ ump do in that question isn &apos;t quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to rise , then he says he shall not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the tax policy of both bearings .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , which wants to stim@@ ulate the economy and citizens to stim@@ ulate growth .
his critics stop him , that the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to ask at least of the rich , wants to pay more taxes and their critics : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; any wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are alone , almost everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen four women sit .
each one has a baby , which is at most a year old .
one has laid her small son in his arm .
he gu@@ akes with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother is star@@ red on the tabl@@ etop .
until it not@@ ices that it is watched .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene doesn &apos;t work normal .
until one speaks to Katrin B@@ ahr .
it is the division of the Con@@ dro@@ bs business director , a vehicle for social help in Bavaria , and among others , dealing with the topic women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen have fled .
they live in the north of Munich , one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodation for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dem@@ bs signed the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s aid .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are none - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man before the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated : any woman who comes here is on her escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persecuted because they did torture or death , or because their families are sending them to Europe , &quot; they are telling them .
in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many are secretly ste@@ wed them , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experienced experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , hon@@ or@@ atory , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that is driving them away .
on the run it continues .
&quot; for example , tu@@ g to demand a bottle of water a sexual act is no r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end , as soon as they swim in Germany , explains , B@@ ahr .
even here , single women in refugee camps would often be considered to be min@@ d@@ ful and worse were ab@@ used .
this causes about 90 percent of women who live in the area of Munich , trau@@ mat@@ ised , appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot;
many women be so acc@@ ust@@ omed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the living , because the shame is too great . &quot;
since they often do not need to help , it only need more accommodations for them , calls for B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments for the accommodation of refugees are responsible .
on the question of whether they were lying about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is something similar to the governments of the governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , women were not being accommod@@ ated themselves , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press secretary of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle fran@@ ken , there are some common floors or own homes for single @-@ standing women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality , &quot; in the European Parliament , calls for women to be accommod@@ ated by men .
in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women will be hosted separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or women and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can come to - ongoing violence against women . &quot;
especially the shower room should be separately accessible and accessible to women , stands in the study .
how much the women feel of this protection need , you can read on the And@@ res , which is to be found on the Munich House .
he has been talking about since we have been around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
you could easily get a second house .
Regist@@ rar : demands on new labour measures
Deputy Assistant of assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their dispute relating to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested his entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour measures starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it would have been minister to decide on the concerns about the contract .
in July , assist@@ ants and medical students have agreed to agree on the ref@@ us@@ al of a contract that has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted for the elections .
in a letter to the members who was posted on Thursday night on Thursday , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained &quot; be@@ insi@@ sting peaceful &quot; problems , which led to the conclusion that the contract was rejected .
she said , &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC of directors agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and challenged first new negotiations . &quot;
in response to the silence of the government the J@@ DC &apos;s bure@@ au today announced a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a ongoing program of escal@@ ating labour which begins in early September .
the disp@@ utes led to the assistance of assistance in the year six times , the first overall fail@@ ures in the history of N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , came to the re@@ jection of the agreed contra@@ ctual conditions which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared the BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be adv@@ anta@@ geous and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jeremy Hun@@ t said that the treaty was introduced for physicians in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up the hands and pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes its Turkish counter@@ part in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I can &apos;t reject myself the impression that Ankara wants to take this reconciliation .
there was the hand , yes .
but Putin worked very narrow and radi@@ ated hardly any heat , even for its business conditions .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve .
the next day , a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved so much more than would never happen .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to signi@@ fy the opposite .
but one of Putin dis@@ sem@@ bled , sustainable cows showed that the government of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his execution : the down@@ ing of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow was imp@@ acted at the time .
Putin part@@ ed and accused Ankara to be content of Russia .
the delay was even greater , since it has been committed by a supposed boy@@ friend .
the Vet@@ r@@ w will be re@@ building up again , if not even impossible .
since November , the public opinion in Russia has changed .
for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media resulted in a severe , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed , the Turks would bear the blame for all .
the accus@@ ations of officials confirmed that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin was received from President Erdo@@ gan to exc@@ use which he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind win .
for Ankara , the benefits of a cease @-@ fire is clear in the hand .
Erdo@@ gan is primarily interested in all the friends that he can get after he failed last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat .
the terrorist attacks on Turkey took him also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban of charter flights that each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and char@@ ter@@ companies will be reli@@ eved if the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal route of the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television predic@@ ts cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are not permitted .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated this : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West , since its reaction to the attempted coup was considered a weak response .
for this purpose , persi@@ sting Gro@@ ll on the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is er@@ ased to benefit from cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and Turkey .
in Ankara , the Russian head of State won a bonus for the decision that he requested a coup d &apos;@@ etat for the elected Public Prosec@@ ution .
this is well @-@ understood for Moscow , which itself has a profound fear of regime .
the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace of the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one that once described me an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that get rid of the West and have been treated badly by the West .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , between the two still great differences exist .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently delivered the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support other sites .
it might be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of first discussions at the press conference , they said that they didn &apos;t even understand the subject .
the President of Turkey mi@@ ed it intenti@@ onally on a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize this .
there is no clear con@@ sensus about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey gave the Russian battle @-@ jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s President of the Bank , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back@@ office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
since then the Bank has dist@@ anced itself almost k@@ oll@@ ab@@ ated and had to be saved almost eight years ago .
brand R@@ BS &quot; brand members have used this time to protect other end users .
they supported the international sport with millions of pounds to Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not initi@@ alize .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B are references , the de@@ centr@@ alized head office and stock exchange to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other small brands for private banking , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our investment brand as well as the brand , among which our employees will be busy , as we now become more to a bank of brands . &quot;
as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became global brand .
I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but also local goals .
each of these brands will be completely different in its own communities for something completely different , and our employees will work among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue to continue its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ship and that it will increase the perception of various brands in his sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop into the Bank of brands , as we concentrate on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better Bank for customers ? &quot; said the President of Staff .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , when we said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched this brand .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you &apos;ll see many changes .
we can re@@ launch these stamps again , so I think that time has come .

I am very happy about it when it happened to New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20.000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the ju@@ bel when he takes the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction .

Russia Putin becomes Chief of Staff Sergei IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
Russian President Vladimir Putin released to release his Chief of Staff Sergei IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a lot of years in the close confidence circle of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport affairs .
in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin is saying that Putin have ordered Ivan@@ ov@@ s &apos;s dis@@ miss@@ al to his duties as chairman of the Russian President &apos;s President . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was substitute in 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn , he graduated in the Moscow International Relations Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , it is ( in Russian ) that he later was head of the gover@@ ning head and head of government officials .
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important role of government to support your activity as a state of law on legislation and controls to the implementation of your instructions .
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday with that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V asked about to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended as his successor .
do the sm@@ iling faces convince ?
this step was made mysterious in Moscow .
Serge@@ y IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a long time of a close confidence in Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin who was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff had come back at his own request .
but despite the smile of fle@@ eing for the cameras , few of them are convinced here , just before the parliamentary elections .
so this is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion , that a man , who once praised himself as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed on great scep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks related to Putin , who are cited on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V said &quot; it &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation with this very complicated post - you could almost tell - compl@@ ained about four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the position in December 2011 .
before he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Constitutional Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was appointed his deputy .
when Putin got to power he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people he trusted in most .
once it was said that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V could be President of Russia &apos;s second term , as a third term of putting Putin to the constitution .
but this item was taken from another , seam@@ less ally &apos;s coup , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was elected Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later .

Queens@@ de Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected to the north deck of the Queens@@ de crossover network with Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is connected to Fi@@ fe now .
it is the first of four appointments of the &quot; cover fan , &quot; which approaches to the construction of each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge construction stage of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 steel ro@@ pes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017 .
the Minister for Economic Affairs Keith Brown took a visit to the site today and was one of the first to join the country on the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queens@@ de crossover network .
we are all witnesses of a engineering with a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the sealing between Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a fin@@ ick@@ y activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the pass .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck at its place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets a concrete kiss to the deck today , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge at its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first cl@@ asp is a significant milestone in every bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter is the forward @-@ looking high @-@ speed and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last road cut and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or road page .
this was reached by pulling in the northern edge of 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very fin@@ ick@@ y activity .
massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled down at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % upwards .
he@@ ats , as the toler@@ ances , which the team works , were tiny - at each side , they were only some milli@@ metres .
luck@@ ily everything went very well .
res@@ cu@@ ing in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck yet to be alive &quot;
three men have &quot; luck still alive , &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert after a crew observed the event at Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat was moving through their own power .
&quot; we saw how the boat was around in its proximity , and the worst happened to us , &quot; said the head of the rescue unit of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones .
fortunately , the strong winds have already taken the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted from 60 exhausted and on a Bo@@ je hanging without a life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coastal country boots and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said : &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have got hurt and be still alive .
the boat @-@ engine had an emergency stop , however , this trig@@ gers the boat from the person the boat from the person who was ste@@ ered by boat .
someone has wo@@ ken today about these men .
seriously wounded - man cat@@ ches her ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police ha@@ sted yesterday , the 50 year old had given the keys to the apartment to get his personal stuff .
instead , the non @-@ alcoholic perpet@@ rators cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend instead .
when they came into the apartment , he stag@@ gered twice on them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the body and the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 year old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ armed then became his sister .
together with her lifestyle , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
she could not move him , but she could leave the apartment .
that was why they went with their lives from the house .
on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life companion .
when the two women reg@@ ained the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens said : investors must be much stronger in the future .
how does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 affordable housing over the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; hand @-@ concept living &quot; for the next rat@@ ory session .
but dispute is programmed .
first about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a rule is missing so far .
S &amp; D Group president Christoph Dal@@ mann says : &quot; we are united with the Gre@@ ens : he who wants to build on urban areas will have to offer 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be created in stock .
the big deal in the town hall is , however , as viol@@ as : &quot; how do people want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal residential construction program , which will cost millions of costs and must still be financed for inc@@ enti@@ ves .
the problem , as viol@@ as : &quot; there is no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left will still use hardness regulations for investors .
regardless of what Brat@@ mann , ba@@ it , en@@ forced the situation in the housing market .
if the framework concept is implemented , it will be responsible for additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the specialists .
the program is not yet completely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one compare the loss of some 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments whose support will run out in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the plann@@ er spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the town &apos;s ongoing ties .
besides , I would have to think about to take apartments again into the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
to solve this , the problem sol@@ es .
because in the western city run at the end of the year 2010 .
approximately 1800 apartments could be found there in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : we don &apos;t want to do the owners , the residential construction companies .
since then , the number of social housing in the west city is dra@@ stically increased , it is removed from the target of the so @-@ called movement .
a concentration of social in@@ firm@@ ities in just a few quarters should not give it more .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will be even more movement in discussion .
S &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; a vast majority must the CDU out of the ship . &quot;
I have concentrated on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that cannot be found yet a compromise .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it &apos;s fascinating , how the world changes .
that teenagers and child are unable to walk outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time to star@@ ve on screens , has been compl@@ ained in the last decade of many .
on Pok@@ emon &apos;s Go , it &apos;s about to get people from the sofa and be more active .
the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games , and last on smartphones .
hence , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities outside not exclu@@ de each other .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , a app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a character set , playing cards and other Spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
how many phenomena of pop@@ culture sun@@ k interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was moved through massive demand , which over@@ load the server .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players start out with their smartphone looking for out and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who have been followed with a GPS and as soon as they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( on a screenshot of the mobile phone ) or &quot; caught . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was even younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that res@@ cu@@ ed the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 35,000 users , divided the Washington Post recently , that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - only the raw data is to increase output .
many public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns for health , people want to take a &quot; 30 minute time &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports can not be over@@ rated .
those who regularly drives sport reduces his chances to tackle cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people bring people to do something in the open , that it is fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people close their hunt , even new friends .
anyway , there are also m@@ ür@@ rical toys that always have to compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough has happened .
even if smartphone apps , like Fit@@ bit , could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does .
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
however , because of Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people to be hunting , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bal@@ es creates gold in ladies
forget the print .
forget the hy@@ pe .
Simone Bal@@ es is all the immune to all .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
whole line brilliant .
and finally the Olympics winner finally .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ in kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for a multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the apparent light of the Olympic Games .
her overall record of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ en@@ ce@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bal@@ es tur@@ qu@@ ed at the Swedish bal@@ li@@ ken during the individual battle of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman wins a multi @-@ campaign title and a total of the fifth in which it soli@@ di@@ fies their reputation , the best of its generation or even at all .
it broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey happened at that moment .
she brings this success in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought her sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years their sports art domin@@ ates , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that a mixture of amb@@ ition and precision includes that she said &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was a final exam in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the ath@@ lete , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bal@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ces , after winning the gold and silver in the individual battle of women at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday while at the farewell party , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi was retired as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although it insi@@ sted on the top , during its long road on the top , never planned the future is this really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling passport - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child , and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school tour in the gym@@ nasium , in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became power .
since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more campaign competition , a winning line that will stop so long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina has slightly led by two rot@@ ations , the picture was d@@ ashed .
Swedish bal@@ ances and ground attack - in which image stops the world title .
she returned again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swe@@ de river and put on the ground with an 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently by her end - a pure form@@ ality and tears flo@@ cked on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision that she described in her collection book , became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille went in a deep brake to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old Mann@@ er@@ amen was called by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a lead .
after her soil , she dropped to the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ es , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes doub@@ ted .
as for as it concerns , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in series mur@@ der@@ ation at the music listen in the car
according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot , who had died in one of the fatal attacks since a decade in the first serial case of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked during a trip , the authorities .
the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots from a hand@@ ful weapon while he got on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police reported that the triple murder would not have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ory thing , as the att@@ ackers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of an adult victims .
the police officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said the shooting of the investig@@ ator has led to a close look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two more wounded within four months of attacks in nine attacks .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard by K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , in the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including one brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
investig@@ ators refused to commit the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that attacks are linked and were committed by the same killer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised because of their injuries and died later .
Liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness being told by the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on shooting shooting down an empty Pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial cable .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ ed sleeves and made a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro @-@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 year old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the fe@@ west of his aging , Edmund Mikro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I create it not .
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let me pass on that .
what is not right at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her husband was informed that he never can recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they beat , institutional and institutional .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; , declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run as a remedy .
Edmund could neither sit nor cra@@ wling up to his third year , and he still cannot speak .
but it is progres@@ sing slowly .
it can run and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language , which Edmund for &quot; Please give me something before . &quot;
&quot; we bring to him drawing language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but there is no typical drawing language -- says it . Edmund has invented a number of characters alone .
micro @-@ cephal@@ y has a wide range of causes : genetic as with Edmund , and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it &apos;s too early to say how the life of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus will affect in@@ fest@@ ed .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it still does not know .
I &apos;ve never wondered after a long time , because I do not expect me to say someone really .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with child damages caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it will get better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , flood events cause life to life in Louisiana , Mississippi
severe rainfall and large @-@ scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare the emergency on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainy days .

the governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards part@@ ed that public officials will stand in contact with local authorities and have been on the way for the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesperson on the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , shared that the en@@ quiries for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were added .
Ste@@ ele said that the community had requested the community Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a ten@@ se to ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Louis@@ i@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the South of Alabama , a flood warning system was installed on Friday while it remained in the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , will achieve all odds over the weekend record level .
the met@@ ering biolog@@ ist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could swe@@ ep the houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ stream ar@@ ward ar@@ ra@@ ding in Ascen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers are slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the ticket ven@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams p@@ ens still people from the flood water in the province of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the Sou@@ thwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed by glo@@ om on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rise overnight .
he said that another brother &apos;s son who lives nearby , warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water radi@@ ated and radi@@ ated in , &quot; Hans@@ ford said .
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford , she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never seen such a blast of the river .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have any disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency relief had been res@@ cu@@ ed every three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood has spread rapidly &quot; quickly , because there were heavy ra@@ ins , and that the authorities should consider evacu@@ ation instructions .

in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a were closed nearly two dozens of blocks due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for the residents who hope to maintain the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; the last great flood , which we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems like a similar incident .
in contrast , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said that it continues to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday have been reported to have been reported , but on Friday there were no reported last Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .

Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; extingu@@ ished from balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 year old boy shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 year old child will be shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents admitted that Brown suffered several gun shots including in the lung , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in his transport to the hospital in consciousness .
&quot; he has under@@ gone a lot , his small body was extingu@@ ished by balls , &quot; he divided his grandmother Del@@ o@@ res Mel@@ ende@@ z .
I can &apos;t believe that .
the boy &apos;s condition was crit@@ ically classified as crit@@ ically and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boy told the transmitter , that it is likely to be read again .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old boy .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are loud in the stable state , according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front of a car together with 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who found himself in a critical condition , reported to the broad@@ caster .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police are currently investigating whether one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators could be .
investig@@ ators condemned C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to appear to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ ed sleeves for assault rif@@ le , which were tra@@ cked back to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , survived the crime scene .
it seems that there was a continuous fight in this situation .
on the street , on both sides of the walking distance , there were leg@@ umes .
so there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; divided police officers Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no report and the police currently exam@@ ines the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl hit by a side@@ walk in the arm when she played in front of her house in the area of West O@@ ak Lane .
and they are re@@ covering and the police are searching for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I present in the gym@@ nasium in the gym@@ nasium and for more than a reason .
first of all , I have been at every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and secondly , this crew has three trumpet , Simone Bal@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspired by many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this crew , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ lics , round off , makes every proud .
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has carved the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this is showing strength .
among the recent Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas attracted a surprising Olympic winner and rejo@@ icing .
now the world was able to witness the incredible power of the triple world champion in Simone Bal@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ stic rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual battle event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but so you do not see gym classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics has only four speakers in the team . moreover , the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi is a trainer .
but the reality looks so that tur@@ tle is a more expensive sport and gymna@@ sts in the first place in private gy@@ ms that are maintained by parents , which will come up for the training , installation , travel clothing , travel clothing , and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these are in wealthy suburbs , which can support business .
in these societies , Turner will receive its entire workout and it is for the families a dev@@ expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bal@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they began with the Tur@@ k .
we need to make the municipalities with countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a secure and easily accessible fitness training .
I have created my turn@@ out of 20 years ago .
during my events we have trained free and affordable gym@@ nasium in Harlem for more than 15,000 rural young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .

assist@@ ants want to organize further strikes after having rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by the adoption of a re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants who descended at a choice , refused him .
in July , Hun@@ t &apos;s plans were unveiled to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be ro@@ oted in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients .
the first assistance systems should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night@@ mar@@ es and weekend work to improve care and maintenance times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for assist@@ ants reported last night in a statement with : &quot; assist@@ ants demonstrated to the proposed contract , especially that it will pre@@ heat the current financial crisis and it will be used to treat all doctors just . &quot;
in only eight weeks , who still remain until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out .
efforts on the solution by the BM@@ A solution to resol@@ ving the dispute with the government to take part in the government , and sometimes to be ear@@ ning silence at risk .
this happened during a talk that Jeremy Hun@@ t made it last month , that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jeremy Hun@@ t must act now to raise awareness and worry about the assistance of assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he do not do that , so the assistance is made clear that they are ready to perform further labour measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw an increase of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 termin@@ ations , as nur@@ ses and specialist denti@@ sts were included to grant doctors on the string com@@ bat@@ ets .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes of the re@@ formed treaty associated with the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to be a better week reminder for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants that will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS , called for the assistance to end the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour measures do not reach a little but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ ses and their families are only concerned , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the past two months , we spoke to the comm@@ it@@ ee of the assist@@ ants and talked with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries to the concerns regarding the pre@@ m@@ und@@ ary and of the W@@ hist@@ an low@@ ings .
the employer hopes that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as the par@@ cel , flexibility of training , training courses , mutual recognition of the education , training courses , mutual recognition of the education , training courses , health education , health authorities and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day - medication that can lower heart attack
thousands of heart attacks are benef@@ itted from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication , after the authorities recommended to use this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for persons with a heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or further heart attack .
the N@@ HS has a four @-@ year in@@ gest@@ ion to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS has a four @-@ year in@@ gest@@ ion to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer from heart attack every year and one quarter of it suffers a heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by the collect gre@@ edi@@ an material in the arter@@ ies that are forming layers .
when the layer falls apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ gged the blood flow to the heart , thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solves , it can flow through the flow of blood and blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk of developing a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ likely .
the connection design of N@@ ICE , which has been published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health care Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack had suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively prevents heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are happy that we are able to extend battery options available to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the int@@ oler@@ ance bill should not be treatment that proce@@ eded over this period .
Culture of the Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness leaves elections in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ a Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report on corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has led to that widespread electoral fraud was wi@@ red in Muslim communities such as a devastating government report today .
the former Cab@@ inet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kles interven@@ es with the police , election ob@@ servers , and city houses to have evidence of voting rights regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Commun@@ al Government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption , said that the police should be permitted from religious moti@@ ves so that the police should be allowed to establish locked bands outside of election cabins for in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should lead an identification card to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment , elec@@ tors have to name only his name and address .
the report proposes un@@ avo@@ id@@ able ink on the finger of a person infl@@ ating it when they em@@ power their electoral voice , in order to prevent someone cho@@ oses it twice .
W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should receive greater protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this does not only serve against electoral fraud but should also protect the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial cultivation of finance , &quot; he said .
the report was arranged by Do@@ wning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets electoral sc@@ and@@ als east of London .
last year , a special court decided that the current mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man according to a Lit@@ an@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices of his amber .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had acted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in the cy@@ n@@ ical way , &quot; and that he would have put their critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man should have conducted his campaign on the basis that there is a reli@@ ant duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ tful or as a result of a re@@ im@@ itation , when one person cho@@ oses others .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence throughout the country &apos;s country .
he vo@@ iced particularly al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent paper selection - if the elderly members of the Muslim community had pres@@ sur@@ ized people to elect a candidate in their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the election system , including the col@@ oring of evidence to prove the identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on the needy members of some ethnic min@@ orities was administered , in particular women and young people , in accordance with the Will of the El@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists work with letters to stop &quot; vot@@ ees . &quot;
the report , which is being drawn up by Ther@@ esa May , requires even tou@@ g@@ her registration checks to prevent the voting directory of immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options , voters off the choice after your identification .
un@@ avo@@ id@@ able ink on the finger of a person , once they have left their voice , to prevent anyone cho@@ oses it twice .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person perform to make sure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation to an automatic envelope .
prohibition that political activists deal full @-@ elections and envel@@ opes from postal elections .
the police give away the power to set off un@@ lock stations .
the amendment requiring an indictment due to in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation pursuant to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( held by the People &apos;s Act 1983 ) .
Phot@@ ograph@@ ers in election stations .
requirement that only English in the election stations must be used ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the staff will rule out that voters will leave alone in the voting cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; ast@@ oun@@ ding &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets , no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; the electoral tribunal has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for corruption in corruption and illegal practices , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty because of a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high demands on the grounds of the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ control &quot; of the Rath@@ et@@ aker &apos;s election campaign .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the trials in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
our country carries a pride itself as the mother of the par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and le@@ ug@@ al some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .

in fact , the arch@@ ery got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave it to hear that he had already heard his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I don &apos;t see great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair@@ y , Bra@@ dy was the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post with .
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I &apos;ll take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;

the network ap@@ ologi@@ zed fast and issued a message .
we regret it right that these statements were made and that it was made possible that they are broad@@ cast@@ ed .
yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our listen@@ ers on the show and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to declare one thing , B@@ yr@@ &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not to them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and un@@ happy , chosen formulation . Byron is doing what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday morning , Mac@@ don@@ ald was dischar@@ ged in the con@@ sign@@ ment and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to support them as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment , which I made for the women floating in the C@@ BC Olympics , to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , he said .

purch@@ aser in Pri@@ mark mar@@ es over woman who tried sh@@ am@@ eless under@@ wear in the midst of the business
the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman went out of her clothing am@@ id@@ st a pri@@ mar@@ row to try the h@@ osen .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked like she looked at her , and put her back into the shelf .
they continued further and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf .
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried her under@@ wear , she fell again and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
she said , &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the retail space , she took a pair of sub@@ stit@@ ches from the delivery , attracted its own sever@@ ing and tro@@ users , and tried them .
&quot; she did not even try to find a dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each star@@ ing , when they r@@ ushed out the sub@@ stit@@ utes , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it , because they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other sub@@ missions , before finally decided that you did nothing right , and went out and out .
&quot; it seemed to distur@@ b , that she observed someone - or about the person who would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot;
Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how to think that someone would take home in@@ verteb@@ rates , who had an other person and who had not been washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , added : &quot; how I received , employees have tried to pull the pieces out of sale , after she went - what &apos;s just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of sub@@ stit@@ ching and find out that another woman had her and she retired and she had not been washed . &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday August 9 in our branch office in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all of these products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a on the weapons of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it a safer place for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to walk armed with armed prey on the distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or at the back , this video will show how you turn around your pre@@ dat@@ ors to the s@@ ke@@ wers .
when you accept from behind you , then you should rotate as an extension , so that you can see your att@@ ackers and give them out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon in front of your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with the knees in the body and rotate , while the Att@@ acker is squee@@ zed out , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backward while they al@@ ign the weapon on him .
when att@@ ackers , who are approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the cast line , grab the weapon and rotate it , so that the Att@@ acker cannot shoot .
place at the same time the weight on the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its handle , before moving back@@ wards and straigh@@ tening the weapon to him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ power .
but remember that there is a rob@@ ber@@ y on the saf@@ est to persu@@ ade your money - if you do not have a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
Ian Wright sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide of his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller drew its immune system and wor@@ d@@ ef@@ lex of a serious test - opposed to some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most rep@@ utable places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and it@@ aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk moved his course on a euro sheet , a ra@@ iling at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing pot and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system .
before the le@@ asing of every object , it used a lumin@@ ometer to show and show us what it is going to be eff@@ ected .
but the experiment , which was filmed by the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought , the rinse kno@@ b of a enco@@ res , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely imp@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and over his own health .
fortunately , nothing left that he rejected , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of its intest@@ ines by travelling the world as well as wonderful things , as well as wonderful things .
from public money to railway stations up to r@@ ushing pieces of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health is concerned and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , soil , worms and s@@ lu@@ dge . &quot;
in the film he was definitely just a fair .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ ofing material showed a L@@ umin@@ ometric number of over 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometric number is fresh @-@ washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to le@@ ak after her L@@ umin@@ ometric number was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands one of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
in the film he says : &quot; that comes to the worst thing I have ger@@ led in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I will not lick here , because here is dr@@ ink@@ able .
the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer users really new .
something that &apos;s fascinating for watching and at the same time explains the advantages of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings by the end that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led directing the film , added : &quot; let me tell me - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him , like the Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian , to lick it and others , where this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty tricks on film . &quot;
in a conducted survey carried out by the year 2015 , 84 percent of those surveyed said Mil@@ iti@@ y bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products which contain both lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social Family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ation Social Accommodation in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a non @-@ resident family left their social apartment after a del@@ u@@ ation of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized its neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of housing co@@ operative was the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls are cla@@ ved holes , wooden floors were torn , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti became for@@ ged into the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the property management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she is not afraid to repair the apartment anymore .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here . I am the opinion that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to take into account since this property is thought to be considered as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious , and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived temporarily in the apartment and the police said that the terror , who had joined the family , was a street fighting with bas@@ eball bat , in@@ timi@@ date of residents , drug abuse , drug commerce and excessive scre@@ ams , spreading and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for ant@@ iso@@ onal behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be demolished in circumstances , old garbage was found
there were used drugs in the property where in the past were used drugs .
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street , and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing meant she and her partner for@@ ci@@ bly for@@ ci@@ bly from the estate , after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to go voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours , who said that their life was made to hell .
one said : &quot; they were not ashamed . &quot;
we lived about 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times that we say the police here , are incredible .
&quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not acc@@ ust@@ omed !
now , where they are finally away , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it has been going to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was rec@@ alled in regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the crossing side of the house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were put down
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that it would be able to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a dol@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is considered .
this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour of extreme and their deeds could be terrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church who have cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have paid attention to us .
I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neighbours , and con@@ veys the message that ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior is not toler@@ ated .

with eleven successes of the record winner in Barcelona , Barcelona is the record winner .

last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic stair@@ way was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were up to the record alone , between sets and in time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches .
they were withdrawn from the grand@@ stand and left their guns at the fair competition alone .

Ma had really hard to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent .
after that certain he set the temp@@ o on the plate , leaving Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
by the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma , not the expected sequ@@ el match developed .
however , nonetheless , nonetheless breathtaking ballet change were to be seen .

Donald Tr@@ ump cle@@ ars ″ enormous problems ″ on the campaign
the U.S. Rep@@ ublic@@ ans leadership is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional conservative states , states their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now led to the weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in Utah .
a rare aspect , in which the multi @-@ track and self @-@ confident of the m@@ ultim@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns expressed by correspon@@ dents .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within their Republican @-@ Republican camp from the race , then doubt the doubts grow on his success in the battle for the White House .
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
guilt be wrong reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he accepted his well @-@ known media sch@@ ists .
republi@@ can up@@ swing
Utah is normally a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by the sur@@ vey@@ er in June , Tr@@ ump and its compet@@ itor of the Democr@@ at , Clinton , were based on Hillary Clinton .
other institutes look forward , but not with the distance , the republi@@ can candidates in the state .
as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the Senate CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question how he would stop the invasion of Clinton said : &quot; just as I had done so far . &quot;
and I &apos;m behind : this will be &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he will make nothing different to tell &quot; the truth . &quot;
if it is not enough for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is fine , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump is threatened to submit funds to support his election campaign , it should not be able to present any better circulation values .
instead of what to attack the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to Congress stronger than the arms .
Olympia : three most High Sc@@ am at D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IOC plans to set up a discipl@@ in@@ ary commission .
Ken@@ yan &apos;s athletes threat@@ ens to become the second d@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics
following a bet@@ ting attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee agreed to establish a disciplinary committee of discipl@@ ines to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian@@ man function@@ ary revealed that the former Sprinter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village was a Ur@@ in sample below the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ eller F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red I left .
this is the team@@ work Ken@@ yan in the d@@ oping control box .
the IA@@ AF World Federation adopted the IOC for information about the event to im@@ press its own investigation , shared a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following steps of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; it was named in an IA@@ AF statement .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station , and has issued itself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on red , and signed , &quot; stated Ken@@ yan Head de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I .
it was in possession of the ac@@ credit@@ ation of the ath@@ lete who stood on the list for training controls in the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was about 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , Ken@@ yan female le@@ ath@@ le@@ tics and leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been taken out of the Rio Olympics .
he should have informed about cash payments of his country about upcoming d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was alleged to have been arrested in Nairobi at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has already been under special observation since the IOC after numerous d@@ oping tips .
at the announcement of the IOC recorded more than 2000 d@@ oping target controls in front of the Rio games , it was unusual that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were put into visor .
the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency had exercised a lot of pressure on African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ Beg@@ inning was passed .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose d@@ oping control con@@ forms to the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is considered as a large runner @-@ nation .
the country &apos;s athletes won the most medals at the World Cup in Beijing in 2015 .
in a series of television reports , ARD have always been made to reports that in Kenya D@@ oping resources are easy to open and there will be significant ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ wi@@ gs .
IOC member Richard Po@@ und requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed it in the Russian ath@@ le@@ tics .
in this process , it could be proven that in this art class area has been developed and systematically agre@@ es .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic love story , like Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this , a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical captured Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ jo@@ king Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece .
the artistic director of Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical role in the classical music and fulfilled himself with the role of Mary a youth mare .
in the orchestra he dig@@ ged the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony conducted by the Venezuel@@ an Con@@ duc@@ tor Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins of music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she rec@@ alls with arro@@ gan@@ ce with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dance .
the role of Mary is always fascin@@ ated me .
first , because they are quite unusual !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she tells her in her song : &quot; I had earned Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ aturing Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it is therefore smart , of course also na@@ ive , and very passionate .
&quot; it is quite similar to me , my Italian character whom I used as Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so honour to work with her .
she is an enormous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artists and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
one sees it in every his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it &apos;s such an enormous chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; in this piece for pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot;
today we took the refugees , at that time , the Pu@@ do@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York citizens did not want them .
these are the same subjects , and today they are as ridic@@ uled as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London &apos;s ma@@ ids , which ended the IS , was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school people left for the IS last year , to join the IS , reportedly killed in Syria .
the attor@@ ney Tas@@ n@@ ime A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family had learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was presum@@ ed that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ mine of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday .
s@@ ult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after the family her family shortly after she had previously left the country and return to England .
&quot; we can only hope that the only good in it lies - as exh@@ ortation , and warning to others that are linked to the risks involved in a war zone - people ever hold this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , the s@@ ult@@ ana and two other cities from the east of London went into a plane to Turkey , and then take a bus to the Syrian border .
s@@ ult@@ anas &apos;s family has been informed that they had married a ISIS fighter in Syria - and has been a widow within a few months .

Tre@@ ats wants to blame for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazin works with photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere together to launch a 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people they want to find the next generation by Top@@ models for 2017 in 2017 .
the Chief Editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Shaw told us in the beginning of this year , that his n@@ ud@@ t@@ magazine is distingu@@ ish@@ able by classic school play@@ boys , as &quot; Play@@ boy for men is . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is convinced that calendar also does .
&quot; we have to return to the portra@@ yal of tim@@ eless and classical nude , where both women and men feel well and inspired by these pictures of a female body , &quot; Shaw said in a press release to the publication of Cal@@ endars .
women will participate in this project because it &apos;s a wonderful work of art .

Turkey : Kurdish church reck@@ ons with mass cur@@ s@@ ation
&quot; whoever does not fit and comm@@ its Erdo@@ gan is seated in packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the end of the G@@ ülen @-@ near foundation dialogue and the world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of people who fled from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , there could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the chief Apostle Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the harsh approach by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , the Kurdish church of Germany expects a mass cur@@ ses to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey , when the Erdo@@ gan regime fought against min@@ orities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the commander Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
because the government had covered up Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with pen@@ al actions before months , 500,000 Kurds would be on the move within Turkey .
following the sealed coup , sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks would add .
many will begin to re@@ start in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it can &apos;t be that a state that takes itself refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k .
the Chief of Staff gave the targeted approach to the Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ itic cities .
thus Erdo@@ gan has to increase the exit of the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been era@@ dicated or displaced already in the last hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CDU member .
the commander asked that the German government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot;
an &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic is held in Germany too .
I &apos;m not really sure in the last months for the first time in Germany .
the German branch of the G@@ ülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks would seek asylum in Germany , mainly Kurds and opposition .
the fire market as a G@@ ülen @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mia the professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan is seated in packed suit@@ cases , by the way the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the G@@ ülen @-@ nearby Foundation Dialog and education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to figures by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks already submitted the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , this amounted to 11.@@ 386 people and thereby have been entitled to almost 29 percent of all internationally recognised ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , not those who bra@@ i@@ ded against war , poverty or perspectives .
asylum seek@@ ers after the Basic Law are politically , thus from government side , individually followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; then go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
funny Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get out of the summer campaign together - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood them .
the Sunday dial will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays in 2021 , the European Parliament voted already beginning of the year .
for it is not so far : summer holidays , heat and day@@ care campaigns - that bit@@ es itself .
the locals who are convinced of the fighters , are on holiday .
most holi@@ day@@ makers that are in the country are on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not domestic , so do not choose the national day .
these are practical problems : in the holiday there are hel@@ pers , posters hang , fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers , and distribute them at the end of the vote , rub only tired .
until September 4 , 2016 , the campaign and the last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to let the people go over to the people .
the hot phase , if one can tell it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his position .
the SPD , which has been the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
the same time , as strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cut off , and what remains at the end of coalition truth remains .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous vot@@ ion campaign , one sees from his major posters .
he travels across the country , distributed ro@@ ses and ch@@ att@@ es a little with the people , as it did already his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sailors got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel to the bl@@ oss@@ oms of the African Republic .
their refugee policy , their &quot; We will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with their nick@@ name , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the right place for election campaign .
she has invited two ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to grand@@ parents , Angela Merkel is located in the Nor@@ theast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mec@@ kl@@ ands and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently published in N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s too bad to hear from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel listened .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast CDU is largely compens@@ ated with the usual voting rights on market places and at shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
this , co@@ ca@@ des , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot;
the Union also noted that , on the country , it is necessary to im@@ pose a wire to the people again .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the borders of the land there is barely present .
the advice of the CDU election fierce co@@ king to his co@@ h@@ ites is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you have to go there where people are aw@@ ful , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , golden wedding , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is standing on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD as a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys , S &amp; D Group finally reached 22 per cent behind the CDU ( 25 ) partner and just under A@@ fr@@ o ( 19 ) .
in the 2011 election , the SPD gained still clearly with 3@@ 5.6 percent ( 22 ) before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , will take the leap into the day &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtu@@ e and lay their election campaigns on the Internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; is the President Claudia Mu@@ eller .
otherwise there are green ball@@ asts of trace search for national vocal bur@@ ners among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the S@@ val@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in , curve just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ ara lakes and finds it even beautiful .
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : catering equipment among pl@@ ywood
at speed , with which the B 27 is sanc@@ tion@@ ed , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
for the persons responsible for the work , starting at 5.@@ 30 in the morning , beginning at 20 o &apos;clock , there are omni@@ present praise .
&quot; they have done a pretty bite , &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff explains from the Jet @-@ gas station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south on the weekends , until the end of October everything should be finished .
the removal of those responsible for the work is also praised , for example , if it comes to interior gates .
since the construction site moved to the south on Monday to the south , and also the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is back , the traffic situation was relaxed in the place .
now citizens can drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the escap@@ ing traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there was some significant complaints , &quot; says S &amp; D vice director responsible for the travel engineering of the refurb@@ ishment .
the residents of Bach &apos;s Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many shots were sought and rather their Nav@@ i Trust than the signs .
what makes it possible to be man@@ cher trucks in residential areas .
since the speed lim@@ it@@ ments were not adher@@ ed , the community demanded the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable le@@ aps , &quot; says King , who made himself insight into the situation himself .
there have been two to three per minute ble@@ ached .
the speed@@ ster was on the way with 77 hours per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has been moved , however , it became qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small sol@@ ace that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg are now open the road again .
business@@ men do not hesitate to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to their sales breaks , everyone who asks you to look back .
however , some more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customers &quot; is for other companies , for which the refurb@@ ishment had little consequences .
even at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum slight decrease &quot; but also provides a dream that of course &quot; the lear@@ ners &quot; is missing . &quot;
the most strongly captured are the local road along the streets .
J. Albert G@@ öhn@@ er , propriet@@ or of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
that is already threatening .
not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
they were lacking the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we will be happy to be happy about each Euro .
the sales increase in sales rose to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
road fitting have thrown his operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
he / half of his collabor@@ ators have to be released .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released , the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , Mr. Jörg Schmidt said on a request of G@@ öhn@@ er if there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant also benef@@ ited from the benefits of the location on the B 27 . now they must also have the dis@@ advantages associated with the renovation .
G@@ öhn@@ er knows from other coun@@ ties , where was so much more generous .
at all complaints , G@@ öhn@@ er is sure that his inn will continue .
after all , the family business has been located since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history .
the fact that other regul@@ ars are now less sk@@ inn@@ ed because of the complicated traffic control , he can understand .
if you cannot leave it , it &apos;s nice too nice too .
after the end of the renovation work at the end of the renovation work , G@@ öhn@@ er has no doubt .
despite the crises of BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öhn@@ er holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clients for the greatest crisis that has experienced its hospitality in its long @-@ time history .
six months of construction work is already brutal .
constantly being rob@@ bed in the name of terrorism in laws .
after the recent attacks , the Minister of the Interior of Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a thick safety package .
but what has an obligation to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
all his suggestions are politically acceptable , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security policy .
they are not asking anyone .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also agree with that .
however , as the Minister of Interior , he was on the results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the Coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach changed a little time before he presented his conclusions for the security in the Republic .
but they are the more extensive .
some things have been announced , announced , attached : that a new security authority should take care of using encrypted communication , is not new .
not the fact that Germany must implement several EU directives for passenger data and weapons legislation .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel are not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt to make suggestions with the SPD : he wants to pun@@ ish sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups under punishment and jihadists with double citizenship in the German passport .
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CDU man will dream up .
he can still keep this for reasonable and demanding anything , what does not have any odds with the coalition partner .
a few new ideas will present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they made it partially in itself : he plans fast @-@ term procedures for deportation and more possibilities to detention people before deportation .
refugees who are brought out targeted into the country are to check out their smartphones and put social media accounts for a security check .
in Dul@@ ce for denied asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about such an alleged off@@ ences or to throw their papers in order to wear their identity .
some of them is political and legal .
some is even in@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the im@@ balance of thought , for example , the question arises : what does that actually do with safety and terror ?
yes , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it isn &apos;t possible that the ass@@ ass@@ in of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people were worried about the high number of refugees concerned about security .
and things that people are working deeply , must not cl@@ asp himself in election campaign times .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
first stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the in@@ security is great .
and yes , there are campaigns .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly putting on the subject of internal security .
during the last days , there went high between the two parties .
just a gar@@ chy battle over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of double citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also ti@@ rel@@ ing here to reconc@@ ile tones .
from a conversion from the double pass he keeps nothing .
we have satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily satisfy the discussion in Germany .
they re@@ produce new things , be not sensible .
and on a Bur@@ ka prohibition , he was un@@ constitutional concern .
whether his own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners , and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it only needs to be revealed .
there is some things , which could provide for war .
however , the SPD also tries to pro@@ filing an internal security on the topic of internal security .
party chief Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes only a lot of talks and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to what it contributes to the safety . &quot;
Volkswagen gli@@ mp@@ ier is still coming through .
in spite of the diesel version , the supplier pay@@ outs are increasing worldwide .
but not in all markets it is running around .
with the response , there is a vort@@ ex for a term .
Volkswagen starts in ship@@ ments of ship@@ ments in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest motor@@ car can demonstrate a plus , despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand VW showed , particularly in Western Europe and thus charges the total sales , as announced in the Da@@ x company .
in July , the VW brand with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , according to China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , the deliveries fell by almost a sixth .
brand CEO Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , especially to two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , it has been given a purchase order in some key markets through &quot; altered economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU would explain a spokesperson .
in the U.S. , where the emission is first escal@@ ated , another min@@ us will be too be@@ ech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the most affected house brand of Lower Saxony is moving forward to gli@@ mp@@ ing through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extension minus 0.9 per cent is available to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
the head of the Group Fred Kap@@ pler was further suggest@@ ing a sales plan from January to July .
in this period , Volkswagen delivered to 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust .
in Germany alone , Volkswagen calls around 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade into workshops .
in the wake of re@@ armament , VW re@@ iter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ armament of vehicles there is fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power .
the car makers set up the customer according to the conversion of a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in the company .
reason : legal speci@@ als .
the &quot; Focus &quot; reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for rep@@ ain@@ ted diesel models .
this last Monday confirmed VW representatives in the Federal State Department .
out of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , it was confirmed that there was a meeting .
&quot; VW has the resolutions of my Commission of In@@ quiry and the KBA Complete Works . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor capacity after retro@@ fitting have no wor@@ sen@@ ing wor@@ sen@@ ing , and all of the relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was named in company .
in the long term &quot; guarantee &quot; , Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers can come back to a workshop with an engine damage to a workshop - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also , in customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is any other damage caused by failure to do nothing with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ hop@@ sc@@ andal , to have an in@@ security concerning possible warranty , as it was called .
therefore VW uses the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires rich austerity plans in the future - as the second Institute in Germany .
chief of Bank@@ notes Joseph Paul said on Thursday : &quot; only around 139 clients who park 40 million euros on gre@@ ro@@ - or daily necess@@ ities . &quot;
the German association of German banks speaks of an individual and does not see a signal : normal as@@ par@@ er would have to be afraid to pay for their savings bank . &quot;
camps bank money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 per cent penalty .
this fee requires Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund starting September from private and corporate customers for deposits above 100,000 euros on gre@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100.000 will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; Paul said .
he has covered 40 million euros , which could be raised from one day on the other , and that he could not viol@@ ate .
&quot; the bank account , which lies with me on the central bank account , account for 0.4 per cent , &quot; said the chief of the bank .
&quot; I can &apos;t put up to 4000 Euros for each million . &quot;
the cost he is continuing after the Mor@@ deca@@ hedron principle .
the bank simply could lie in the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank that would be too dangerous : &quot; I already experienced four dro@@ mes , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank account .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other assets .
only few walking to other banks .
the co@@ operative association , Bavaria stated : &quot; the extreme monetary policy of the ECB causes significant costs at all banks . &quot;
to apply alone , &quot; the operating cost is not possible permanently . &quot;
some german banks have therefore increased their fees for con@@ to@@ ying , credit cards or transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits above three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land has made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive leader of the banking stock , said : &quot; we are not expecting to pay a wide basis for deposits for deposits , in addition to banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker spoke at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; a cliff which is equipped with a little l@@ us@@ cious . &quot;
&quot; it can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; if they cover free money .
founded in 1911 , the co@@ operative bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ tach E@@ ste , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region we live well @-@ known actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of June , the President of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Frö@@ hlich had declared : &quot; the threshold , into the negatives as compared to the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it imp@@ lies migration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany won &apos;t like this in the width .
destination tiles : who actually buys record plates ?
lon@@ ely men love aged ages .
before you come to comment , in order to out@@ si@@ fy him under the p@@ seud@@ onym non @-@ Alle@@ en@@ ce@@ um short@@ ages , this statement is deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the majority of records of records are not on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the latest news of physical objects but due to the Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who have bought a plate recently , are all expected according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the 18 @-@ 24 age group is the most likely species of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des through hob@@ b@@ ys@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone at a time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I carry a modest grey suit in So@@ ho , a modest grey suit before I stand , keep my hands hold and something to decide : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a close look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s have a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly baked at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once an independent seller stayed - is there a hand@@ ful of fantastic record specialist .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various males in such stores and try to estimate their ages and mind through observations .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I have sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle ages , a woman , presumably by the 20 ) , is one day long for an meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he said .
I have about 3,000 or 4000 plates .
these record plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by email , I &apos;m not followed by him ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy as they were selling and again items that he sold when he was young and ple@@ xed .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60@@ ies , early 70s that appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought to be too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he is true that those who buy plates , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend some time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my truck .
We@@ z , 25 , who works for Sister Ray , believes that many customers who meets it meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , it has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced from the media , people who have heard about com@@ eback and let themselves to buy their old records .
of the conversations I have led , people usually have taken away so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as ph@@ onica , to recognize that the stores offer a soo@@ thing community of equ@@ ations .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med from the digital world and would like to move back to the stability of trusted records , from objects to call the happy Ju@@ ch@@ ings .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or ownership of material possessions , as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
this is with me as collectors so and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; sol@@ dered one employee in one record stack .
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people had purchased a plate over last month .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player , whom they never use while 7 % of those who buy a plate no record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while through an stack to Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ pil@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at the sounds of the Universe ( data count : three men middle ages ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy @-@ aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone came out recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table , but I would like to buy a radio record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely happening .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ ens@@ la@@ ins .
we have people who say : &quot; I didn &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
they are younger people , not older , who just clean up slowly .
opp , which has dedicated the record @-@ plates almost a whole floor , has an old audience as I am clean .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , te@@ ens and women &apos;s middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ absor@@ bing pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ink@@ ers from the speakers - is it good to see such a diversity in the customer .
none of them looks strange , but nag@@ ged psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are badly det@@ ectable if you stand next to somebody for 30 seconds .
El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes in the shop and considers the Vari@@ ables which are available for sale .
it &apos;s rather a sho@@ vel chair as a big one .
it doesn &apos;t deserve a lot , so the collecting sheets are not a real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in other way , but the beauty of plates is ... it drives with a wonderful sigh@@ ing .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I admit the registration of je@@ ans @-@ hot@@ spot , I watch a group of young te@@ ens to meet a moment for Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter think to buy a Cro@@ p record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of sheets of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees it - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to handle them .
it is pure &quot; Disk Art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the sector , and some of them could send us to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it &apos;s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as boards .
even though my research results showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they leave , at least in record shops in So@@ ho , the large number of female collectors and record lovers , which exist in reality , record shops and On@@ line@@ for@@ en .
these people probably work hard in school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety , not with the bum@@ ble through the plate stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they supp@@ oses the ga@@ ze of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old present@@ er that stretches out men &apos;s middle aged men over the shoulders .

French court ple@@ dges offer of demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected the offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live , settled down .
on a court hearing these week , authorities in Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that the state should be authorized to disman@@ tle 72 temporary shops within the bearing of goods from cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , selling hair@@ dresser &apos;s services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no tax would be paid , which val@@ bard a fire and san@@ itation risk .
humanitarian groups sharing the court that the shops and restaurants are important because the free meals , which are offered by the nation@@ ally supported association and other groups , will not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that the temporary business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who would operate 72 temporary stores , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture will be completely re@@ tra@@ ce@@ able . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role as merely people living in extremely pre@@ valent conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers have to offer .
one of the places that was threatened by the low @-@ floor was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is a non @-@ profit @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as a consultation on asylum seek@@ ers for the hundreds of vulnerable needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
over 170@@ ,000 people signed the pet@@ ition to keep the kids &apos; café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure could be &quot; for those children of a catastrophe involving the youngest eight years old . &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge of the Mig@@ rants estimated at Friday that the number of people in the jungle @-@ camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number till now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers in the course of summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be adjusted to the next generation speed measurement : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new lighten@@ ing instruments are tested , the development of speed will be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example in accidents , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or rotating bridges with a trans@@ itory route , there are often no necessary infrastructure to worry about with a stationary bladder to comply with speed limit .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , the case data will be transmitted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded through several tracks at the same time .
variable speed lim@@ it@@ ments as well as drive posts according to time , driving distance and vehicle class will also monitor .
in the high @-@ driven condition , one can move the trailer with every car with a trailer hook .
in order that it is not simply sto@@ wed , it is lowered into the measurement facility , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured frame will disappear as a safe outside cover .
furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from viol@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
even foreign authorities fl@@ ashes with the new technology : recently , France has re@@ ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain pic@@ ks silver at the 7 @-@ year Rug@@ by , after having picked up to Fiji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive British power of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ year Rug@@ by arrived in the final hur@@ dle at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated by 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odoro Stadium in Rio .
in Fiji a champion class in the handling , side st@@ eppe , desc@@ ending , line of lines and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympics in any color .
the defeat was failed by the non @-@ poor consol@@ ation prize of silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth in that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament that they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to the finals .
but independently of it would have been defeated a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form .
it might be a sol@@ ace for a GB - but it will probably not mean that at least one Br@@ ite will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s leader Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago she lost with Ryan every game at Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this strap is we@@ ary , but the progress is ast@@ oun@@ ding .
Fiji had wonderful and left the GB@@ S attacks .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . an , when one would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went out 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Col@@ in@@ is@@ au was sitting in the corner .
by another four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned into .
between 12 @-@ 0 and GB , hardly has the ball .
a terri@@ fying T@@ ackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal but it has only stopped in Fiji .
in the seventh minute of the J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a , in the right corner , a touch down , and it stood at 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still a minute play@@ time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ ten@@ dered by further weak tac@@ tics of the GB team and stor@@ med to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is like that Fiji had been born to play 7 , while GB is still going to play .
so it is also .
GB introduced basic changes to the semi @-@ season and ended the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua ran Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant play in Fiji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started a try for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had long been gone for a long time in the southern Germany , whose fans sang , Fa@@ hnen @-@ sang and dancing on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to see the bac@@ kl@@ ash approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame translated the i @-@ dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff heard that Fi@@ j@@ is h@@ ug@@ ged and GB cr@@ ushing down into the lawn .
earlier on the days in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 defe@@ ats and Britain joined South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - British change of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the boat in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on crossed the line with an impressive track work and scored a gate under the item in the second half .
Marcus Wat@@ son &apos;s brilliant programme , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ side teams , secured a win - and therefore the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by struggle with the cancer of a rowing victory
there will be no engine in more than in these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ie@@ ve , who enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the rest of the meeting , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was omni@@ present as her for the second Olympics in a row , for the first women in the history of the British Sports that put on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 3@@ 9.@@ es were un@@ en@@ camp@@ ed , which is unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ es that slide over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ inging , which does not reflect the kind of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es .
behind each gold in the rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on is far from content that make up the difference and there was no one more hel@@ ical than the coach who would not know that he would survive this day at all , when it was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had the cancer of bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do that , he spreads out everywhere .
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could be treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , what the inter@@ ruption begin to have a minimum , if that is the right concept under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I needed to go better again soon .
it was an inc@@ entive .
I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
it starts so .
rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it even greater .
in the in@@ fertility of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a lot more than otherwise , and thus trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is repeated only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and Robin worked with me .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive Thank you on him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I could have no better person for coaching or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams arrived from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not ri@@ p yourself .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something funny .
we did not want to work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race whatever we did .
the couple will take for one year before making decisions on its future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding next week , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want to say that this was my last race .
this would have too much pressure .
it took about six months in London to realize that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , exempl@@ ary for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ einer Group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavaria &quot; exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small fr@@ ying drinking water @-@ purpose compound as model for large water producer .
so it was written some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a post by the Bavarian Radio .
a little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ fran@@ ken continued its purpose .
the work of the &quot; bay@@ ern@@ al Group &quot; was widely regarded as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years old , stands for the purpose of his purpose , 28 years as managing director .
he was reti@@ re at the age of 65 years .
the drinking water sports association with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 locations and ham@@ let with around 5500 inhabitants .
member churches are the congregations of Kirch@@ ier , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the City of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for further cities and communities there are water suppliers .
the current president , Breit@@ ling Citi@@ zenship in Ger@@ tru@@ d B@@ ühl ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was ceased as a water keeper in 1985 and was appointed as the managing director of the purpose .
&quot; his duties have been very varied and they extend from water management and maintenance work , the bud@@ get@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency sales , &quot; said the chairman .
as exceptional events , she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new Foun@@ tain ( 1994 ) , renov@@ ations of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the high reservoir ( 1999 ) , re@@ inst@@ ances of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the parts of water pipes .
it has not given any stand@@ still , and I have always taken real@@ ities because water lives and drinking water the most important food .
in its eu@@ logy , they praised G@@ ö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose and he has lived in the aqu@@ atic association as it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he was able to present the success of success of the sub@@ jection group to nit@@ r@@ ung in front of the water forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken district .
I have received great recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on the hand , praised the Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together for 28 years .
he is the best water keeper and he was a loyal Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view , he distinguished the Brun@@ n@@ en@@ bau and the re@@ structure of the purpose .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the ship@@ wreck of the reservoir at Kirch@@ platz on a 3rd January .
here we had to work throughout the whole night at minus 17 degrees , so the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn should only be maintained once , because one filled the blast reser@@ vo@@ irs of the pel@@ let city .
the management of the drinking water sports was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who comes to Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna net@@ re@@ b@@ ko is open to the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago - and is turning to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 year old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Sera . &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , they believed that they had to die .
however , the eigh@@ teen @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was going well ahead and learn things privately in New York , where it is the best therapist .
&quot; to give an example : if I ask him something more than two years ago , when I sang at the Milan Scala , he rec@@ alls nothing , &quot; Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko said .
but he is the most happy man on earth .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting on li@@ fel@@ ess
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man viol@@ ated his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday from 10.@@ 45 am and was fatal .
&quot; the man called on us and stated that his partner is shot dead , &quot; said a polic@@ eman .
the perpet@@ rators may be on the run , after him would be publicly announced .
now nationwide , since Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is 1,80 m tall , muscular , bra@@ ised and has a Gl@@ at@@ ze .
meanwhile , the police has published a photo of him .
she is a couple of years old .
in the meantime , the man carries a Gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
those who Sven S. sees , will call the 110 .
the police talks about an &quot; relationship at association . &quot;
the sacrifice was born 1988 , the perpet@@ rators 1981 .
the police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing system . &quot;
&quot; we are not saying any more , &quot; said a Poli@@ ze@@ e pre@@ acher in Lübeck .
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special police unit ( SEK ) was at the crime scene .
steel - light outlook for German steel industry
the ris@@ ky and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains sp@@ ared by additional cost in millions of millions .
financial loads that threatened the industry from the green power plant are from the table .
it remains at the liberation of renewable energy re@@ formation in the inventory of the so @-@ called suit@@ ability of energy in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German General Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; I am really happy that we could finally arrive after two years of tough negotiations . &quot;
therefore , the European Commission initially planned to use steel manufacturers to use gases in the high furnace for electricity generation in their own consumption .
according to the German industry sector , the steel industry remains an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , it is now a fundamental agreement with the EU Commission to talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators be replaced in the steel works , a 20 per cent of the EEG lev@@ elling will be applied .
but this will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall sal@@ uted the agreement in Germany with the EU Commission for Own Production .
thereby , the status quo has largely written the previous provision .
a special meaning has the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; that is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
the IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt , stated on the reform of the emissions standard , too , &quot; stated IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has suffered under over@@ capacity and substantial pricing pressure .
last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy , when the world &apos;s largest producer , China , in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand , threw up steel on the global market .
European manufacturers cast Chinese steel concerts pricing .
during this spring , the situation has a little relaxed .
for one show , import tari@@ ffs on imp@@ orter has effect , to the other have accumulated economic outlook in China .
un@@ clear , how sustain@@ ably is the price repet@@ ition .
the German industry Pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp has been c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
last the prices have stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the sector respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with other cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp finally wanted to close the lock@@ ers of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , approximately 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous in spite of rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced at least six percent less raw materials than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the German economic association was announced on Friday .
after a brief increase in May , the produced amount of now returned the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the company expects the rise in the coming months due to an improved order situation .
community , Spirit , health : sing the Seniors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp is accompanied by her whole life as a young girl in his choir as a young girl , studying music in the teaching department , and now the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior member .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a sample she feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says .
by the same way she does good in her health and spirit .
for S@@ ingen is out of several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler by the German Senior League League .
most seniors welcome in choir and share the joy in music , describes h@@ ac@@ kler .
through the regular interaction , seniors can establish and maintain social contacts .
because frequently , social and family structures are frequently solved at the age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; to arrange and organise themselves , to learn to the other and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of coll@@ age . &quot;
sing can be st@@ ress@@ ful in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
because they exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
who demands his lungs a regular basis , not as fast as the pu@@ rest in the everyday life .
even when it comes to get the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German Labour Association of Senior Citi@@ zens .
in the older generations , the common S@@ ingen had a much higher place , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing of songs in older people have ar@@ ous@@ ed many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by lyrics and particularly melo@@ dies , people themselves de@@ mar@@ ched themselves to long @-@ lying events .
moreover , in the singing , a special performance is required , L@@ enz stated .
at the same time , focus on their own voice and to focus on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a very cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people , who live alone , are not only to focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition he lear@@ ns through singing in choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I have long for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with singing , there is enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent , reveals L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who sounds like a tone next to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , seniors have various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing someone from the familiar circle in a senior mood , you can easily connect .
many cities also offer vers@@ atility across the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir , can turn right into the church or the church .
many senior intelligence is also found on the Internet .
those who have no access to the Internet , can ask family , friends or neighbours to ask for help in the internet .
those who desire to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es h@@ ac@@ kler .
sing the soul well and has something to liber@@ ate - that applies to every age .
cats respon@@ ds sensitive as tom@@ cat on scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which has effect the calls of cat bab@@ ys on adult animals .
in their surprise , the males also didn &apos;t get cold - however , they stopped in the difference to the females always equal .
female cats may detect the output of cat bab@@ ys on the wing of little ones .
they react to ten percent faster on the basis of K@@ itt@@ ens , who think of great distress such as scientists from the University of Medical School and Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater now react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ wing of less and strongly encouraged young males for the males are either perc@@ ep@@ tible , or not of meaning , &quot; the biolog@@ ist Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H said .
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; magazine .
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ scre@@ am differs with the emergency needs of its aid needs .
a total of nine adult cat and eight cases were observed in the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were played for a herd of small children playing for three minutes from the litter box and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
to the other , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger natural k@@ itt@@ ens , which were lifted .
researchers keep their results despite the low sample for aus@@ sa@@ wed .
&quot; all females , even those who did not have their own offspring , did react to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned out faster to the loud@@ speaker , when this calls played the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be an@@ born or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby noise .
even though , some studies showed that women re@@ acted sensitive on infants , no matter whether they were mothers or not , the biolog@@ ist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks on &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ph@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey in the former foot@@ star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ph@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey takes place an important football match again .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ fo Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul in Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
even during the suspension of exceptional cases after the overthrow in July , the government , everyday life of normal vou@@ chers should not be affected .
this does not apply to those suspected of being suspected of the movement of pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen who is responsible for the put@@ sch attempt .
even before the football is not done .
an arrest warrant issued against the former starters Hak@@ an Sü@@ ph@@ r issued an arrest warrant .
the United States , however , is being accused of being a member of a terrorist group in America in the United States .
Sü@@ ph@@ ane is supposed to be a member of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen who is responsible from President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan to the attempt of the coup .
true , the state of emergency for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact the result of the most Turks would have as good as no effects .
the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy @-@ weighing &quot; on public places in the country has concluded Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday .
the Sports is - as the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
traditionally fans of the workers &quot; clubs don &apos;t count to the friends of the President .
however , what the Turks do so face dramatic experiences in history is the strict re@@ jection of military put@@ t .
fans even agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
with the winner of Pok@@ al@@ sieg@@ er Gala , he will be again arriving to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
Cologne presented its sporty value in the past season with proof : with 17 gates and nine templates , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ im@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory point .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in place . &quot;
he has completed the season at an excellent way and secured the cup in his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record champion was a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
after the round @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; say in the Europe League early .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it only brought to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we made it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year was better .
in particular , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season of season as the South @-@ Li@@ g Tor@@ to@@ z@@ ö@@ pf@@ enn@@ ig@@ s put the base on the 14th Title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
following an agreement that had been under the contract in the AC of Florence , the Gom@@ ez did not only register after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after its European holiday .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; he cited the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ head F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
however , the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to give rise to around a third of his € 7.5 million year of sal@@ aries , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; his salary at Florence we cannot pay . &quot;
despite d@@ oping : this ath@@ lete still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ ws in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa is not allowed to start in Rio .
other ath@@ le@@ tics Championships can only laugh about - they fight in Rio around medals .
the topic of d@@ oping is determined , as before the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics Games .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers after a d@@ oping lock in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had a d@@ oping lock in just before the games , was dug off and spread out at their start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
there was a whi@@ st@@ ling scene : with a broken smile , she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when they understood that they won &apos;t take gold , the audience broke into a rush .
but there are still many other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the Rio Olympics in spite of the d@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ slot / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in the Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships .
he had been locked two times for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his career , the 2004 Olympic champion from 2004 and Ex @-@ Champion is even faster than before , it &apos;s over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to be sitting in 2010 after taking the in@@ gest@@ ion of pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had a strong tooth after surgery , defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European Championship in 2010 was tested by a positive effect on the prohibited vote of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ a@@ amin .
Per@@ kovic fought the in@@ gest@@ ion and was imprisoned for six months .
the four most advanced lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ it@@ in .
La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two times world champion over 400 m , was tested positive and has been locked up for 21 months in 2010 .
a means to increase penis enlargement is responsible , stressed Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 year old is the world &apos;s fastest male in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete have been recognized as many medals .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years after having found testosterone d@@ oping .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave the Olympic Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid d@@ op@@ ings and the EM title in 2006 because of testosterone .
he also recognized the 2008 Olympic Games for the 2008 Olympic Games , due to an appeal by the International Sport@@ Court of Justice , CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked two of the world ranking list .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ it@@ in was first tested in May , but may still be launched in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year old world champion , notes on the in@@ gest@@ ion of a banned dietary supplements were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran out on July 13 .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al deaths

whether further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the Southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon also are Austrian citizens , is still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will stand in constant contact with local authorities , such as liqu@@ e@@ ers .

in the det@@ onation of the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police officers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal worker .
according to the authorities in a flower bed , the explo@@ sives in front of the re@@ four of the coastal police have gone into the air .
finally det@@ on@@ ations of Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the Southeast Coast several injured .
you go from a link to the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , whose name was .
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same manuscript , &quot; said Chief Editor of Dan@@ ai Crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday , journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express itself to any moti@@ ves - but do probably take action against the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , however , stated that the attacks were not related to Islam@@ ist insur@@ rection or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited by limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok .
rather , it is thought that the bombs of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities have received secret signs for forth@@ coming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact date and the locations .
yet , un@@ clear what group behind the attacks sho@@ ve .
the police pointed out their officers all over the country to strengthen the security relating to major government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and leisure facilities .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not judge towards tourists .
Hua H@@ in is a palace designed by the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to reason of any bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to provide the instructions of Thai security authorities as a result .
high safety risk ( safety level 3 ) paid for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ches and its en@@ vir@@ ons .
after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations there will not be ignored earlier in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday revealed a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta .
this grants the military big influence in the years ahead .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs have been an attempt to sti@@ pen@@ se chaos while the country was moving towards stability , an improvement of economic conditions and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody ri@@ ots , with@@ holds himself to have the kingdom of stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip for years in the extreme south of the country of mus@@ li@@ mic insur@@ rection .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
one year ago , in Bangkok with a stop on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine 20 people , most of them were foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack on the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is given to the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional protection .
after several offices , the Constitutional Prot@@ ectors also submitted a group under observation .
&quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; Application Con@@ ditions for Or@@ tions against the Freedom Party of Democratic principles , &quot; The President Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
thus assur@@ ances of other Islamic faith , or from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist fashion .
so we observe the movement now .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and &quot; loss of your own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
Constitutional Prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - watch the &quot; Ident@@ ities &quot; already .
as a result , Ma@@ ate said his authority is closely matched to state offices .
&apos;@@ groups like the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court .
generally speaking extre@@ mi@@ sts , to address them with adol@@ escent language , often with pure music .
the friendly Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not praying for its own cause .
the propaganda will appeal the people emotional .
young people are due to sus@@ cep@@ tible in this special way .
this is dangerous .
finally , there were reports from several federal states reports on the contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ ity @-@ politicians . &quot;
he said , I have no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , the possible contacts of this species are only relevant in a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people , the extrem@@ ist , changes their destination and so extreme .
the decisive factor is , whether such people have their control to the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view to the significant increase of rectangular crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , he said that he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but in recent years we have found that it can give rectangular structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may be possible that other rectangular group@@ ings or small groups form that there are attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other judicial moti@@ ves .
a clear @-@ wide or pan @-@ wide control of sp@@ ster@@ ror@@ ism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were developed on the regional level , or in social networks .
so , Ma@@ ate said that many attacks on the account of people went that before they did not appear in the right scene before .
that is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ icious attacks on asylum subjects were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed perpet@@ rates , who had nothing to say with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different or voted for example , CDU , SPD or left , however , which are radic@@ alised by righ@@ tful vocal m@@ oods . &quot;

not always determine the Olymp@@ ion@@ ics or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ age@@ ous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the Rio de Janeiro summer concert .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the lightly coated s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow to see time no longer in the TV pictures .
he just disappeared - no matter how far the neck@@ line was selected .
in the social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transferred to the vir@@ al Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a return of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 starters .
it was , however , rather its exact sporty figure that attracted the attention of international media attention .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old does not take part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international pool association .
this is distributed to make swimming in inferior countries .
as in Equ@@ op@@ ia the most athletes walk , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is everything : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the great race .
quickly the first nick@@ name made the turn .
some media recorded it as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
based on a well @-@ being &quot; Well @-@ being &quot; the English tab@@ loid The Sun &quot; made it fun with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; over him .
his time , he hit the 100 meters of open style with a minute and almost five seconds .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i worked for media attention .
unforgettable , the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea @-@ Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle alone .
fr@@ en@@ etic was fired at the time Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old had to swim only eight months before Olympia , and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

the back@@ wards came suddenly - but not surprisingly surprising .
the difficult situation in the market research company Gf@@ K announced that the chair by CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be more uncertain , the longer lasting from him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nür@@ n@@ berger Market Research Centre Gf@@ K : after another dis@@ appo@@ inting business numbers and the resignation of business management , the global number Five of the industry is in front of a person@@ alised new beginning .

details I didn &apos;t want to call a business spokes@@ man on Friday .
who will play the market research business in future , is currently un@@ clear .
on Friday , it was on Friday , at the end of the shareholders , the dis@@ appointment of the continued success was great years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K leader since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of restructuring have not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; said it .
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business , every participant owner will be un@@ quiet sometime .
&quot; if this would be the case at BMW , that would make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; said it .
after the preceding quarter , the Company also had to stop the loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales amounted to 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable period of the previous year .
in the first half @-@ year , sales decreased by 3.4 percent to Euro 3.4 million .

accidents - bus sli@@ pped into cr@@ ush in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
when an accident involving 43 senior citizens were injured as a passenger passengers on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) , eight people were injured .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered serious injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to devi@@ ate to her data to the opposite truck that drove them to the opposite road .
the bus arrived right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spokesperson for the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus no self @-@ constantly , &quot; she said .
the brig@@ ade freed the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency medical help arrived at the outskirts of the regional road 2 .
the most un@@ skilled trav@@ ellers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ble district of Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there they should wait for a spare bus in the travel company .
the investig@@ ators requested the load @-@ driver and possible witnesses to report on the police .
the fees per cubic meters are from 1 October 2016 for the fields of se@@ wer@@ age Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World seeds 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the latest in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will then be increased again , if appropriate improvement .
according to an excessive calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf is at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ berg ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found in the approval of the budget by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Kul@@ mb@@ ach which was discovered for these se@@ wage systems .
due to its legal knowledge , the market Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as the commercial and industrial factories from Wel@@ sch@@ an@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg have had to gr@@ asp deeper into the pur@@ se .
the emergency increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as the Board of Directors was presented to the panel , Herbert Schmidt was the re @-@ processing of the fees for the se@@ wage systems of the market community .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , overseas positions and sub@@ discoveries from the previous calculations should be compens@@ ated .
based on all three se@@ wage systems , the result is that there are relatively small se@@ wage systems with very small se@@ wage treatment , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
because of the low distribution base , expenses for the necessary repairs have to be gra@@ ce@@ fully developed for several thousand Euros .
moreover , water san@@ itation is slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants .
furthermore , the cal@@ am@@ ity period in all three facilities do not last due to the age of san@@ itation and repair applications in a significant extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the equipment for world cup , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp . almost 20 years .
Schmidt cited that in the wast@@ e@@ water plant Az@@ endorf understood the mechanical venti@@ l@@ ating system due to damage to damage .
in the p@@ umping track , the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old con@@ veying capacity had to be over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed and during the pond industry L@@ opp had to be replaced after almost 20 years of operation of the first tender grass to be fitted and additional ventilation will be installed in order to be able to comply with the legislation of water regulations .
Schmidt : &quot; regarding these exceptional expenses , the continued support and maintenance costs , which are to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which was significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made clear that at low water san@@ itation in the three facilities the expenses for the operation and maintenance will be achieved . &quot;
moreover , Schmidt would have added that the market community of large entertainment costs in the se@@ wage systems have sp@@ ared over the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants will continue to remain pre@@ f@@ ited according to view from the stone houses on the duration of Fri@@ es@@ en@@ b@@ acht@@ al , because it is not possible to extend the supply @-@ supply of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ b@@ acht@@ al san@@ itation by these systems because it is de@@ fic@@ ated facilities .

Snap@@ chat : anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asian cartoon critic@@ ises
Snap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel opposite breeds .
with its filtration tool , Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that borders the absurd .
you can turn yourself into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a piece which could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are bl@@ oss@@ oms , autonomous tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ appearances are going to the public .
Snap@@ chat @-@ filters have caught in the past , in which they were accused that the app Black@@ face wore or white skin would be prop@@ elled as beauty ideal .
when these week made some users a filter for some users who gave them sl@@ ugs , false teeth and da@@ un@@ ene che@@ eks , there was a few critics a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ lowing . &quot;
they asked whether this repeated contro@@ versy has been referred to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the messages and indig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat thought it would have been disabled .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was a homage to An@@ ime &apos;s characters and not as a cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us , the filter remin@@ ded of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és .
others decided to draw the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student , written over the photos wide that the filter was &quot; viol@@ ating and mil@@ dly said . &quot;
they added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter @-@ setting of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yel@@ lowing of j@@ aun@@ t has been pulled to the extreme extre@@ m .
snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diet and integration of integration , from conference facilities up to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience young people - who are in the breed different than their older b@@ ill@@ ers - could be rather likely to expect sen@@ sibility .
when one created by Snap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tering a picture is created , &quot; so much more difficult , that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided that the designer and engineer was working for medium to er@@ ase their Snap@@ chat account , others required to do the same .
in an interview with media and in a telephone interview she said that she contradic@@ ts that breeding @-@ related contro@@ versy sur@@ faced a lack of imper@@ me@@ ability at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the great part of white , only male leadership and ended their essay with h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ racce Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so the Chinese I @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions , in which they are safe or feel comfortable to say what to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the Company doesn &apos;t publish figures to the diversity of its workforce , and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his collabor@@ ators , but according to a microphone , the company has recently set a personnel responsibility , which focuses on sub@@ ordin@@ ate population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said that she will be closed their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military service for@@ ged ISIS secret service information , re@@ stores the Congress
members of the United States Central Command set up re@@ loc@@ alised information to draw a more optimi@@ stic picture of war against the so @-@ called Islamic State of Iraq and in Syria as it would have allowed actual conditions on site in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the Republican Committee , the Secret Services Committee and the Military Com@@ or@@ ites , reported of great dis@@ satisfaction at Central Command &apos;s intelligence analy@@ st , reported that the su@@ peri@@ ority led to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news service information published by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders typically found a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism when the actual states were allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; written a newspaper article published .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses of our political leaders will be presented , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republican member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
Cent@@ Com leadership mistake up to the top of the organization &apos;s top tip .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct evidence that government peaks on Obama would have given reports to change reports how analysts predic@@ t from their pre @-@ laws , a more optimi@@ stic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements , and statements made more positive before the congress , &quot; reported the report . &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com members publicly announced that a military surrender had already begun in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second biggest city of Iraq , remains under control of Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , is as much clear . &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republican Congress of Congress from Kansas , in a opinion statement .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the top of Central Command has changed the par@@ ative international reports to reduce the risk by ISIS in Iraq .
the rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the task force to life after being all@@ u@@ ded that analysts concerned the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during investigations .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports were under way by the General Inspec@@ torate of the Ministry of Defence .
Democratic Members of Intelligence Agency published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , &quot; the High St@@ aten Democrats in the Kom@@ som@@ ee , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , announced in a statement .
this process , such as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the release of insi@@ di@@ fied services , &quot; the mor@@ ality ab@@ stain@@ ed under analysts and &quot; was excessive enough space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats announced not to have some clu@@ es on the intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts in respect of a &quot; particular political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the congress of the Congress was published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times informed investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s Chief Inspec@@ torate that came to the findings of Cent@@ Com .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a lawyer of the Pentagon , issued in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on congress during investigations of the General Agency &apos;s Office .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the Intelligence and the Ministry of Defence welcomes the controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that has now been made by the growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year have seen the question in which President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest responses of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information concerning the Islamic State remin@@ ded over the conflict of more than ten years ago , as an Cent@@ Com analy@@ st written contrary to the recommendations of many analysts at the Recommend@@ ations of many analysts , and a little time on it to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in revolt against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team led Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to statement of government states that no significant impact on the government &apos;s government received no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since these pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical refin@@ eries were used to sell oil on the Black@@ market .
but that knowledge was not published , however , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam leaders , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature due to its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Dr. Joseph L. V@@ otel at Central Command .
the United States wins quad@@ rup@@ ted match in the field of women , a show@@ down with great Britain .
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victories on Japan , K@@ atie was also the first two gates of the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember it ever done .
&quot; I have no idea , &quot; she said .
I am not owned by the people who keep their goals in the memory .
however , she knows : the Americans are 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and they are in their group with the British on the first place that remains unbe@@ aten in Japan after their 2 @-@ 0 victory .
Britain and the United States will hit each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams will find the first and second place within their group .
the first placed will be the strong Dutch somewhat longer out of the path , which guide the other group .
whatever the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising vort@@ ex through their success story , four years after the last London Games landed on the last of 12 places .
B@@ am was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as they did not qualify for the ca@@ des .
then came the year 2012 , where she and her team went wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and with that they would turn things better .
a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the working time in London , which we now have .
we can w@@ anna catch the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the Middle East .
India had gone without win in the tournament , but the team showed herself surprisingly tough and held the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
it carried a spr@@ inting with a flat ball over the left fl@@ ank , then moved into the middle and drew the ball into the gate to pro@@ cure the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the center of the last quarter .
the sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
am@@ id@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , as late it is , there are the Olympic Games .
the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events will feel constant and inev@@ itable to a running relay between competition and pursu@@ es .
it is , as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which will protect the runner for a s@@ wimm@@ ers from the wrist@@ watch to the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t stop the TV , reading a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the waiting line in Coff@@ es@@ hop , without hearing Simone Bal@@ aam , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there &apos;s Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ ling of women with dimples , would certainly have been sent under these known names , which would be sent to Prime Time , when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even fish .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame is not lit every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade there are sports that are not widely accepted : air@@ brush , arch@@ ery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and may rule it long .
but if I would like to make a modest arguments to my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had made his debut in Sydney , the last 16 years has perceived that many people had questioned , didn &apos;t know it is a Olympics &apos; .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in the jumping jumping competition and made a athletes until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese , and the Canadi@@ ans to share the women .
Dong Dong von China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on a certain side of side@@ walks , partially because it sounds for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as those for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but I &apos;m just a bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ ously potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ or of his never @-@ to @-@ end coll@@ ision - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gy@@ ms and diving , the two sports that essentially uni@@ fies it .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means something like &quot; jump board . &quot;
race winner jumps on a huge trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , H@@ real and Sal@@ tos ) before landing at the feet .
they are rated at the official Olympia program according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
twenty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the target , sometimes back and down , up and down on the playground .
they don &apos;t just ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also in the TV broadcast another major goal : that of the world or Olympic records .
the targeted stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator .
but it is also what I feel more da@@ zz@@ l@@ ingly while watching these games .
this trampoline offers a breathing sp@@ ell .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is up .
a moving movement is not the goal .
he or she prepar@@ es , seem@@ ingly heavy lifting as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upward , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ less to the top .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty but during exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves within the distance , just the dre@@ aming , elegant raising of time and gravity .
it is as Zen like the competition could only be in the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final customers of the women will be staged on Friday afternoon , in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , likewise at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will run the final , as part of a afternoon block at both days of 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that will probably over@@ look at the general tum@@ ult .
if the levels of consciousness is only achieved by the Ang@@ ers and the objec@@ tivity of male athletes - as the male US Turner came to the The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his following air rin@@ ks , new fan base .
&quot; a generation of protest@@ ers &quot; in Ethiopia , Long one cub@@ ator of the United States
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia , strug@@ gling upon violent resistance of the government .
witnesses testified that protests were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia just to break with us ?
in the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of western Africa with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sho@@ ok the country , and more territories were growing .
last week thousands of people broke on streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s answer was un@@ merciful , according to human rights organisations .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen cru@@ el@@ ly shot and killed protest@@ ers .
in circulation , videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or early this year , show how security personnel are h@@ itting young people with bum@@ ps while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now asking a temporary investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to maintain this country and it will even become more difficult , &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of International Crisis Group , is a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services collabor@@ ates closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa if at all , get much western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new drive train in Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba capital .
roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dis@@ sidents were put into silence .
many were put into exile , or into prison , killed or driven into the se@@ back of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and these do not have other options except protest@@ ing , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ y@@ st T@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground @-@ use to lit@@ ters in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
following a widespread election last year , the gover@@ ning party and allies gained the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliamentary elections .
at the same time , tension along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for this cr@@ un@@ chy , controversial line required hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden were forced to profit more or less forced to use turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again in recent years .
several factors explain why feelings of pro@@ vocation , after years of short@@ age , explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smart phones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate via social media because cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved Internet services .
even if the government closed access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are located .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were gathered as protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since then , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from branches of countries , mainly Christian floods , in politics and the economy , while they are exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ lands .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are going to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the biggest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia are dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and the military , dominant in the intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , served until his death in an un@@ sealed disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think of corners .
analysts say that he was especially toler@@ ated to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special commis@@ sions to edit opponents and to make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; the current regime is missing on this foundation , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st .
Ethiop@@ ians &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who arrived from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had an u@@ pro@@ ar , in 2005 , after thousands of elections were protest@@ ing against the elections which were apparently stolen by the government and then stolen from the government .
during the following Raz@@ ces , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if it were less than in recent months and that time of un@@ rest fell relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new pop@@ s , as well as for its measur@@ able progress in poverty ab@@ normal@@ ities .
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ g@@ ment of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , protest@@ ers in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , surrounded by Tig@@ ray , and hatred for the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in the social media .
analysts say that protests in the US and other western allies bring into an autonomous position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though they recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West is definitely trying to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to combine his ally in a vol@@ atile area .
&quot; this , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , &quot; is a very thin free migration . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains that Obama &apos;s claim has been a &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy surrounding the last contro@@ versy surrounding his campaign by repe@@ ating his multiple asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the Islamic State which was not seriously meant .
the clari@@ fication of the questions addressed to the communication skills of the Republican candidate , whether he is able to communicate clear and understand@@ able with the American public .
there is also his fel@@ low@@ soldier , who stri@@ ve to take action during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain to the original position that he couldn &apos;t have meant .
after entering a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump appe@@ aled to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to point out President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he is just being sar@@ cast@@ ic .
the contrast was contrary to the previous day where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he meant the ap@@ ology completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t wanted to save the statement on something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate really wanted to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism is down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to focus on the focus of his campaign due to random p@@ ad@@ ings to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held talking about business situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this issue .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their talk boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already appe@@ aled Sar@@ kas@@ mus to his defense .
at the end of July he attracted strong criticism as he said that the Russians should cr@@ ush Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he declared &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ cast@@ ic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then go back to ru@@ in .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test like certain messages sent from his fans as they arrive , and then appropriate &quot; clear@@ er &quot; according to what the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , an communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he is cle@@ ver@@ ly enough to keep his declar@@ ations , so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ ending the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an advanced sound , since its envel@@ opes was further declined .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a large lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is in general trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently accused his critics , to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand its humor .
but while he stands in focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze mit@@ ts his loyal co @-@ h@@ aul into the un@@ comfortable situation , ir@@ respective of how pro@@ voc@@ ant may also be his testimony .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps prominent inter@@ ce@@ ers , has great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that before Obama , ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ bit@@ ters , absolutely false , and so it was because he ab@@ orted the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ instream Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government led by Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an foreign minister when ISIS allowed to spread the situation in the Middle East is aggressive under control .
before the election event in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump put off his attacks on the media and threw them out on each of his words , and to be taken over against him .
he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , fear@@ ful &quot; television professionals who try to understand and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ un about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use as a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential election .
once pushed over the market from the market , café in Green@@ point return
Ver@@ b Cafe was a horri@@ ble café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay for cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed by the prices from Bed@@ ford Avenue .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s business , invented in Summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local authorities depri@@ ved it as the last loss in a genetically modified town .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is altern@@ ation , but I still cannot believe that C@@ ensus is dead , the Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is re@@ inv@@ entive .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide funds for a new regional office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept many things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
there even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment with them .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and saut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are nat@@ al dishes .
the café is not served more beer , but fresh juices are available .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he not@@ ices a st@@ aked stream of old tri@@ bal customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed by prices of William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after she had moved to Green@@ point she would take the way out .
after the Ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee ten@@ ham , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if they presented at this day instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea , who is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the start of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there to work and ordered in@@ so@@ lic@@ ally to the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss clock watch and they prepare my Everything @-@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and take new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal can still get his usual order nowadays , but sometimes it changes its re@@ ins with bacon , eggs , and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not gro@@ pe about that the soap store has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee shops as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go down to their offer , &quot; Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu in Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he pre@@ aches to stop them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill in the cold bre@@ wed coffee into bottles and sell .
there is also a chance that the café is expanded to an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new fi@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed by the ground , when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt told that the location of the Lok@@ as and the purch@@ aser felt a new coffee as a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as foo@@ dies , President Roosevelt had a Fa@@ i@@ ble for refined del@@ ik@@ es at Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland sea tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was somewhat modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man said .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights , and are both food histori@@ ans .
co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was the Chinese cuisine in the United States during the bri@@ ck@@ yard in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about living in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the Food Per@@ spective .
her newest co @-@ operation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the iron berg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ au@@ cr@@ ate snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a cream energi@@ zer with Oli@@ v@@ ault , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable salad .
when deb@@ ating Hack@@ sau@@ te , this couple found the couple for a discussion on the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man .
there were pean@@ ut bread , meat lo@@ af and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many peanuts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E sm@@ iled .
&quot; he must have laid down in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said .
during the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male rock workers and served fresh baked past@@ ures for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who was sent to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; draws the ways to which the country went out to be not the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans was a central , ang@@ ed question , &quot; committed co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
in the same way , the new bud@@ get@@ ed food : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and casserole , were added to basic nutritional supplements , the casserole once more , &quot; realized , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delic@@ ac@@ ies could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ epy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
the flesh , which had been the centre of the American kitchen for years , became a rarely ser@@ rated luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar compounds were tried out , since a cal@@ orie rich and nut@@ riti@@ ous satisfaction was prec@@ e@@ dence to taste or even healthy kitchen .
while searching for the book , which included recipes , there was a court of this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter .

he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died at a facade attack of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a Civil Protection Group , which according to the image newspaper had so far saved nearly 60,000 people .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers take their own life to play for people from the bom@@ bed houses and to achieve the first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the vision of the group : a video of the civil servant that shows him for an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant in the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the bright symbols in the grave of war .

Greenland : the el@@ dest of the spine is nearly 400 years old
rarely sight .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks usually come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and is floating with a 1 km / h in the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland ha@@ ie won only 150 years of age .
same floating swi@@ ms of Greenland on the ground of the North Atlantic coast , in an hour it reaches just 1.@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes to it , the five meters long Tier acceler@@ ates to a wh@@ opping 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
but this characterized by lon@@ el@@ iness , however , seems to be a patent remedy for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the journal &quot; Science &quot; anyway by a Greenland who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commenting on Alexander the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , Alexander &apos;s lif@@ esp@@ an , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the Evol@@ ution@@ s@@ bi@@ ologist assumed that Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks become rock @-@ old .
only the evidence is missing .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually occur at the surface usually only in winter .
researchers know a little about the lifestyle of Greenland shar@@ ks .
her tim@@ ber@@ pent@@ emp@@ o seem to be more than six animals off the top of the val@@ bard , with a transmitter .
prey make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swallowed the ja@@ w kno@@ b of a young polar bears .
possibly , they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rou@@ ters on the basis of the ice cream and look at Ka@@ da@@ ver , which tor@@ ates from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland shar@@ ks , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was only 81 centi@@ meters long , while the biggest 502 centi@@ meter was measured .
to obtain the age of animals , analyze it with the Carbon @-@ 14 method to relie@@ ve the shar@@ ks of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eye lens develops already before the birth of shar@@ ks , which contained proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens center .
their birth should therefore be in the early 1960s , when atomic bombs attempts to beat larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third tier with 220 centi@@ meters in the third , the lenti@@ ls contained a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 out of the atomic fact that it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all the larger Greenland shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens centre , which caused by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ metre @-@ long Greenland was a age of 335 years while the record @-@ shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 inches old even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females will only get offspring when they are over four meters , it was known .
now , the researchers have been able to as@@ sign an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters probably stood at the threshold of sexually mature and his old age was determined with 156 years , Greenland shar@@ ks with the prolifer@@ ation of at least one and a half centuries .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters , is no coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland @-@ w@@ al , put on neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught up in Alaska .
through low temperatures often the organism of the living animals live on as@@ par@@ s .
so they attack later - and slow down .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often especially big .
because the volume is much faster than its surface , in@@ ating by the animal heat .
the thermal loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on it , as far as possible as many descendants &quot; as possible , &quot; says the evol@@ ution@@ ary @-@ biolog@@ ist Sch@@ advent@@ lein .
an extremely large animal should rather invest its resources in a long life .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the City of Frankfurt &apos;s competition has its best opportunities in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg as the best opportunities to mig@@ rate from London to create jobs and companies .
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt has benef@@ ited most of the Bre@@ xit &apos;s vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ins , Director of the Compet@@ ence Bank &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether financial stores can continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval in the UK has so far enough .
they just use big US banks .
multiple banks have already announced that jobs are held .
the lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; anticip@@ ates a 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is united with responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other major authorities such as the European insurance cover E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Council ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector as the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the monetary bank is important to banks as they can communicate directly with the super@@ vis@@ ing , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ane .
in Luxembourg , a large fund branch , as well as Dublin , will be worse in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt am clearly easier to reach the big airport .
further , the city with slightly available commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ane .
at the Seine , the r@@ ents for top @-@ class industrial real estate will be 50 percent higher than the main one .
in addition , Frankfurt has a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of corporate consulting Mer@@ cer , the city is set to place seven , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
even if the quality of life has a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European domestic market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; he ref@@ uses I@@ W .
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ xit &apos;s vote .
in addition , the power relations : in London , according to the figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , in the end of 2015 , about 14@@ 4,000 people were working in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead gets legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US National Congress decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the re@@ funds of legal costs which are created with the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was liberated from a loss of damages amounting to $ 200 million for infr@@ in@@ gement of two patents from Mer@@ ck , in connection with block@@ bu@@ ster medications So@@ val@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge issued a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ sever@@ ity and other inhumane acts .
in the case of lam@@ entation of the lam@@ entation on Thursday , US National Park in Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to charge of the costs incur@@ red during the defense of the fjord .
Mer@@ ck tries to settle in Gilead , which govern@@ s the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained each other , def@@ endants and property rights in which So@@ fos@@ bu@@ vi@@ r are rounded off , active ingredients in the medicines of Gilead .

Clin@@ ics deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % Federal Government
Hillary Clinton released their tax statement on Friday in 2015 , which resulted in the Democrats and a revenue of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for charity , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former Minister Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aries ; former Secretary of State issued a revenue of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about their office in the State Department .
Clin@@ t &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ins came from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his tax declar@@ ations of the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; was announced by the Washington Kamp@@ a hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ er@@ i in an opinion .
in a cr@@ ab@@ by contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false instruc@@ tors and re@@ tra@@ ders to publish his promises in relation to its previous promises .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged by the law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a control examination due to tax authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s electoral campaign in Ian &apos;s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidate .
on Thursday , Michael Co@@ hen , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor , said to CNN that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax checks are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned that his ref@@ us@@ al questions arise regarding assets , his funds for charity organizations , his business practices and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton had already over@@ thrown an issue on the theme and published a video on the Internet in the high ranking of rep@@ ublic@@ ans Tr@@ ump heads to release its tax declar@@ ations .
on Thursday they spoke the topic during a speech on the Michigan economy .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; she said too much .
Polit@@ ico has reported that , during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump has not paid more or less tax , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of account@@ ants and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case .
representatives have become a subject of electoral struggle .
Clinton supports a regulation which is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett which would make sure people pay more than USD 1 million ear@@ ning a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election event for Hillary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka requested buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump at a meeting to exchange their tax declar@@ ations .
buff@@ ets said he had been subjected to a tax examination of the IRS and have been subject to a tax statement &quot; Fear &quot; before the voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clin@@ ique &apos;s campaign has released tax declar@@ ations as far as 2007 .
the Clin@@ ics , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax statement of the 2015 Clin@@ t showed that these only USD 100 of their income would be considered a salary , unlike most of the Americans .
their main money invest was a cost @-@ effective inner fund , consisting of which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9,000 .

Prot@@ ectors in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ xe way to keep elephant in people living in human settlements - they throw the con@@ doms of them that are filled with chili powder .
the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already been the idea ahead years ago by training with the U.S. Nature Conservation , trained by volunteers in the North Tanz@@ anian , to use a non@@ violent four @-@ layer method to protect their homes and harvest without infr@@ inging animals .
before , many speakers have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the applicant &apos;s day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit we have developed within this municipalities we could observe a change of their attitude , whereby they can prevent the elephant from their fields without damage the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the illumin@@ ants of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bubbles in a horn .
when he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown out .
the chi@@ powder bl@@ ending with Earth will be packed with a fire@@ work cor@@ per in a con@@ dom , whose end is tied to the ignition switch .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom begins with a pop up and spray fine dust to ch@@ illi in the air .
a hint is usually already out to hunt the elephant .

Jewish director breaks the Berlin hotel , because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; request - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ folding a media bu@@ ck , after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ fix , as the Arab guests could have requested an &quot; staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust promot@@ er &quot; Shoah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the pre@@ lu@@ dge list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to select Israel via an e @-@ call center .
looking for a statement , the director turned to the hotel concept .
the answer he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel said that the measure has a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason that stood behind it , dis@@ b@@ ted more anger in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix will be deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was cited .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; says the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
that is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has collected in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a bigger dis@@ grace .
no explanation .
we expect the hotel &quot; the right conclusion , &quot; said the ministers .
the incident dissolved a fairly large reson@@ ance on the Internet , with which the people called a sc@@ andal .
some sub@@ mitting the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged sho@@ res of the Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful you , &quot; it was told in another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble patient center , is near a synagogue .
the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident a &quot; failure &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; there was never a direct instruction &quot; to record Israel to the quick@@ en@@ sel@@ ing list , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code is now added .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly asc@@ ends to 71 % - RT Business
with the abol@@ ition of sanctions , according to Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Teheran , grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strong in the land , divided by the ambassador .
Russian companies taking existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to make access to the market .
of course , the further commercial building is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan said .
he noted that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports increased 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade down@@ turn was achieved by ship@@ ments of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year the Russian foreign agency had around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily for Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens .
furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns the tourist number in Russia .
one could say that the record pay Iranian tourists in Russia from last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians attend Iran , some of which the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

the stran@@ ts of the past@@ oral control unit Ey@@ em@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were handled .
in order to over@@ ride the time until the next Rom@@ antic trip of all the stran@@ ts in the past two years , the Federal Minister of Ministers has decided to prepare and determined a several days of pilgrimage .
various gel@@ ding destinations was examined and we finally decided to finally visit the Bisch@@ o@@ fs@@ city Freiburg , where in this year , during the Holy Year of Charity , in this year , Mer@@ cy was a special pilgrimage to commemor@@ ate the State of Münster , Germany .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and holy bedrooms were on the way .
in the evening before he sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was blessed and divided the pilgrimage .
he was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where a Mu@@ enster Arts was born and so the pilgrimage was reached from Münster .
the individual tours in the morning and in the evening were surrounded by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is started to cross country crosses , chap@@ els or churches again and again to sing together a song from a separate pilgri@@ m @-@ song .
for the nights , the parish church of the local parish were available .
in the stages of Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for tasty dinner and breakfast .
further on the second day , Fur@@ tw@@ angen went to G@@ üt@@ enbach in the second day .
in this regard , the stage was followed by St. Peter , which was the st@@ ress@@ ful road , but had to asc@@ end with a pup@@ il of 500 metres at first time and had to be heard again .
the deser@@ ved reward was a common grave in the evening in the evening .
after the dawn on the fourth pilgrimage in the imposing con@@ vent church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
confident and happy , the Min@@ is met in the later afternoon at the Frei@@ burger Mu@@ enster in the afternoon of Freiburg .
with a small impulse , God was ow@@ es here .
the Min@@ is , named by Ko@@ i Markus O@@ bert , were welcomed at the evening show in Münster .
after the divine service , pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ metro@@ pole .
in the afternoon there went back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong common experience were min@@ ted .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner over@@ comes home when Br@@ ite has won gold for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner ra@@ ste last night in the co@@ ats team spr@@ int in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the role that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igh@@ te@@ h . he made the legend , when he stor@@ med to home a victory of the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympics medals .
it repeated the trick that in March at the World Championships in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this time in time as a Hin@@ des .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap which attempted to close the K@@ ian em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ash .
S@@ kin@@ ner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the shr@@ ot@@ ting , which un@@ folds now .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won a Olympic champion , but in the qualifying rounds , the New Zealand took over in the first round .
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
after his lap was just short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and S@@ kin@@ ner carried it out .
a strategy of strategy turned out a large part of the transformation , by exec@@ uting it in a higher speed to slow it down , and to allow it to allow the pace to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell S@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they went on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name to me .
we have set up a Olympic champion in the final round and defe@@ ats the world champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the site Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , there was an indication that he deliberately led to the railway after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objec@@ tion of England &apos;s rival .
this time was not a problem with such an outstanding victory .
Hin@@ des said : &quot; it feels with all the UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot;
we came together in the last three months as a team .
we went so badly by so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that has won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a barometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect successful five days in the vel@@ o@@ drome for us .
with the shape of it , it is possible in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a sacred date for the British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster , was born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that &apos;s the coming of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ ely to win alone .
Hin@@ des said , &quot; If he won two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ um competition of the day , but there were further good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ke Wig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified for the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with a focus on safety .
yesterday , he was cont@@ ested in front of the qualification , when officials called for itself to measure his body size .
in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , continuing tomorrow and ends , av@@ anc@@ é Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team is leaving a strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and fet@@ ched a Sch@@ ar to medals .
an exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London were driven down the expectations for Rio .
it &apos;s been playing back in the background , so the resignation of the Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton &apos;s resignation in April in the midst of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ ul@@ ls as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks like this legendary GB@@ S , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , again .
the future of the melt of Portland , based on liqui@@ dation of the energy contract .
the future of aluminium mel@@ ts from Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers from workers - are on the game since the plant operator will announce the energy supply contract and thereby raise all the delivery contracts , as the supplier &apos;s energy companies can be announced .
this step led to the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to perform the plant .
a sub@@ sid@@ y for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa , Portland , stand on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs , direct and indirect - could be endangered at an end .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ gens , since the melt party consumes around 10 per cent of the total electricity production of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry Schmel@@ z@@ ei , which led to an closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of the Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and cra@@ cked an closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and last due to the electricity price for the system .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium sm@@ iles with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Latin , shared that it assumes that three additional owners will leave their contracts .
the facility is located in the complex of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p have smaller portions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melt adhesive , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L continued to have the so @-@ called &quot; securing transactions &quot; that will be force in force since November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on revenues to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of high cost markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L told that it has already written the value of contracts with $ 187 million in anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the Ab@@ ility of Alco@@ hol ... the Ab@@ ility of Alco@@ hol ... the hot@@ melt or the power supply to the melting pot cannot be affected .
the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into force from November this year , even if it is not guilty of explanation , why it came down from the contract .
analysts are war@@ n due to the poor economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near Newcastle .
in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said about 600 meg@@ awatts and Tom@@ ago will consume about 900 meg@@ awatts .
if both plants will disappear from the market , a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; would mean .
and for us as power generators you would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a lob@@ b@@ da reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the Vog@@ ue September issue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the H@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Cl@@ ans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ age of the U.S. Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , on Thursday the latest news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers to tears , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the unveil@@ ing of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s like ? ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ her@@ z @-@ On@@ cles and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she ends the cover of her sister and ending with a classic turn : they all have a surprise level .
this is the result of almost every birthday party of a children &apos;s departure ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You did that we would have forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to participate in this public@@ ity somehow .
with regard to the September @-@ September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of thes@@ es started .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim is telling what the Vog@@ ue cover is concerned ( they and their husband Kan@@ ye West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most popular edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
with a circum@@ ference , which resem@@ bles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine , the output is a large number of advertis@@ ers ( According to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ clo@@ ars is so lon@@ ely expected that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine is still le@@ ased out of the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the model &quot; as &quot; models , the celebr@@ ities &quot; are on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 at the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low probability that Mrs. J@@ enner is described by the magazine as the &quot; passage model &quot; of their generation - under the previous category , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to celebr@@ ities or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though it applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who are looking out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success to everyone .
with their reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ant &apos;s position was always sc@@ anned in the fashion world .
in June , the other Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ized her &quot; Mist@@ akes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings cook over again , when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue cover .
but riding on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the Vog@@ ue September issue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your floor of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell you pictures from their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells from her taken pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in their leisure time they can see in the reality TV . presumably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centres show 160@@ ,000 people every year
more than 160@@ ,000 people of the country have been exp@@ elled by the community centres annually , while the sector on the impact of further medi@@ ates are already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ im@@ ation and related issues - have been rejected for free legal advice and legal counsel .
legal services of the church , which are already over@@ exploited , are ready for additional cuts .
as of June next year , the legal centres will continue to lose more than 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the Municipal Council of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey conducted by the National Union of Municipal centers revealed that thousands of people are already rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse by the decision of the German government .
the Queens@@ bor@@ reli@@ osis Cent@@ res are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who aband@@ on violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and op@@ pres@@ sive debts , families who have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who are un@@ just@@ ly divor@@ ced - all these people have problems right way and this collection shows that they can not receive the assistance they need .
the federal government will reduce the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning thousands of hel@@ pers must be forced from Queensland with their legal problems without any help .
we demand the Federal Prosecutor and Justice of Queensland , as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise this medi@@ ator immediately , so people get the help they need for legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its promise to raise funds for legal rights on the national average .
it is now time to view the needs of the community centers and their customers , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey of Länder National Ele@@ ctions : SPD and CDU
during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses apply for the gover@@ ning party SPD and CDU .
this revealed representative surveys from the opinion research institute in all for the &quot; image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black governmental coalition could continue to rain in the north , this is not possible after re@@ frac@@ tures in Berlin .
in both states , the SPD would have the strongest party and would have good chances to continue the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party is only slightly ahead of the CDU that could return to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the African Republic .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
the Gre@@ ens proceeds despite slight decrease with 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) again in the heavy traffic day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented at 3 per cent each in the national day .
according to the Congress of Dep@@ uties of the Congress of Dep@@ uties , the SPD was only 23 per cent ( choice 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CDU was only 18 percent to 22.@@ 3.4 percent .
it is still behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for returning to the pirates , in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : the Nokia communic@@ ator was released on the market 20 years ago .
today , the followers domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer had a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogram , and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ cking .
the built @-@ in storage was at the beginning of eight meg@@ abytes , which would be sufficient for approximately two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
a iPhone is now available with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few Euro fans can buy lovers more in the internet , but they come from the rock time of internet era .
however 20 years ago , communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a couple of months earlier in C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West Bank format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for that time a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser , even qu@@ itting slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be looked similar to a laptop .
then found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white @-@ screen .
the price was very proud : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros .
no one could be found in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &apos; mobile phone card experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold at Microsoft .
the market today control vendors , which were all much later than Nokia .
being online and everywhere , this is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple are selling 5@@ 55 million pieces on Samsung and Apple .
the global turnover of equipment is around 400 billion euros .
these are also the well @-@ running business of the countless App vendors and the telecommunications market .
in the meantime , around the smartphone developed a whole industry .
the decisive breakthrough for the mass market came first in early 2007 , at that time , Apple has announced Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World to introduce the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a musician , a phone and a internet communications , easy to use by touch screen .
Apple began Apple &apos;s victory , still today the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the watch .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry got to fight .
now we have Apple and Asian providers as Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention , a self @-@ intel@@ li@@ ence .
today , the average of each German has 88 times a day to his mobile phone .
&quot; we need to learn all the smartphone even once , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel in the Siemens executive board .
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must drive the Olympic spirit and extend Heath@@ row
Heath@@ row is not only going to present in our local communities and in London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me , this was the largest attraction of the Heath@@ row , just as it was in London in 2012 , when we run a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions would have benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympics has great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will happen again by creating new possibilities for local authorities and companies in the vicinity of Heath@@ row .
for our local communities we are already 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces that create 40,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of the Heath@@ row extension is too large .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will fade all on the world stage .
the bi@@ fl@@ yers had in@@ justice in 2012 and they are also lying in Heath@@ row .
there are always obstacles in the crash , but Heath@@ row answers every question .
like the Olympic Games , Heath@@ row is for many and not for individual a infrastructure project .
enlargement is an option to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ty growth and a legacy of skills and employment to leave the airport as well as in all GB .
we have a great team in Heath@@ row which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the 2012 London Games were a great success for UK and I am confident that Heath@@ row &apos;s extension will also be one .
it is time that we expand this Olympic spirit and extend our future business as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs in which England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding indicators
for businesses that make money with On@@ line@@ ages money come out according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to avoid ad block@@ ers , a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block displays on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ gger , in which it was shared that users could update their filters in the program to lock again advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook tells that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the coating on his advertis@@ ements to make it beat the recognition of it which is part of the page advertising to make it harder .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blo@@ c post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the pointing an open source community and conver@@ ters already exists since the invention of advertis@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest enterprises in social media has launched in the struggle is a powerful indication , as wor@@ r@@ ying into the industry .
according to a study published last year from Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people are watching sco@@ re@@ ments ; almost four times so much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion users active users who access Facebook through their mobile end devices , hand@@ y@@ public@@ ity makes up 84 percent of advertising revenue .
the company has no effect on display block devices on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block does not have an effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large share of revenues , so that Facebook is the investment of such a pac@@ emaker as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook tells us that there would be an &quot; advertis@@ ements pri@@ zep@@ ool , &quot; to facilitate the people more control over them .
on Thursday Facebook says that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ r@@ ying new filters , because they would not block any content on the side , which are no advertising .
&quot; for the users there is no positive experience , therefore , we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message .
indicators are a dum@@ b means , why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of people .

however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avo@@ id@@ able ?
that is something of the prosecutor &apos;s attor@@ ney , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not being moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - there was a person in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the motor@@ ists have not to go out that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman of the cas@@ ual killing was acquitted after having crossed over a man and killed one night on the A1 in the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim was drunk , and he was un@@ conscious of the street .
the court ordered that the police had responded to an emergency call -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report at the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ o@@ dell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
Venus was , according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , probably once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorith@@ ms , similar to those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine if Venus could have been identified with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once des@@ d@@ like conditions .
scientists have previously noted that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , penet@@ rated atmosphere and nevertheless turned on slowly .
the model also lit the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry places than de earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected against much more ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was around 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow shift of Venus will exp@@ ire their day &apos;s side almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that works like an umbrella to remove the surface from a large part of solar heat .
the results are average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution of evolution ever since .
although it was likely to be inhab@@ itable , Venus -- fell too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans are ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burnt away from ultra@@ violet light .
when their Hydro@@ gen revol@@ ted only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , that as we know it today .
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a trainer and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Academy in the Colorado and led to a low @-@ determination decision in the team decision .
alternative President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will seek immediately after a new coach .
&quot; in the past three years I have accepted my duties as Music Director and Vice President Of The Hockey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy believed in a statement .
in the course of summer long and much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth to give him a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the train@@ ers and vice president of hockey operations need to be perfectly matched to the organisation .
he also has to decide on decisions determining the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his team for his team .
Patrick today informed me about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all that he did for our organization and wish him only the best .
during his debut season in the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , the winner of the Jack Adams Awards were awarded the best coach of the League .
he led the association to 112 points and placed first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten at the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and adjusted in each of the two last years the post@@ season .
in the 2015 @-@ 16 season , the Aval@@ an@@ ches signed a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stanley C@@ ups - two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ ee@@ pers take up talks again , put on strike
the workers strug@@ gles concerning the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Se@@ as workers are suspended , while all the parties sit for a new talk round on the table , the negoti@@ ator said .
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were held spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ ushes trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ boot the winding process of the current dispute , &quot; it says in a common statement .
we will hold some full day meetings in the coming weeks , which will start at the beginning next year to re @-@ start the problems .
the trade unions said that her last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , has a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has cut the rates to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating follows a 10 % drop for on@@ shore contra@@ ctors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the necessary space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has announced for its part of thousands of people and give plans to give up his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as its business activities are ration@@ alised with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure at a lower Ro@@ of prices under pressure , a economic situation that was intensi@@ fied by the British &apos;s decision in June , the European Union .
the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders in order to discuss one of the biggest employers in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion spending on new projects in the North Sea are expected to increase at an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star@@ board of the Ple@@ y@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler World space sc@@ opes was helped to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star@@ board of Ple@@ y@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars are related to different rates , as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods are available with planetary controls .
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ ing of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star@@ board of the Ple@@ y@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years away from Earth .
many stars in this cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak mar@@ gins , these mature stars drive large quantities from star@@ ches .
because these winds are travelling through the fields of magnetic fields , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is sha@@ ken , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation of each star , taking the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- as s@@ ungl@@ asses - recognizes .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are more than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , although larger stars are swi@@ ft@@ able pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller .
&quot; at the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ y@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas fast fans tend to be , very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star@@ board of the Ple@@ y@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star@@ ring of the Ple@@ y@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull .
there is still much ahead of us what we like to learn more about how , when and why stars are slow down their rot@@ ations and so to say their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of stro@@ kes of the Ple@@ y@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star enters
the tears run faster than the US bas@@ eball star in best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional return it will be the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional on August 12 against the T@@ ampa Bay Ra@@ ys one last time the tri@@ cot of his new York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to both &apos; , declared the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants of major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
in three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
its signature under a tenth deal has been ratified by 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contrast on December 31 , 2017 he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Nav@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to have some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members , H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e Ma@@ ys show only two bas@@ eball player in the major statistics similar to values .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be recorded in the glory of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was so controversial of his appearance outside the square .
as early as 2009 , the super@@ star has been involved in &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , prohibited ster@@ oids .
in August 2013 , he was locked up for 211 games due to a processing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ guez is considered the prime suspect , for years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; the League could even have done a pleasure for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez then said at that time .
his farewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games played the big stage , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not contain a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; corro@@ ded Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ insky are first d@@ oping cases
caught : because of a positive d@@ op@@ ing@@ sample , weight li@@ fter can not start Adrian Ziel@@ insky from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - Olympic Games 2016 will be o@@ vers@@ ha@@ do@@ wed by the first official dates .
an experienced Ath@@ let@@ tering would have been almost a medal .
the first official dates of the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games have become known before the seventh competition event .
the Chinese swimming pool in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and the Polish weigh@@ t@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ insky have been positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the le@@ ath@@ le@@ tical ath@@ le@@ tics competitions this news will come to the accident .
for Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tics has been demonstrated by hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de , which is used as a m@@ asked means for d@@ oping sub@@ cut@@ aneously .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sport@@ Court CA@@ S confirmed its departure from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 year old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the demonstrations over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
in the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing .
the national association took the matter &quot; very seriously and demands Ch@@ en full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sport@@ Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio se@@ ep the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive by himself .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be a dietary supplement , &quot; explained the ath@@ lete &apos;s ath@@ lete .
according to the report , it is said to deal with the banned substance around the EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was given provisional release , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ trial is also already positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow promp@@ ted criticism of the ath@@ lete &apos;s ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not pull the proper slaugh@@ tering , &quot; he said , &quot; We Bulg@@ arians under observation , as many have been exp@@ elled . &quot;
thus , approximately every weigh@@ t@@ li@@ fter can not participate in the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation in Rio .

before the start of athletes , in particular , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is another serious blow for the reputation of the total sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had submitted the entire Russian crew to an exception due to systematic d@@ op@@ ings to start the start , even in Rio , numerous bad news will also be produced in Rio .
in the case of swimming @-@ sport , in China , too , the former con@@ frontation between the athletes were gathered .

dat@@ ashe@@ ets : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses ch@@ acker your rans@@ om
programm@@ ers of contact malware can currently rely on targeted companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware @-@ defense specialists in North America , UK and Germany 40 percent of surveyed companies surveyed have at least once , some multiple victims of a attack with the press@@ er software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies had already been the goal of a Ran@@ som@@ o @-@ press@@ .
40 per cent of the victims paid will@@ ingly provided by the perpet@@ rators required to take advantage of the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alise in their em@@ press software according to the observations by Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attack in company network .
if they are successful there , the potential savings are considerably higher than in private use .
&quot; we are currently watching a sc@@ ary fast evolution of the malware software , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes leader Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most of the painters were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the pressing software for themselves .
only private use was the target , but the change to corporate att@@ acking took place over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware is working according to a simple pattern : once active upon the computer of an optional , it is looking for un@@ long modified files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encrypted the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
subsequently , the software presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the discretion .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims need money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin - point .
but where the personal photo @-@ database is based on the game , it is about firms for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage fails , if a Ran@@ som@@ o suggests .
22 percent of German companies reported revenues losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to run business activities , in case of a case people were in danger of danger .
in Germany many hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients could be threatened with loss of ambul@@ ances .
&quot; we say the victims always : pay not that it promotes only the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in view of the stand@@ still .
the h@@ ackers turn again , and attempt to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the safety researcher of F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the pres@@ by@@ ists and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you explain their sacrifices by chat as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free access web sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for example files .
and if private individuals are saved after payments by a few hundred euros , companies must pay a part hard , and pay five digits of sum@@ s to get their data un@@ turn@@ key .
in view of potentially high and relatively ris@@ ol@@ ly profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware discretion the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
more likely , however , is that it is about three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their malware infection in the form of a software package to the actual Er@@ press@@ er .
the malware kits were created by making malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; delivery includes a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the claim@@ er then search for further h@@ ackers , to spread the newly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so , one log@@ ged in one of the forums in the underground , buys the set of a criminal and manager another way to install the software on as many PCs .
payment is done per in@@ ferred calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als apply to dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
Ran@@ som@@ o &apos;s risk is now known for many companies that make their data better .
over 50 percent of companies IT @-@ developers in the mal@@ war@@ y pol@@ l depend on how to defend Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ Back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone no sufficient threat to successful recovery is more , the perpet@@ rators instead , with the release of sensitive data such as some customer lists or price lists , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes leader Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this means that the potential of damage , depending on the type of data , is higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators also could completely take new goals on the Internet of things on the Internet .
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference D@@ con demonstrated safety researchers , as they were able to control a thermo@@ stat with the Internet connected thermo@@ stat .
in the middle of winter , the rele@@ asing of a kind blocked heating could definitely be a rans@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators will then block a whole production line instead of heating in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ proof
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack it all : a little SUV , a little Coupé , and even the vers@@ atility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sound pretty un@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually proved very flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and in the rear , no place works closely .
the materials of the interior are well processed and make pleasant , only the cockpit @-@ top drops off there anything .
versatile as comparable vehicles , the HR @-@ V is the storage space .
it is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l in high @-@ quality and 10@@ 26 l in folded back @-@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less mag@@ ically , as it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded as Kin@@ os@@ essel &apos;s seat and offer a storage space that is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the load @-@ height with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine delivers 88 kW / 120 hp , the HR @-@ V acceler@@ ates very powerful thanks to the torque value of up to 300 Nm .
however , he should set out a little qui@@ eter out of his job .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine variant : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline unit with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering is likely to be a bit more likely .
the equipment has no wishes to be desired in the tested top version &quot; Executive . &quot;
the City @-@ Not@@ ary assistant ( operates until speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the track assistant .
the coll@@ ision was irrit@@ ated sometimes because he evaluated many obstacles as a &quot; organizing objects . &quot;
the remote control assistant is very reliable .
and the intelligent speed regul@@ ators react to the traffic signs and dro@@ s@@ sel@@ t when needed .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore something aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is in order .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the petrol engine will receive 20,000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday @-@ day car .

better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
there is a regular basis on the surrounding road - here a picture of November .
but this shall change : the legal turns should be extended .
this is a good news for all motor@@ cyclists who stand in the professional traffic on the surrounding street every night in the stand , when they drive over the motorway ( A 43 ) .
the road building extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the departure of Wes@@ er Straße at 700 meters .
drivers can then mount right from the Hammer Road to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early , thus making the overall mark on the much higher section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the Group &apos;s headquarters in Münster @-@ West .
the car train on the br@@ itt@@ inger ner@@ ves the drivers from all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the back@@ stage goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path , and sometimes even beyond .
this is why the Nec@@ kl@@ ö@@ hr on the B 51 is just ahead of the departure of Wes@@ eler Street .
from here , traffic is just one lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built well , three @-@ four@@ ths of years ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge won &apos;t exceed the required load capacity , in order to absorb moisture levels above all .

relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening you will be wander@@ ing around , at night you wake up hours up , in the morning long before bed@@ bugs are not thinking of sleep anymore .
that is all others as relaxing .
after all , there is no problems with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep sleeping disorders and over ten percent do not find their sleep frequent or permanently re@@ spa@@ wn .
how far sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many causes of causes , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , board member of the German Society for Sle@@ eve and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
but what we understand under it is the in@@ som@@ ite , that is , therefore , an entry and sle@@ epl@@ ess disorder .
just going to sleep well , many people find out as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wagner &apos;s co @-@ member of the German household association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
it is behind organic , psychological , or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication .
no rare is the disorder &apos;s sleep expression of a different disease .
&quot; very early awak@@ ening is frequent in case of depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it can be that different factors are in one another .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes every two to three hours and starts to medit@@ ate about everyday problems and -@@ care for greetings , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should people sleep with sleep problems to the doctor ?
those who should not sleep well over a month period of at least three nights a week and is imp@@ aired on the day should consult a doctor .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , exhausted , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood s@@ wings or physical ail@@ ments like gast@@ ric or headache .
to relie@@ ve the sleep problem , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options include behavi@@ oral changes , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy , or drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and more for two weeks - in@@ quire .
situated in Germany , there are scar@@ c@@ ely hardly points out in Germany , st@@ resses Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of Inter@@ disciplinary Sle@@ epers at the Char@@ ité University Clinic in Berlin .
that &apos;s why you should contact sleeping difficulties first at the doctor advis@@ ing that We@@ e@@ ß is advis@@ able .
it can clari@@ fy with investigations , if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what has happened ?
for an investigation in the sleeping laboratory , an example of snor@@ ing with respiratory failure , at bed@@ time , or if you do not find the cause of a sle@@ epl@@ ess disorder .
we don &apos;t have to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; just make no nap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after wi@@ do@@ cks one goes into bed for his normal time .
in addition to the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nas@@ al g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ el@@ ight on the finger .
it is also characterized by a camera on the ceiling .
how can people get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of screws , to which one can make for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß is on : regular sleeping and rising time , not too long in bed , not to sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch - then you start to calculate immediately , and that &apos;s quite and not eligible .
what the Jung@@ le camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold himself as a dis@@ appo@@ inting cutting of DS@@ V teams at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time in Doha and took his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has put on his protective into the ex @-@ team mate via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where the Olympi@@ ad gets € 20,000 , and there is no one of € 150,000 , no one should be surprised about lack of medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote to Friday on his Facebook page .
the con@@ veying system in swim sports may be bad , the d@@ oping controls are very good .
so we can not compete with countries that promote very much and can &apos;t even watch the topic of d@@ oping .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be adjusted here , &quot; he explained further .
if he wanted to launch a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have had to launch nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to be able to control a certain time before WM / OS of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A may not participate , &quot; the option of Hamburger , who has now operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of Car@@ ri@@ cul@@ min@@ ors arrested
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at the airport Düsseldorf
on Thursday the local police received the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects were perpet@@ rated as a gang of several T@@ ash@@ ings and carrier steels .
at 21.@@ 30 exposed civilian officials at the airport of Düsseldorf airport , a gang that was known to police officers from past theft .
the two women and two men had celebrated several delic@@ ac@@ ies since mid @-@ July and were in common , working and especially professional .
the specialists of the Krimin@@ al@@ im@@ un@@ ari@@ ats 34 can submit to the th@@ ie@@ ves who had visited one of his alleged crimes in Germany .
in total , they were carried out over 15,000 euros .
Alt@@ built , a few lin@@ seed back@@ packs , in between still a rest of pil@@ ing stone : the Rig@@ id street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in operates at first glance not yet , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of town .
go along the street from the east to the west , one comes to places , a refresh@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone has spotted &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; to the façade of a grey house . &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl that will soon be demolished , it will be built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , is illustrated by com@@ bu@@ stible cars in the last few weeks .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was busy , meanwhile the inhabitants have lease income , but on the ground floor , however , rooms are still occupied and are used for events .
especially the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ ator Henkel had been several times for a tough pre@@ diction of police against the project by the beginning of the year against the project &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , had been cleared with 300 police officers , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three club cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated building workers on behalf of unknown house owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the evacu@@ ation had been illegal , and one day later police and construction workers led among the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street seems peace@@ fully : parents go with children , people sit on pav@@ ement at the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tained in late late .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin objects are a primary school and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens .
left hand is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kiev &apos;s Kie@@ z , and J@@ ana * , who are three children here , are primarily gener@@ ously driven by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the bon@@ ding projects , they share concern with wor@@ r@@ ying and gent@@ l@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wish to give a majority of police officers in front of v@@ andal@@ on the left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ ator and the police open between house owners and their neighbours , does not exist so obviously .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; neighborhood , which also has a lower average risk compared to the rest of the city .
the house occupied and the only native residential projects belong to the Kiev family : many houses were occupied by the former East Germany , including nearly the entire Main Street , close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under large police officers in a real road @-@ battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alised in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly becoming the mag@@ nets for tourists and voting liner from around the world : with them now people are share from the GDR &apos;s time and former home @-@ house places .
this also makes itself noticeable in the r@@ allies who have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ s are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognize them on the designed discs , or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were being thrown with coloured bags .
no other street was mentioned this year as often with the words &quot; Left @-@ Independent Viol@@ ence . &quot;
a reason for that not all neighbours can view it as a problem , might be that it is not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes are doing property damage , which ten@@ ds to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of un@@ certainty .
as for violence is concerned , they are ai@@ ded : people in the 94 are their neighbours that were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars admit it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er last longer .
for the architect of architect , their street is not a criminal case , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , live together on the street and gets more than one another . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consci@@ ously moved into the rig@@ ging road - and stayed .
this is why it was so important that the people have returned its way : from the police , the politics and the media , which all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by character@@ less new buildings in former construction g@@ aps that for@@ ti@@ fy the old residents .
&quot; these are all con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many here - here , rather people who are not so good , &quot; says it .
&quot; violence and destruction I absolutely not have gu@@ a@@ thei@@ m . &quot;
but what can you do when someone hears it ?
it reli@@ es on all sides fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for dra@@ fts using colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin objects and the left @-@ scene belonged to a pine .
anyone who moves , should be aware of it - just like someone who walks in a pub quarter but difficult to compl@@ ain about noise .
everybody with first names presented , have asked , not to be called with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officers
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in matters of integration and organizer .
in addition , she is a social worker .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee agency for Ur@@ bach since July .
social ped@@ agog@@ ues support the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working for refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else join us .
Reg@@ ine client from the working group indicates that the honorary citizen is more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the jeal@@ ous wool mil@@ ch@@ sau , who has a problem in particular .
so some - less mo@@ cked as much as much more on the multitude of sub@@ sist@@ ence levels - meant , as the administration intended to write the place .
we are looking for an administrative comp@@ assi@@ onate with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long@@ standing experience in the field of social work , even a jeal@@ ous wo@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
however , administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
especially it is about organization , work with people on site and behind the scenes , as well as network management .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been taking part since around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was great time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ x Ehr@@ ing and full @-@ time players are supported .
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers are located in the Was@@ enstraße
it has been a grave problem for some time , which have been recognized for the connection of the connection .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they need to accommodate refugees in their own or hired living rooms .
the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation needs to wear the municipalities .
the responsibility changes from Land@@ rat@@ es@@ man to Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult since some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
it does not work until now , you have to rely on Private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , the host@@ ile apartments must be adjusted , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le are log@@ ged in .
in addition to a fixed stay , training places , training places , school grounds , single @-@ euro jobs and staff activities for refugees and migrants who have to be frozen or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do not do profit , and motivated and very tidy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
it does not only mean work .
day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer .
people would have to develop a rig@@ orous @-@ feeling .
so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also jump here administration and honorary posts .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long term of procedure is a problem .
they need to explain the refugees that it will just take it and take time to ad@@ u@@ ct them , for example with language courses .
who sometimes feels the feeling of developing , he could not be able to work in Ur@@ bach , you should not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate .
the clear majority was motivated .
problem cases there is , however , say customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; work by Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer may always be motiv@@ ating others to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth job . &quot;
a difficult question : do both of them have fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small church such as Ur@@ bach ?
no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are sensiti@@ zed .
these inci@@ dents may be subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks have come complete them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would love to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so major and honorary posts need to look out on site and in the region to activities .
yet they always have in the background that soon a new impact of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
to answer this question clearly , the policy dis@@ cour@@ aged .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived there , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , this would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine client also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher has even been utilized to fully integrate all of the people &apos;s sensible people .
these are about 100 persons , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , one must help them , both women agree .
the political situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .
