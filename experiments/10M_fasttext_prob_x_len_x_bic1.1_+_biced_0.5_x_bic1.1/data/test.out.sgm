<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent trading agreement TTP - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, none of the two US presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump tries to keep the doubts rather small and warns against what the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to punish the economy and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different against it, claimed Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will continue to regain massively, and he makes himself strong for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates - for private professionals and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said: the state has certain duties to fulfil, he has open the disadvantaged chances and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">So the tax would increase to the rich, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be invested in the needs, Trump and Clinton say almost like that.</seg>
<seg id="14">The applicant has not announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are stripped by the state-critical Teaparty wings of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">At Trump, there could be still party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">More significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and back up the coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion should also be possible in so protected areas, the Paris climate agreement wants to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to expand the renewable energy with its investment program, and demands: "a country will create the superpower of the clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpiazija trade agreement, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time both they want to isolate themselves from international trade, but just protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid even better, Clinton said.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of $7,25 is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it down to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What trump do in that question isn't quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rise, then he says he shall not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the tax policy of both bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, which wants to stimulate the economy and citizens to stimulate growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics stop him, that the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to ask at least of the rich, wants to pay more taxes and their critics: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "any winged woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who are alone, almost everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby, which is at most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her small son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He guakes with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother is starred on the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until it notices that it is watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene doesn't work normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is the division of the Condrobs business director, a vehicle for social help in Bavaria, and among others, dealing with the topic women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen have fled.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich, one of the few decentralised accommodation for all women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condembs signed the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are none - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated: any woman who comes here is on her escape experience with sexual violence," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted because they did torture or death, or because their families are sending them to Europe," they are telling them.</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, other reasons for the escape: "many are secretly stewed them, because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experienced experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honoratory, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it continues.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, tug to demand a bottle of water a sexual act is no rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that the end, as soon as they swim in Germany, explains, Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here, single women in refugee camps would often be considered to be mindful and worse were abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This causes about 90 percent of women who live in the area of Munich, traumatised, appreciates them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women be so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the living, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often do not need to help, it only need more accommodations for them, calls for Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments for the accommodation of refugees are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they were lying about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is something similar to the governments of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia alone, women were not being accommodated themselves, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press secretary of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle franken, there are some common floors or own homes for single-standing women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and gender equality," in the European Parliament, calls for women to be accommodated by men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the committee, it is said: "it is very important that men and women will be hosted separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy or women and women are accommodated together, it can come to - ongoing violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the shower room should be separately accessible and accessible to women, stands in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women feel of this protection need, you can read on the Andres, which is to be found on the Munich House.</seg>
<seg id="48">He has been talking about since we have been around, we have a long waiting list, "says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily get a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputy Assistant of assistants have called their union to approve new labour measures in their dispute relating to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has requested his entire Council to approve more labour measures starting at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that it would have been minister to decide on the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistants and medical students have agreed to agree on the refusal of a contract that has been agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members who voted for the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members who was posted on Thursday night on Thursday, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "beinsisting peaceful" problems, which led to the conclusion that the contract was rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said, "In view of this, the JDC of directors agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and challenged first new negotiations."</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the silence of the government the JDC's bureau today announced a formal application for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a ongoing program of escalating labour which begins in early September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to the assistance of assistance in the year six times, the first overall failures in the history of NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the BMA Registrar, Dr. Johann Malawana, came to the rejection of the agreed contractual conditions which had been recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">He shared the BMA members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54.000 assistants and medical students, with that the contract should be advantageous and accepted.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the treaty was introduced for physicians in England.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up the hands and proclaim an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes its Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I can't reject myself the impression that Ankara wants to take this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the hand, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin worked very narrow and radiated hardly any heat, even for its business conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper that Erdogan would have behaved so much more than would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to signify the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin dissembled, sustainable cows showed that the government of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his execution: the downing of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow was impacted at the time.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin parted and accused Ankara to be content of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The delay was even greater, since it has been committed by a supposed boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetrw will be rebuilding up again, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Since November, the public opinion in Russia has changed.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the nationally controlled media resulted in a severe, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed, the Turks would bear the blame for all.</seg>
<seg id="21">The accusations of officials confirmed that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin was received from President Erdogan to excuse which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind win.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire is clear in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily interested in all the friends that he can get after he failed last month at a failed coup d'état.</seg>
<seg id="28">The terrorist attacks on Turkey took him also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban of charter flights that each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and chartercompanies will be relieved if the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal route of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television predicts cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are not permitted.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated this: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West, since its reaction to the attempted coup was considered a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">For this purpose, persisting Groll on the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is erased to benefit from cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian head of State won a bonus for the decision that he requested a coup d'etat for the elected Public Prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-understood for Moscow, which itself has a profound fear of regime.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this glittering palace of the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one that once described me an analyst once described, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that get rid of the West and have been treated badly by the West.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, between the two still great differences exist.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently delivered the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support other sites.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be indicative that after almost three hours of first discussions at the press conference, they said that they didn't even understand the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey mied it intentionally on a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, as NATO member Turkey gave the Russian battle-jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="4">Ross McEwan distributed the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand joined the Bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since then the Bank has distanced itself almost kollabated and had to be saved almost eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Brand RBS "brand members have used this time to protect other end users.</seg>
<seg id="7">They supported the international sport with millions of pounds to Sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not initialize.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RSB are references, the decentralized head office and stock exchange to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other small brands for private banking, which will receive more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEWAN was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He divided the BBC Scotland with: "the RSB brand will become our investment brand as well as the brand, among which our employees will be busy, as we now become more to a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">As the Bank itself became a global brand, RBS became global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I now say that we do not pursue global goals, but also local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be completely different in its own communities for something completely different, and our employees will work among these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will not continue to continue its Six Nations Sponsorship and that it will increase the perception of various brands in his sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to develop into the Bank of brands, as we concentrate on inside (we asked) to make this a better Bank for customers?" said the President of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago, when we said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched this brand.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you'll see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can relaunch these stamps again, so I think that time has come.</seg>

<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website, it is (in Russian) that he later was head of the governing head and head of government officials.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important role of government to support your activity as a state of law on legislation and controls to the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian television station on Friday with that IVANOV asked about to leave his post and Vaino recommended as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step was made mysterious in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey IVANOV was a long time of a close confidence in Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin who was broadcasted on TV, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff had come back at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile of fleeing for the cameras, few of them are convinced here, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So this is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion, that a man, who once praised himself as a potential president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed on great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks related to Putin, who are cited on the website of the Kremlin, IVANOV said "it's true that I asked you in a conversation with this very complicated post - you could almost tell - complained about four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the position in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Constitutional Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, IVANOV was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin got to power he called IVANOV as one of five people he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was said that IVANOV could be President of Russia's second term, as a third term of putting Putin to the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken from another, seamless ally's coup, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was elected Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected to the north deck of the Queensde crossover network with Viaduct - which means that the bridge is connected to Fife now.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four appointments of the "cover fan," which approaches to the construction of each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge construction stage of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 steel ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Minister for Economic Affairs Keith Brown took a visit to the site today and was one of the first to join the country on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queensde crossover network.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineering with a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the sealing between Viaduct and the bridge deck is a finicky activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the pass.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck at its place and the last section of the Decks gets a concrete kiss to the deck today, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge at its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first clasp is a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the shutter is the forward-looking high-speed and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last road cut and its connection with the north tower deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or road page.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling in the northern edge of 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very finicky activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled down at an incline of about 3% upwards.</seg>
<seg id="19">Heats, as the tolerances, which the team works, were tiny - at each side, they were only some millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Braunschweigs cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens said: investors must be much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 affordable housing over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "hand-concept living" for the next ratory session.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A rule is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">S & D Group president Christoph Dalmann says: "we are united with the Greens: he who wants to build on urban areas will have to offer 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be created in stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">The big deal in the town hall is, however, as violas: "how do people want to build on private areas?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal residential construction program, which will cost millions of costs and must still be financed for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, as violas: "there is no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left will still use hardness regulations for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of what Bratmann, bait, enforced the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the framework concept is implemented, it will be responsible for additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">The program is not yet completely: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compare the loss of some 1,300 cheap apartments whose support will run out in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planner spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the town's ongoing ties.</seg>
<seg id="24">Besides, I would have to think about to take apartments again into the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">To solve this, the problem soles.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city run at the end of the year 2010.</seg>
<seg id="28">Approximately 1800 apartments could be found there in the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: we don't want to do the owners, the residential construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since then, the number of social housing in the west city is drastically increased, it is removed from the target of the so-called movement.</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social infirmities in just a few quarters should not give it more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will be even more movement in discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">S & D Group president Holger Herlitschke writes: "a vast majority must the CDU out of the ship."</seg>
<seg id="34">I have concentrated on more building sites for family homes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating, how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child are unable to walk outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time to starve on screens, has been complained in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Pokemon's Go, it's about to get people from the sofa and be more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The screen was initially limited to TV, then video games, and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hence, it's great to see that technology and activities outside not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, a app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later a character set, playing cards and other Spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of popculture sunk interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was moved through massive demand, which overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players start out with their smartphone looking for out and looking for Pokémons who have been followed with a GPS and as soon as they were found, "photographed" (on a screenshot of the mobile phone) or "caught."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was even younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that rescued the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiff, an app for Apple Watch, which followed 35,000 users, divided the Washington Post recently, that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - only the raw data is to increase output.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public reconnaissance campaigns for health, people want to take a "30 minute time" to "" "" "" to "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports can not be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drives sport reduces his chances to tackle cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that people bring people to do something in the open, that it is fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close their hunt, even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">Anyway, there are also mürrical toys that always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps, like Fitbit, could already follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemons's success there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people to be hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="17">It was a final exam in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athlete, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I present in the gymnasium in the gymnasium and for more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been at every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this crew has three trumpet, Simone Bales, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, inspired by many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this crew, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, round off, makes every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has carved the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is showing strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among the recent Olympic Games Gabby Douglas attracted a surprising Olympic winner and rejoicing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible power of the triple world champion in Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they were unexpected, but masterful Gymastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual battle event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but so you do not see gym classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympics has only four speakers in the team. moreover, the last year with Marta Karolyi is a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks so that turtle is a more expensive sport and gymnasts in the first place in private gyms that are maintained by parents, which will come up for the training, installation, travel clothing, travel clothing, and hotel costs (for the coach and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these are in wealthy suburbs, which can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these societies, Turner will receive its entire workout and it is for the families a devexpensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Bales, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they began with the Turk.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to make the municipalities with countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a secure and easily accessible fitness training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have created my turnout of 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events we have trained free and affordable gymnasium in Harlem for more than 15,000 rural young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth of high-quality gymnasium who make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness of the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides a lifelong benefits for health and education and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to get interested in the gymnasium and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thank you Fass her so many young girls with different background motivated to start their path, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anti-inflammatory drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for persons with a heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer from heart attack every year and one quarter of it suffers a heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the collect greedian material in the arteries that are forming layers.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer falls apart, it can cause a blood clots that clogged the blood flow to the heart, thereby causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots dissolves, it can flow through the flow of blood and blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Individuals who had already had a heart attack, are subject to a higher risk of developing a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making formation of blood clots unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The connection design of NICE, which has been published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health care Centre, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack had suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">Fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively prevents heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are happy that we are able to extend battery options available to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years. the intolerance bill should not be treatment that proceeded over this period.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of the Political Correctness leaves elections in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Luta Rahman was removed last year on the release of a government report on corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to that widespread electoral fraud was wired in Muslim communities such as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former Cabinet of Sir Eric Pickles intervenes with the police, election observers, and city houses to have evidence of voting rights regarding ethnicity and religion. "</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister for Integration and Communal Government, which is now an anti-corruption, said that the police should be permitted from religious motives so that the police should be allowed to establish locked bands outside of election cabins for intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should lead an identification card to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the moment, electors have to name only his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes unavoidable ink on the finger of a person inflating it when they empower their electoral voice, in order to prevent someone chooses it twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblower should receive greater protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this does not only serve against electoral fraud but should also protect the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial cultivation of finance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets electoral scandals east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court decided that the current mayor of Luton Rahman according to a Litanei to corrupt and illegal practices of his amber.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had acted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in the cynical way," and that he would have put their critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman should have conducted his campaign on the basis that there is a reliant duty of Muslims to choose him. "</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or as a result of a reimitation, when one person chooses others.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there would be evidence throughout the country's country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He voiced particularly alarming to the fraudulent paper selection - if the elderly members of the Muslim community had pressurized people to elect a candidate in their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the election system, including the coloring of evidence to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report, it says: "as proof was appropriate that pressure on the needy members of some ethnic minorities was administered, in particular women and young people, in accordance with the Will of the Elder, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="24">Consider options, voters off the choice after your identification.</seg>
<seg id="25">Unavoidable ink on the finger of a person, once they have left their voice, to prevent anyone chooses it twice.</seg>

<seg id="31">Photographers in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English in the election stations must be used (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training, to ensure that the staff will rule out that voters will leave alone in the voting cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astounding" that after the Tower Hamlets, no criminal complaint was placed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral tribunal has Luton Rahman and his deputy for corruption in corruption and illegal practices," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty because of a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high demands on the grounds of the criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the effective "Abhakcontrol" of the Rathetaker's election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the trials in Tower Hamlets of last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our country carries a pride itself as the mother of the parliaments, but the worrying and concealed spread of electoral fraud and leugal some authorities threaten this good reputation.</seg>

<seg id="10">"each staring, when they rushed out the substitutes, which you obviously didn't like it, because they put them back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">She repeated the same with three other submissions, before finally decided that you did nothing right, and went out and out.</seg>

<seg id="3">We talked with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to walk armed with armed prey on the distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or at the back, this video will show how you turn around your predators to the skewers.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you accept from behind you, then you should rotate as an extension, so that you can see your attackers and give them out of the line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon in front of your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with the knees in the body and rotate, while the Attacker is squeezed out, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backward while they align the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">When attackers, who are approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the cast line, grab the weapon and rotate it, so that the Attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Place at the same time the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its handle, before moving backwards and straightening the weapon to him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller drew its immune system and wordeflex of a serious test - opposed to some of the dirtiest and most reputable places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and itautor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk moved his course on a euro sheet, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing pot and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the leasing of every object, it used a luminometer to show and show us what it is going to be effected.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed by the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the rinse knob of a encores, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely impulsive, but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and over his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left that he rejected, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of its intestines by travelling the world as well as wonderful things, as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to railway stations up to rushing pieces of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about what my health is concerned and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, soil, worms and sludge."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was definitely just a fair.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its proofing material showed a Luminometric number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometric number is fresh-washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak after her Luminometric number was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "that comes to the worst thing I have gerled in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here, because here is drinkable.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength "was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer users really new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that's fascinating for watching and at the same time explains the advantages of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led mad brainstorings by the end that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led directing the film, added: "let me tell me - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him, like the Russian toilet which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian, to lick it and others, where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty tricks on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a conducted survey carried out by the year 2015, 84 percent of those surveyed said Militiy bacteria, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products which contain both lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare-Year, Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Mary as a tragic love story, like Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">With this, a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical captured Salzburg: the West Side Story, "Lejoking Bernsteins masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director of Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical role in the classical music and fulfilled himself with the role of Mary a youth mare.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra he digged the Simón Bolívar Symphony conducted by the Venezuelan Conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm,"</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernsteins of music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging, Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She recalls with arrogance with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dance.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary is always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because they are quite unusual!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She tells her in her song: "I had earned Pretty, oh so Pretty, I Featuring Pretty and witty and Bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">It is therefore smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is quite similar to me, my Italian character whom I used as Roman," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is so honour to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">She is an enormous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli gives the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artists and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a need for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">One sees it in every his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It's such an enormous chance to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" in this piece for prejudices and fanatism. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we took the refugees, at that time, the Pudoorians went to New York, and the New York citizens did not want them.</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever does not fit and commits Erdogan is seated in packed suitcases," says the end of the Gülen-near foundation dialogue and the world, Ercan Karakoyun.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany anticipates tens of thousands of people who fled from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the medium term, there could even be "a few hundred thousand," the chief Apostle Ali Toprak believes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of the harsh approach by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Kurdish church of Germany expects a mass curses to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey, when the Erdogan regime fought against minorities and democratic opposition," says the commander Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because the government had covered up Kurdish strongholds with penal actions before months, 500,000 Kurds would be on the move within Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="8">Following the sealed coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would add.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will begin to restart in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it can't be that a state that takes itself refugees in their own country," said Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chief of Staff gave the targeted approach to the Syrian Arab in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus Erdogan has to increase the exit of the remaining Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last big minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or displaced already in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also CDU member.</seg>
<seg id="14">The commander asked that the German government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters. "</seg>
<seg id="15">An "witch-hunt" against Erdogan critic is held in Germany too.</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm not really sure in the last months for the first time in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">More Turks would seek asylum in Germany, mainly Kurds and opposition.</seg>
<seg id="19">The fire market as a Gülen-trailer destroys teachers and other academia the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"whoever doesn't fit and Erdogan is seated in packed suitcases, by the way the Kemalist and secular," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-nearby Foundation Dialog and education, the "World."</seg>
<seg id="21">As the newspaper reports on appeal to figures by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Turks already submitted the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany before the coup.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the reporting date June 30, this amounted to 11.386 people and thereby have been entitled to almost 29 percent of all internationally recognised (39.625).</seg>
<seg id="23">In this survey, not those who braided against war, poverty or perspectives.</seg>

<seg id="2">Funny Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get out of the summer campaign together - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood them.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Sunday dial will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays in 2021, the European Parliament voted already beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For it is not so far: summer holidays, heat and daycare campaigns - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are convinced of the fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most holidaymakers that are in the country are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not domestic, so do not choose the national day.</seg>
<seg id="8">These are practical problems: in the holiday there are helpers, posters hang, flyers, flyers, and distribute them at the end of the vote, rub only tired.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the campaign and the last day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to let the people go over to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if one can tell it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his position.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, which has been the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">The same time, as strongly Neuling AfD cut off, and what remains at the end of coalition truth remains.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age and since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous votion campaign, one sees from his major posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributed roses and chattes a little with the people, as it did already his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel to the blossoms of the African Republic.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, their "We will" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with their nickname, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the right place for election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited two chancellor Angela Merkel to grandparents, Angela Merkel is located in the Northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklands and Western Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently published in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to hear from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel listened.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the Northeast CDU is largely compensated with the usual voting rights on market places and at shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, cocades, plays only a "subordinated role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that, on the country, it is necessary to impose a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the borders of the land there is barely present.</seg>
<seg id="27">The advice of the CDU election fierce coking to his cohites is also self-larvingly: "you have to go there where people are awful, namely where people are: Dorffest, golden wedding, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is standing on the game, Sellering has called his SPD as a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, S & D Group finally reached 22 per cent behind the CDU (25) partner and just under Afro (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 election, the SPD gained still clearly with 35.6 percent (22) before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, will take the leap into the day's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue and lay their election campaigns on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign" is the President Claudia Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise there are green ballasts of trace search for national vocal burners among the holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gaek, the Svalenkandidatin, curve just with a houseboat through the mecklara lakes and finds it even beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "electoral holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-Rehabilitation: catering equipment among plywood</seg>
<seg id="2">At speed, with which the B 27 is sanctioned, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the persons responsible for the work, starting at 5.30 in the morning, beginning at 20 o'clock, there are omnipresent praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done a pretty bite," Elvira Tetzlaff explains from the Jet-gas station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south on the weekends, until the end of October everything should be finished.</seg>
<seg id="8">The removal of those responsible for the work is also praised, for example, if it comes to interior gates.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday to the south, and also the blocking of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is back, the traffic situation was relaxed in the place.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now citizens can drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The escaping traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there was some significant complaints," says S & D vice director responsible for the travel engineering of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bach's Road, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many shots were sought and rather their Navi Trust than the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What makes it possible to be mancher trucks in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limitments were not adhered, the community demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable leaps," says King, who made himself insight into the situation himself.</seg>
<seg id="17">There have been two to three per minute bleached.</seg>
<seg id="18">The speedster was on the way with 77 hours per hour in the Tempo-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved, however, it became quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small solace that for customers from Rottenburg are now open the road again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen do not hesitate to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27-refurbishment has led to their sales breaks, everyone who asks you to look back.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customers" is for other companies, for which the refurbishment had little consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even at the dealership Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "maximum slight decrease" but also provides a dream that of course "the learners" is missing. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The most strongly captured are the local road along the streets.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, proprietor of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is already threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it hard. "</seg>
<seg id="30">They were lacking the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We will be happy to be happy about each Euro.</seg>
<seg id="32">The sales increase in sales rose to "far more than 50 percent."</seg>
<seg id="33">Road fitting have thrown his operation "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He / half of his collaborators have to be released.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Mr. Jörg Schmidt said on a request of Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, the restaurant also benefited from the benefits of the location on the B 27. now they must also have the disadvantages associated with the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where was so much more generous.</seg>
<seg id="38">At all complaints, Göhner is sure that his inn will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been located since 1715, he refers to the long history of history.</seg>
<seg id="40">The fact that other regulars are now less skinned because of the complicated traffic control, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot leave it, it's nice too nice too.</seg>
<seg id="42">After the end of the renovation work at the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises of BSE and a bird flu, Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clients for the greatest crisis that has experienced its hospitality in its long-time history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Constantly being robbed in the name of terrorism in laws.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the recent attacks, the Minister of the Interior of Maizière is now a thick safety package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has an obligation to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all that?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the Compromisers.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his suggestions are politically acceptable, "says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security policy.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are not asking anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I also agree with that.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, as the Minister of Interior, he was on the results and at a "recoverable consensus" within the Coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach changed a little time before he presented his conclusions for the security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some things have been announced, announced, attached: that a new security authority should take care of using encrypted communication, is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not the fact that Germany must implement several EU directives for passenger data and weapons legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel are not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière starts a second attempt to make suggestions with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathies for terrorist groups under punishment and jihadists with double citizenship in the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"these will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man will dream up.</seg>
<seg id="18">He can still keep this for reasonable and demanding anything, what does not have any odds with the coalition partner.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas will present de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They made it partially in itself: he plans fast-term procedures for deportation and more possibilities to detention people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are brought out targeted into the country are to check out their smartphones and put social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Dulce for denied asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than so far - about such an alleged offences or to throw their papers in order to wear their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some is even inbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the imbalance of thought, for example, the question arises: what does that actually do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it isn't possible that the assassin of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people were worried about the high number of refugees concerned about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people are working deeply, must not clasp himself in election campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The insecurity is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD are therefore increasingly putting on the subject of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">During the last days, there went high between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Just a garchy battle over the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy collection of some Unions Interior Minister, in which the Ressortchefs also demand a Burka ban and a reversal of double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also tireling here to reconcile tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a conversion from the double pass he keeps nothing.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfactorily satisfy the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">They reproduce new things, be not sensible.</seg>
<seg id="42">And on a Burka prohibition, he was unconstitutional concern.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package is unconstitutional at all corners, and whether it is "reasonable" for the coalition partner, it only needs to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is some things, which could provide for war.</seg>
<seg id="45">However, the SPD also tries to profiling an internal security on the topic of internal security.</seg>

<seg id="1">Volkswagen glimpier is still coming through.</seg>
<seg id="2">In spite of the diesel version, the supplier payouts are increasing worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But not in all markets it is running around.</seg>
<seg id="4">With the response, there is a vortex for a term.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts in shipments of shipments in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite its many brands and some well-running markets, Europe's largest motorcar can demonstrate a plus, despite its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July, the core brand VW showed, particularly in Western Europe and thus charges the total sales, as announced in the Dax company.</seg>
<seg id="8">In July, the VW brand with 449100 cars sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, according to China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, the deliveries fell by almost a sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brand CEO Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July, especially to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, it has been given a purchase order in some key markets through "altered economic conditions."</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote on the exit from the EU would explain a spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S., where the emission is first escalated, another minus will be too beech.</seg>
<seg id="15">Great support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overall, the most affected house brand of Lower Saxony is moving forward to glimping through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only an extension minus 0.9 per cent is available to 3,37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">The head of the Group Fred Kappler was further suggesting a sales plan from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">In this period, Volkswagen delivered to 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide, 5.904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen manipulated with a software exhaust.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, Volkswagen calls around 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade into workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the wake of rearmament, VW reiterated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After rearmament of vehicles there is fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The car makers set up the customer according to the conversion of a "guaranteed" certificate, but I do not speak of a "guarantee" as it was on Friday in the company.</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason: legal specials.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for repainted diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This last Monday confirmed VW representatives in the Federal State Department.</seg>
<seg id="27">Out of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was confirmed that there was a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW has the resolutions of my Commission of Inquiry and the KBA Complete Works."</seg>
<seg id="29">"deviations from these are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor capacity after retrofitting have no worsening worsening, and all of the relevant vehicle values remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen himself uses the term "guarantee" but not as it was named in company.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the long term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers can come back to a workshop with an engine damage to a workshop - and this could result in the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also, in customer interest, it is important to avoid that there is any other damage caused by failure to do nothing with the Abgasshopscandal, to have an insecurity concerning possible warranty, as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore VW uses the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="3">Before you come to comment, in order to outsify him under the pseudonym non-Alleenceum shortages, this statement is derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the majority of records of records are not on a boom in millennials who want to welcome the latest news of physical objects but due to the Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have bought a plate recently, are all expected according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most likely species of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobbysers - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone at a time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I carry a modest grey suit in Soho, a modest grey suit before I stand, keep my hands hold and something to decide: "so, let's take a close look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's have a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slowly baked at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once an independent seller stayed - is there a handful of fantastic record specialist.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various males in such stores and try to estimate their ages and mind through observations.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I have sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle ages, a woman, presumably by the 20), is one day long for an meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These record plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I'm not followed by him), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy as they were selling and again items that he sold when he was young and plexed.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60ies, early 70s that appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things I thought to be too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true that those who buy plates, rather introverted and would like to spend some time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works for Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meets it meets the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, it has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced from the media, people who have heard about comeback and let themselves to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations I have led, people usually have taken away so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop such as phonica, to recognize that the stores offer a soothing community of equations.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed from the digital world and would like to move back to the stability of trusted records, from objects to call the happy Juchings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or ownership of material possessions, as a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as collectors so and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" soldered one employee in one record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people had purchased a plate over last month.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player, whom they never use while 7% of those who buy a plate no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while through an stack to Bossa Nova Compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at the sounds of the Universe (data count: three men middle ages), has noticed a "trophy-aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came out recently and said:" I don't have a turntable, but I would like to buy a radio record, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicenslains.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I didn't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">They are younger people, not older, who just clean up slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Opp, which has dedicated the record-plates almost a whole floor, has an old audience as I am clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teens and women's middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sexabsorbing pop instead of experimental jazz drinkers from the speakers - is it good to see such a diversity in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but nagged psychic traumata are badly detectable if you stand next to somebody for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes in the shop and considers the Variables which are available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's rather a shovel chair as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve a lot, so the collecting sheets are not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other way, but the beauty of plates is... it drives with a wonderful sighing.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I admit the registration of jeans-hotspot, I watch a group of young teens to meet a moment for Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter think to buy a Crop record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of sheets of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees it - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to handle them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "Disk Art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the sector, and some of them could send us to the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research results showed that the results of YouGov agree, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers, which exist in reality, record shops and Onlineforen.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety, not with the bumble through the plate stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they supposes the gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old presenter that stretches out men's middle aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected the offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live, settled down.</seg>
<seg id="3">On a court hearing these week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to dismantle 72 temporary shops within the bearing of goods from cigarettes to Energydrinks, selling hairdresser's services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisorical restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no tax would be paid, which valbard a fire and sanitation risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups sharing the court that the shops and restaurants are important because the free meals, which are offered by the nationally supported association and other groups, will not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that the temporary business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who would operate 72 temporary stores, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais Prefecture will be completely retraceable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that the food stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role as merely people living in extremely prevalent conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers have to offer.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the low-floor was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is a non-profit-profit and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as a consultation on asylum seekers for the hundreds of vulnerable needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">Over 170,000 people signed the petition to keep the kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure could be "for those children of a catastrophe involving the youngest eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrants estimated at Friday that the number of people in the jungle-camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number till now - after a steep increase of newcomers in the course of summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's Raser must be adjusted to the next generation speed measurement: in different federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightening instruments are tested, the development of speed will be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement trailer of the Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example in accidents, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or rotating bridges with a transitory route, there are often no necessary infrastructure to worry about with a stationary bladder to comply with speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">A permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days, the case data will be transmitted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded through several tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limitments as well as drive posts according to time, driving distance and vehicle class will also monitor.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the high-driven condition, one can move the trailer with every car with a trailer hook.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive British power of Great Britain at the 7-year Rugby arrived in the final hurdle at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated by 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Fiji a champion class in the handling, side steppe, descending, line of lines and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympics in any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was failed by the non-poor consolation prize of silver medal - Britain's fourth in that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament that they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back to the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of it would have been defeated a 15-man team in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a solace for a GB - but it will probably not mean that at least one Brite will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis's leader Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost with Ryan every game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This strap is weary, but the progress is astounding.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji had wonderful and left the GBS attacks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. an, when one would run in driving buses. the World Series winners went out 5-0 upwards, when Osea Colinisau was sitting in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">By another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned into.</seg>
<seg id="15">Between 12-0 and GB, hardly has the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A terrifying Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal but it has only stopped in Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute of the Jasa Veremalua, in the right corner, a touch down, and it stood at 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the reanpfiff and there was still a minute playtime... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pretendered by further weak tactics of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is like that Fiji had been born to play 7, while GB is still going to play.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is also.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to the semi-season and ended the fijianic gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua ran Tuisova after a brilliant play in Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been gone for a long time in the southern Germany, whose fans sang, Fahnen-sang and dancing on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to see the backlash approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame translated the i-dot with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff heard that Fijis hugged and GB crushing down into the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the days in the semi-final with 20-5 defeats and Britain joined South Africa in a tight semi-finalmatch from the race - British change of difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boat in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton crossed the line with an impressive track work and scored a gate under the item in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">Marcus Watson's brilliant programme, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-side teams, secured a win - and therefore the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no engine in more than in these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes up to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in her golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the rest of the meeting, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was omnipresent as her for the second Olympics in a row, for the first women in the history of the British Sports that put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all their 39.es were unencamped, which is unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes that slide over the surface with the elegance of swinging, which does not reflect the kind of triumphes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the rowing, a battalion is far from content that make up the difference and there was no one more helical than the coach who would not know that he would survive this day at all, when it was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had the cancer of bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>

<seg id="11">It would have been quite a bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could be treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of the season, what the interruption begin to have a minimum, if that is the right concept under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I needed to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">It starts so.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is already a challenge, but this makes it even greater.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a lot more than otherwise, and thus trying to process his own fears.</seg>

<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams arrived from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not rip yourself.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something funny.</seg>
<seg id="33">We did not want to work today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race whatever we did.</seg>

<seg id="2">The risky and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional cost in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial loads that threatened the industry from the green power plant are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains at the liberation of renewable energy reformation in the inventory of the so-called suitability of energy in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"I am really happy that we could finally arrive after two years of tough negotiations."</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, the European Commission initially planned to use steel manufacturers to use gases in the high furnace for electricity generation in their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry sector, the steel industry remains an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, it is now a fundamental agreement with the EU Commission to talks with competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only if the generators be replaced in the steel works, a 20 per cent of the EEG levelling will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this will not be levied in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall saluted the agreement in Germany with the EU Commission for Own Production.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thereby, the status quo has largely written the previous provision.</seg>
<seg id="13">A special meaning has the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry.</seg>

<seg id="15">"more must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">The IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt, stated on the reform of the emissions standard, too, "stated IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry has suffered under overcapacity and substantial pricing pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to intensify, when the world's largest producer, China, in view of the weakening domestic demand, threw up steel on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers cast Chinese steel concerts pricing.</seg>
<seg id="20">During this spring, the situation has a little relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">For one show, import tariffs on importer has effect, to the other have accumulated economic outlook in China.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, Spirit, health: sing the Seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp is accompanied by her whole life as a young girl in his choir as a young girl, studying music in the teaching department, and now the 78-year-old sings in a senior member.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotional and physical," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a sample she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the same way she does good in her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Singen is out of several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler by the German Senior League League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors welcome in choir and share the joy in music, describes hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular interaction, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because frequently, social and family structures are frequently solved at the age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in their choir: "to arrange and organise themselves, to learn to the other and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of collage."</seg>
<seg id="11">Sing can be stressful in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because they exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Who demands his lungs a regular basis, not as fast as the purest in the everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to get the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the German Labour Association of Senior Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common Singen had a much higher place, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or hearing of songs in older people have aroused many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By lyrics and particularly melodies, people themselves demarched themselves to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, in the singing, a special performance is required, Lenz stated.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focus on their own voice and to focus on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a very cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people, who live alone, are not only to focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition he learns through singing in choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I have long for something, I will get better and watch over me - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent, reveals Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who sounds like a tone next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, seniors have various possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sing someone from the familiar circle in a senior mood, you can easily connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer versatility across the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir, can turn right into the church or the church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior intelligence is also found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who have no access to the Internet, can ask family, friends or neighbours to ask for help in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who desire to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing the soul well and has something to liberate - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="7">"obviously, the acoustic differences between the miwing of less and strongly encouraged young males for the males are either perceptible, or not of meaning," the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH said.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" magazine.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kittens-scream differs with the emergency needs of its aid needs.</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult cat and eight cases were observed in the MHH animal husbandry.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a herd of small children playing for three minutes from the litter box and were separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">To the other, they were confronted with screams of stronger natural kittens, which were lifted.</seg>
<seg id="13">Researchers keep their results despite the low sample for aussawed.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who did not have their own offspring, did react to the screams," said Konerding.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned out faster to the loudspeaker, when this calls played the very rainy kittens.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be anborn or developed with the sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the Biologist.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby noise.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though, some studies showed that women reacted sensitive on infants, no matter whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.</seg>

<seg id="6">Before the duel of the archrivals between Istanbul and Lukas Podolfo Galatasaray Istanbul in Istanbul to the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "business as usual."</seg>
<seg id="7">Even during the suspension of exceptional cases after the overthrow in July, the government, everyday life of normal vouchers should not be affected.</seg>
<seg id="8">This does not apply to those suspected of being suspected of the movement of preacher Fethullah Gülen who is responsible for the putsch attempt.</seg>
<seg id="9">Even before the football is not done.</seg>
<seg id="10">An arrest warrant issued against the former starters Hakan Süphr issued an arrest warrant.</seg>

<seg id="31">In particular, thanks to Mario Gomez, who with 26 season of season as the South-Lig Tortozöpfennigs put the base on the 14th Title.</seg>

<seg id="20">The Thai police, however, stated that the attacks were not related to Islamist insurrection or with international terrorism.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the latest in Azendorf, the sewage fee will then be increased again, if appropriate improvement.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an excessive calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf is at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinberg (CSU) reported, was found in the approval of the budget by the Councillor Kulmbach which was discovered for these sewage systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to its legal knowledge, the market Kasendorf is obliged to operate the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, citizens as well as the commercial and industrial factories from Welschanahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg have had to grasp deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The emergency increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the Board of Directors was presented to the panel, Herbert Schmidt was the re-processing of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, overseas positions and subdiscoveries from the previous calculations should be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Based on all three sewage systems, the result is that there are relatively small sewage systems with very small sewage treatment, between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because of the low distribution base, expenses for the necessary repairs have to be gracefully developed for several thousand Euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, water sanitation is slightly declining in all three plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, the calamity period in all three facilities do not last due to the age of sanitation and repair applications in a significant extent.</seg>

<seg id="17">Schmidt: "regarding these exceptional expenses, the continued support and maintenance costs, which are to be considered in the new calendar period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which was significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made clear that at low water sanitation in the three facilities the expenses for the operation and maintenance will be achieved. "</seg>
<seg id="20">Moreover, Schmidt would have added that the market community of large entertainment costs in the sewage systems have spared over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned plants will continue to remain prefited according to view from the stone houses on the duration of Friesenbachtal, because it is not possible to extend the supply-supply of the Friesenbachtal sanitation by these systems because it is deficated facilities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat states that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is unsensibel opposite breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtration tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a piece which could be from a Roy Lichtenstein paintings.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blossoms, autonomous tools that generate more than 30 million selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All misappearances are going to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat-filters have caught in the past, in which they were accused that the app Blackface wore or white skin would be propelled as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When these week made some users a filter for some users who gave them slugs, false teeth and daunene cheeks, there was a few critics a racist cartoon by Asians - "yellowing."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether this repeated controversy has been referred to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The messages and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat thought it would have been disabled.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was a homage to Anime's characters and not as a cartoon by Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racissmus, the filter reminded of injurious clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others decided to draw the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student, written over the photos wide that the filter was "violating and mildly said."</seg>
<seg id="15">They added that "it was difficult to argue with the counter-setting of a very conflicting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellowing of jaunt has been pulled to the extreme extrem.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diet and integration of integration, from conference facilities up to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience young people - who are in the breed different than their older billers - could be rather likely to expect sensibility.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one created by Snapchats filtering a picture is created, "so much more difficult, that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu decided that the designer and engineer was working for medium to erase their Snapchat account, others required to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an interview with media and in a telephone interview she said that she contradicts that breeding-related controversy surfaced a lack of impermeability at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the great part of white, only male leadership and ended their essay with hashtag: # Delracce Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so the Chinese I-American Zhu," or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions, in which they are safe or feel comfortable to say what to say. "</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint, the Snapchat mostly left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Company doesn't publish figures to the diversity of its workforce, and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his collaborators, but according to a microphone, the company has recently set a personnel responsibility, which focuses on subordinate population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said that she will be closed their Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements, and statements made more positive before the congress," reported the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, CentCom members publicly announced that a military surrender had already begun in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second biggest city of Iraq, remains under control of Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, is as much clear." Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Congress from Kansas, in a opinion statement.</seg>

<seg id="15">The republicans called the task force to life after being alluded that analysts concerned the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during investigations.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of CentCom reports were under way by the General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>

<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the Intelligence and the Ministry of Defence welcomes the controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions about the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement that has now been made by the growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>

<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, as they did not qualify for the cades.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, where she and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, a Englishman, coach of the National Team and with that they would turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change, "said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working time in London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can wanna catch the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night Bam opened the cake in the first half of the game with a setback from the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone without win in the tournament, but the team showed herself surprisingly tough and held the player from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It carried a sprinting with a flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and drew the ball into the gate to procure the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the center of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shutout was the first of the tournament for the doorkeepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Same as Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro's events will feel constant and inevitable to a running relay between competition and pursues.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which will protect the runner for a swimmers from the wristwatch to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't stop the TV, reading a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the waiting line in Coffeshop, without hearing Simone Balaam, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is the first time at the Olympic Games and a sling of women with dimples, would certainly have been sent under these known names, which would be sent to Prime Time, when he would be a swimmers, Turner or even fish.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade there are sports that are not widely accepted: airbrush, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may rule it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make a modest arguments to my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the Trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had made his debut in Sydney, the last 16 years has perceived that many people had questioned, didn't know it is a Olympics'.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the jumping jumping competition and made a athletes until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese, and the Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong von China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on a certain side of sidewalks, partially because it sounds for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool as those for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but I'm just a bound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorously potential - the cartoonical tremor of his never-to-end collision - but also the Grazie of the gyms and diving, the two sports that essentially unifies it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means something like "jump board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Race winner jumps on a huge trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, Hreal and Saltos) before landing at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are rated at the official Olympia program according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the target, sometimes back and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They don't just chase the finish line or the output wall, but also in the TV broadcast another major goal: that of the world or Olympic records.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted striving is nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel more dazzlingly while watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is up.</seg>
<seg id="32">A moving movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prepares, seemingly heavy lifting as an astronaut, goes upward, then downwards, then effortless to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves within the distance, just the dreaming, elegant raising of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen like the competition could only be in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final customers of the women will be staged on Friday afternoon, in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, likewise at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will run the final, as part of a afternoon block at both days of 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably overlook at the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the levels of consciousness is only achieved by the Angers and the objectivity of male athletes - as the male US Turner came to the The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr Dooley expects his following air rinks, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation of protesters" in Ethiopia, Long one cubator of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia, struggling upon violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that protests were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break with us?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of western Africa with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country, and more territories were growing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people broke on streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's answer was unmerciful, according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen cruelly shot and killed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or early this year, show how security personnel are hitting young people with bumps while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now asking a temporary investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to maintain this country and it will even become more difficult," Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of International Crisis Group, is a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services collaborates closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa if at all, get much western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new drive train in Addis Ababa capital.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were put into silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were put into exile, or into prison, killed or driven into the seback of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and these do not have other options except protesting, it breaks out," said Seyst Thome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground-use to litters in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widespread election last year, the governing party and allies gained the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tension along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this crunchy, controversial line required hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden were forced to profit more or less forced to use turbulence and arm themselves again in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of provocation, after years of shortage, explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians were able to communicate via social media because cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government closed access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are located.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were gathered as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since then, the Amharas, who come from branches of countries, mainly Christian floods, in politics and the economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowlands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia are dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and the military, dominant in the intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, served until his death in an unsealed disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially tolerated to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special commissions to edit opponents and to make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing on this foundation," Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopians's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who arrived from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam come from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more blood shed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had an uproar, in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting against the elections which were apparently stolen by the government and then stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razces, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in recent months and that time of unrest fell relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pops, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal misgment of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, a amharic city, surrounded by Tigray, and hatred for the Tigray is becoming more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests in the US and other western allies bring into an autonomous position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though they recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West is definitely trying to support democracy, he doesn't want to combine his ally in a volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Mr Abdi said, "is a very thin free migration."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains that Obama's claim has been a "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding the last controversy surrounding his campaign by repeating his multiple assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the "Founder" of the Islamic State which was not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">The clarification of the questions addressed to the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he is able to communicate clear and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is also his fellowsoldier, who strive to take action during an eventful phase in protection, to explain to the original position that he couldn't have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After entering a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump appealed to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to point out President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But on Friday, Mr. Trump said, he is just being sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The contrast was contrary to the previous day where Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he meant the apology completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to save the statement on something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him, the Republican Presidential candidate really wanted to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism is down to Mr. Trump, while he tried to focus on the focus of his campaign due to random padings to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held talking about business situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their talk boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already appealed Sarkasmus to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he attracted strong criticism as he said that the Russians should crush Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he declared "Of course I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic limits in politics and then go back to ruin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test like certain messages sent from his fans as they arrive, and then appropriate" clearer "according to what the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, an communication expert, who observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is cleverly enough to keep his declarations, so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defending the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an advanced sound, since its envelopes was further declined.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a large lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is in general trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he frequently accused his critics, to distort his statements or to misunderstand its humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he stands in focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze mitts his loyal co-haul into the uncomfortable situation, irrespective of how provocant may also be his testimony.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps prominent interceers, has great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumps, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbitters, absolutely false, and so it was because he aborted the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government led by Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as an foreign minister when ISIS allowed to spread the situation in the Middle East is aggressive under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election event in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump put off his attacks on the media and threw them out on each of his words, and to be taken over against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He defied the "poor, fearful" television professionals who try to understand and said, "You can't!"</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats spun about Mr. Trumps excuse as a further proof that he is unsuitable for the presidential election.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Soap Cherie's business, invented in Summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local authorities deprived it as the last loss in a genetically modified town.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is alternation, but I still cannot believe that Census is dead, the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, then it is reinventive.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">Coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old cafes, owner and managing director of the new cafes.</seg>
<seg id="12">He began working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide funds for a new regional office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept many things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">There even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment with them.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garages such as capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natal dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café is not served more beer, but fresh juices are available.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said that he notices a staked stream of old tribal customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also pushed by prices of Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.</seg>

<seg id="34">Today Rosenthal can still get his usual order nowadays, but sometimes it changes its reins with bacon, eggs, and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he did not grope about that the soap store has taken the old business room.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie has offered a special soap for Verb with the cold brewed coffee of the coffee shops as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will go down to their offer," Rodriguez.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional, Polish inhabitants Greenpoints have also accepted the café.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As foodies, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delikes at Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de Foie gras and Maryland sea turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on this day was somewhat modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," Jane Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights, and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" was the Chinese cuisine in the United States during the brickyard in her book "97 Orchard" about living in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the Food Perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her newest co-operation, "A decent meal," which will be published on Tuesday at the Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the iron berg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, schnaucrate snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a cream energizer with Olivault, while Coe, 57, Truthahn with potato purée and vegetable salad.</seg>
<seg id="12">When debating Hacksaute, this couple found the couple for a discussion on the food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, meat loaf and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap, which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts to eat that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">COE smiled.</seg>
<seg id="18">"he must have laid down in the stomach as lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male rock workers and served fresh baked pastures for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who was sent to starving Europeans during the first World War. "a Square Meal" draws the ways to which the country went out to be not the Schlaraffenland.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time in the food for the Americans was a central, anged question," committed coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the same way, the new budgeted food: mysterious foods such as breads and casserole, were added to basic nutritional supplements, the casserole once more, "realized," "" "" "" "the delicacies could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creepy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">The flesh, which had been the centre of the American kitchen for years, became a rarely serrated luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar compounds were tried out, since a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction was precedence to taste or even healthy kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="27">While searching for the book, which included recipes, there was a court of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to the midday," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues on: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit to each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or ever since, the budget has been done - including Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943, as well as the eating habits of the country.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetary spaghetti" and the challenge to turn pose like cremum spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a celebration of historical leaks.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports of the government's answer to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-me-Cake Pops'.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant kitchen with his kitchen, he spends like the one millionth man of the world to whom he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked the continental kitchen like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in a fast-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderful realisty.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same error if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to mark a stamp with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, announcing a housekeeper with no interest in flavors, Mrs. Roosevelt took the fact that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most striking. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the types from the era of great depression, to deal with food was rejected, once the country came back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, as well as science has been applied on food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple responded to the writing of the book the eating habits of Ziegelmans mother in law better understood - for example, how they could not throw any food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of the waste of food," Coe said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the eldest of the spine is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rarely sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks usually come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and is floating with a 1 km / h in the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland haie won only 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">Same floating swims of Greenland on the ground of the North Atlantic coast, in an hour it reaches just 1.220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five meters long Tier accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this characterized by loneliness, however, seems to be a patent remedy for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the journal "Science" anyway by a Greenland who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commenting on Alexander the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, Alexander's lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the Evolutionsbiologist assumed that Greenland's sharks become rock-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence is missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually occur at the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know a little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timberpentempo seem to be more than six animals off the top of the valbard, with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make this sharks: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed the jaw knob of a young polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly, they hunt sleeping animals or patrouters on the basis of the ice cream and look at Kadaver, which torates from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland sharks, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was only 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimeter was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To obtain the age of animals, analyze it with the Carbon-14 method to relieve the sharks of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens develops already before the birth of sharks, which contained proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had much carbon-14 in the lens center.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore be in the early 1960s, when atomic bombs attempts to beat larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third tier with 220 centimeters in the third, the lentils contained a low excess of carbon-14 out of the atomic fact that it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the larger Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens centre, which caused by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493 centimetre-long Greenland was a age of 335 years while the record-shark is likely to be 392 inches old even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females will only get offspring when they are over four meters, it was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers have been able to assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of sexually mature and his old age was determined with 156 years, Greenland sharks with the proliferation of at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland-wal, put on neck a 120-year-old harpoon top, was caught up in Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Through low temperatures often the organism of the living animals live on aspars.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they attack later - and slow down.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often especially big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is much faster than its surface, inating by the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The thermal loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on it, as far as possible as many descendants" as possible, "says the evolutionary-biologist Schadventlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">An extremely large animal should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The City of Frankfurt's competition has its best opportunities in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg as the best opportunities to migrate from London to create jobs and companies.</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is highly likely that Frankfurt has benefited most of the Brexit's vote," says Michael Voigtins, Director of the Competence Bank's financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial stores can continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the so-called EU passport, the approval in the UK has so far enough.</seg>
<seg id="6">They just use big US banks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Multiple banks have already announced that jobs are held.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lobbying "Frankfurt Main Finance" anticipates a 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Frankfurt, the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), is united with responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other major authorities such as the European insurance cover EIOPA and the Risk Council ESRB.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have its headquarters, but this is less significant for the financial sector as the ECB.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the proximity to the monetary bank is important to banks as they can communicate directly with the supervising," says IW-Professor Voigtane.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Luxembourg, a large fund branch, as well as Dublin, will be worse in the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Frankfurt am clearly easier to reach the big airport.</seg>
<seg id="14">Further, the city with slightly available commercial real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Paris it is not so easy to find free-quality offices," says Voigtane.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the Seine, the rents for top-class industrial real estate will be 50 percent higher than the main one.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Frankfurt has a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a ranking of corporate consulting Mercer, the city is set to place seven, Luxembourg on No.19, Dublin at No. 33 and Paris on 37th place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if the quality of life has a question of preferences: "with its strong position as a financial location for the European domestic market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," he refuses IW.</seg>
<seg id="20">But London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Brexit's vote.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, the power relations: in London, according to the figures of Landesbank Helaba, in the end of 2015, about 144,000 people were working in the banking sector, in Frankfurt it was 62,500.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner raste last night in the coats team sprint in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the role that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eighteh. he made the legend, when he stormed to home a victory of the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed four years ago a shocking victory, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympics medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">It repeated the trick that in March at the World Championships in London despite the return of Hoys just a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this time in time as a Hindes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap which attempted to close the Kian emadi and Matt Crash.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the shrotting, which unfolds now.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won a Olympic champion, but in the qualifying rounds, the New Zealand took over in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the Duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap was just short, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner carried it out.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy of strategy turned out a large part of the transformation, by executing it in a higher speed to slow it down, and to allow it to allow the pace to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they went on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name to me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up a Olympic champion in the final round and defeats the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just amazing.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the site Kennys and Hoys, there was an indication that he deliberately led to the railway after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection of England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time was not a problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: "it feels with all the UK flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We came together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We went so badly by so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that has won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress in the past five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome for us.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of it, it is possible in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a sacred date for the British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister, was born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That's the coming of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint, which begins today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said, "If he won two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medallium competition of the day, but there were further good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Brake Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified for the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51,942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, at the Wiggins with a focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he was contested in front of the qualification, when officials called for itself to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate women's competition, continuing tomorrow and ends, avancé Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald the world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team is leaving a strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and fetched a Schar to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">An exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London were driven down the expectations for Rio.</seg>
<seg id="46">It's been playing back in the background, so the resignation of the Shane Sutton's resignation in April in the midst of Sexismus- and Mobbingulls as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks like this legendary GBS, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, again.</seg>

<seg id="1">The future of the melt of Portland, based on liquidation of the energy contract.</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of aluminium melts from Portland, Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers from workers - are on the game since the plant operator will announce the energy supply contract and thereby raise all the delivery contracts, as the supplier's energy companies can be announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step led to the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to perform the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs in the complex of Alcoa, Portland, stand on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs, direct and indirect - could be endangered at an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to Dominogens, since the melt party consumes around 10 per cent of the total electricity production of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa joined the Point Henry Schmelzei, which led to an closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of the Alcoa in Portland loses money and cracked an closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar, and last due to the electricity price for the system.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smiles with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latin, shared that it assumes that three additional owners will leave their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is located in the complex of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp have smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity by the melt adhesive," divided the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continued to have the so-called "securing transactions" that will be force in force since November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period, so they will end in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the Ability of Alcohol... the Ability of Alcohol... the hotmelt or the power supply to the melting pot cannot be affected.</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, who should have come into force from November this year, even if it is not guilty of explanation, why it came down from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts are warn due to the poor economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago complex near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said about 600 megawatts and Tomago will consume about 900 megawatts.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both plants will disappear from the market, a considerable reduction in demand on the [current market] would mean.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Hdashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted Septemberage of the U.S. Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder is and ran at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, on Thursday the latest news on their Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this Covers to tears," wrote Kendall.</seg>
<seg id="5">The unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashian's like?), which shows the entire Kardasherz-Oncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she ends the cover of her sister and ending with a classic turn: they all have a surprise level.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the result of almost every birthday party of a children's departure (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You did that we would have forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon by 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to participate in this publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September-September issue of the Vogue, a new era of theses started.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim is telling what the Vogue cover is concerned (they and their husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most popular edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference, which resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine, the output is a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the grove (615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his Cocloars is so lonely expected that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine is still leased out of the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years there were clearly more "celebrities, the model" as "models, the celebrities" are on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-Prize laureate and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 at the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even at the low probability that Mrs. Jenner is described by the magazine as the "passage model" of their generation - under the previous category, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even though it applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who are looking out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of their career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners don't like success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV story, Jennant's position was always scanned in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the other Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her "Mistakes of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cook over again, when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But riding on the Missmut seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the Vogue September issue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the true sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your floor of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters sell you pictures from their respective Paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells from her taken pictures of Cindy Crawfords's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in their leisure time they can see in the reality TV. presumably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: the Nokia communicator was released on the market 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today, the followers dominate the world - his manufacturer had a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram, and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather knocking.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in storage was at the beginning of eight megabytes, which would be sufficient for approximately two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">A iPhone is now available with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was just 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, into the business - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few Euro fans can buy lovers more in the internet, but they come from the rock time of internet era.</seg>
<seg id="11">However 20 years ago, communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a couple of months earlier in Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the West Bank format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent for that time a lot: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML-browser, even quitting slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be looked similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then found a small keyboard and a black-and-white-screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was very proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could be found in August 1996 that communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns' mobile phone card experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold at Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market today control vendors, which were all much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Being online and everywhere, this is today for a lot of people everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sold around 1.4 billion devices, Samsung and Apple are selling 555 million pieces on Samsung and Apple.</seg>
<seg id="28">The global turnover of equipment is around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">These are also the well-running business of the countless App vendors and the telecommunications market.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the meantime, around the smartphone developed a whole industry.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough for the mass market came first in early 2007, at that time, Apple has announced Steve Jobs on the Mac-World to introduce the iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a musician, a phone and a internet communications, easy to use by touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple began Apple's victory, still today the iPhone is the Group's most important product.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the watch.</seg>
<seg id="35">They finally disappeared, Blackberry got to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now we have Apple and Asian providers as Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is 20 years after its invention, a self-intellience.</seg>
<seg id="38">Today, the average of each German has 88 times a day to his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="39">"we need to learn all the smartphone even once," said Janina Ball, responsible for personnel in the Siemens executive board.</seg>

<seg id="6">For our local communities we are already 10,000 new apprentices that create 40,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as they were ahead in London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of the Heathrow extension is too large.</seg>
<seg id="8">I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will fade all on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The biflyers had injustice in 2012 and they are also lying in Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles in the crash, but Heathrow answers every question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual a infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Enlargement is an option to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion to witty growth and a legacy of skills and employment to leave the airport as well as in all GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program, from T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, until T2, which was built in the midst of the two frequented catwalks of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London Games were a great success for UK and I am confident that Heathrow's extension will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time that we expand this Olympic spirit and extend our future business as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs in which England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">For businesses that make money with Onlineages money come out according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to avoid ad blockers, a "Katz- and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block displays on his desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blogger, in which it was shared that users could update their filters in the program to lock again advertising in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook tells that his desktoppage would change the coating on his advertisements to make it beat the recognition of it which is part of the page advertising to make it harder.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a bloc post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind Hin-and-Her struggle between the pointing an open source community and converters already exists since the invention of advertisers in progress," and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest enterprises in social media has launched in the struggle is a powerful indication, as worrying into the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study published last year from Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people are watching scorements; almost four times so much in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion users active users who access Facebook through their mobile end devices, handypublicity makes up 84 percent of advertising revenue.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company has no effect on display block devices on desktop PCs, since mobile ad block does not have an effect on Facebooks mobile app for the social network and Instagram, shared a speaker.</seg>
<seg id="11">Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large share of revenues, so that Facebook is the investment of such a pacemaker as worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Tuesday, Facebook tells us that there would be an "advertisements prizepool," to facilitate the people more control over them.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Facebook says that Adblocks would be worrying new filters, because they would not block any content on the side, which are no advertising.</seg>
<seg id="14">"for the users there is no positive experience, therefore, we plan to address the problem," said a spokesman of Facebook in an e-mail message.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indicators are a dumb means, why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Preferences, to put more control into the hands of people.</seg>

<seg id="11">Was a clash avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">That is something of the prosecutor's attorney, "said Hofstetter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not being moved to responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - there was a person in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the motorists have not to go out that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night on the highway, as it was in the newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, probably once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms, similar to those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if Venus could have been identified with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once desdlike conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously noted that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, penetrated atmosphere and nevertheless turned on slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry places than de earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected against much more evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was around 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow shift of Venus will expire their day's side almost two months," explained GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that works like an umbrella to remove the surface from a large part of solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The results are average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution of evolution ever since.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was likely to be inhabitable, Venus -- fell too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans are evaporated and their water vapor was burnt away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their Hydrogen revolted only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus, that as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler World space scopes was helped to collect the most complete catalog of rotational rates among the stars of the starboard of Pleyades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers to understand why stars are related to different rates, as well as in which context the rotational periods are available with planetary controls.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through the comparing of our results with other stars, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system, Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The starboard of the Pleyades is 445 light years away from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak margins, these mature stars drive large quantities from starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because these winds are travelling through the fields of magnetic fields, they have a brake effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is shaken, its rotational rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation of each star, taking the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- as sunglasses - recognizes.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are more than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, although larger stars are swiftable pirouettes than smaller.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the" Ballet "of the Pleyades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas fast fans tend to be, very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the starboard of the Pleyades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the starring of the Pleyades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still much ahead of us what we like to learn more about how, when and why stars are slow down their rotations and so to say their "dance shoes."</seg>

<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say 'Goodbye' to both ', declared the 14-time all-star game participants of major league baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">In three times Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the Yankees World Series.</seg>
<seg id="7">Its signature under a tenth deal has been ratified by 27 million US dollars annually since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the contrast on December 31, 2017 he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a player, Rodriguez paid long time with performance.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 Homerus, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Navers (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 he managed to have some milestones.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive dopingsample, weight lifter can not start Adrian Zielinsky from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - Olympic Games 2016 will be overshadowed by the first official dates.</seg>
<seg id="4">An experienced Athlettering would have been almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first official dates of the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games have become known before the seventh competition event.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimming pool in Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle in Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinsky have been positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the leathletical athletics competitions this news will come to the accident.</seg>
<seg id="7">For Chen last Sunday the diuretics has been demonstrated by hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masked means for doping subcutaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International SportCourt CAS confirmed its departure from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18 year old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly, just around 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have to participate in the demonstrations over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Chen has requested the opening of the B-Trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">The national association took the matter "very seriously and demands Chen full co-operation with the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a message: "we will work together with the International SportCourt CAS and will accept the judgement."</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history is no longer the IOC, but the CAS responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio seep the news about the positive sample at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went to the offensive by himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is innocent, "the only explanation could be a dietary supplement," explained the athlete's athlete.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said to deal with the banned substance around the EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa was given provisional release, according to BNT, the B-trial is also already positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow prompted criticism of the athlete's athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the athletes do not pull the proper slaughtering," he said, "We Bulgarians under observation, as many have been expelled."</seg>
<seg id="21">Thus, approximately every weightlifter can not participate in the chronically dopinged nation in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday also the case "Adrian Zielinsky," known as his brother Tomasz, was tested positive for three days earlier on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both denounces the ingestion, but they are not allowed to start up to 94 kg in class.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of athletes, in particular, Danekowa is another serious blow for the reputation of the total sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association had submitted the entire Russian crew to an exception due to systematic dopings to start the start, even in Rio, numerous bad news will also be produced in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the case of swimming-sport, in China, too, the former confrontation between the athletes were gathered.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datasheets: so perfide erpresses chacker your ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of contact malware can currently rely on targeted companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware-defense specialists in North America, UK and Germany 40 percent of surveyed companies surveyed have at least once, some multiple victims of a attack with the presser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies had already been the goal of a Ransomo-press.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims paid willingly provided by the perpetrators required to take advantage of the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialise in their empress software according to the observations by Malwarebytes to attack in company network.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential savings are considerably higher than in private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a scary fast evolution of the malware software," says Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the painters were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the pressing software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private use was the target, but the change to corporate attacking took place over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware is working according to a simple pattern: once active upon the computer of an optional, it is looking for unlong modified files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the receivables of the discretion.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims need money - usually in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin - point.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo-database is based on the game, it is about firms for sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage fails, if a Ransomo suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies reported revenues losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to run business activities, in case of a case people were in danger of danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany many hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients could be threatened with loss of ambulances.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: pay not that it promotes only the problem," says Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of the standstill.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers turn again, and attempt to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the safety researcher of F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the presbyists and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain their sacrifices by chat as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free access web sites, or decrypt for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are saved after payments by a few hundred euros, companies must pay a part hard, and pay five digits of sums to get their data unturnkey.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of potentially high and relatively risolly profits from the Ransomware discretion the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, however, is that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware infection in the form of a software package to the actual Erpresser.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits were created by making malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"delivery includes a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The claimer then search for further hackers, to spread the newly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, one logged in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and manager another way to install the software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is done per inferred calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals apply to dissemination," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ransomo's risk is now known for many companies that make their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT-developers in the malwary poll depend on how to defend Ransomware using file-Back-ups and Scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone no sufficient threat to successful recovery is more, the perpetrators instead, with the release of sensitive data such as some customer lists or price lists," says Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential of damage, depending on the type of data, is higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators also could completely take new goals on the Internet of things on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerconference Dcon demonstrated safety researchers, as they were able to control a thermostat with the Internet connected thermostat.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the releasing of a kind blocked heating could definitely be a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators will then block a whole production line instead of heating in a factory, Ransomware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack it all: a little SUV, a little Coupé, and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sound pretty unloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, has actually proved very flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and in the rear, no place works closely.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well processed and make pleasant, only the cockpit-top drops off there anything.</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile as comparable vehicles, the HR-V is the storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l in high-quality and 1026 l in folded back-rests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magically, as it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded as Kinosessel's seat and offer a storage space that is 1,24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the load-height with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel engine delivers 88 kW / 120 hp, the HR-V accelerates very powerful thanks to the torque value of up to 300 Nm.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should set out a little quieter out of his job.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine variant: a 1.5-liter gasoline unit with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering is likely to be a bit more likely.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment has no wishes to be desired in the tested top version "Executive."</seg>
<seg id="19">The City-Notary assistant (operates until speed 32), the collision warning system and the track assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision was irritated sometimes because he evaluated many obstacles as a "organizing objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote control assistant is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed regulators react to the traffic signs and drosselt when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App-Integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore something awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel is in order.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest so much, the petrol engine will receive 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro-6 emission standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday-day car.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you will be wandering around, at night you wake up hours up, in the morning long before bedbugs are not thinking of sleep anymore.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is all others as relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, there is no problems with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep sleeping disorders and over ten percent do not find their sleep frequent or permanently respawn.</seg>
<seg id="5">How far sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many causes of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleeve and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what we understand under it is the insomite, that is, therefore, an entry and sleepless disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just going to sleep well, many people find out as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagner's co-member of the German household association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is behind organic, psychological, or behavioural factors, but also medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">No rare is the disorder's sleep expression of a different disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is frequent in case of depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are in one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes every two to three hours and starts to meditate about everyday problems and -care for greetings, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should people sleep with sleep problems to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who should not sleep well over a month period of at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day should consult a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, exhausted, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like gastric or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve the sleep problem, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, or drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and more for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Situated in Germany, there are scarcely hardly points out in Germany, stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of Interdisciplinary Sleepers at the Charité University Clinic in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That's why you should contact sleeping difficulties first at the doctor advising that Weeß is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with investigations, if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what has happened?</seg>
<seg id="26">For an investigation in the sleeping laboratory, an example of snoring with respiratory failure, at bedtime, or if you do not find the cause of a sleepless disorder.</seg>
<seg id="27">We don't have to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"just make no nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After widocks one goes into bed for his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nasal goggles, a chest strap and a feelight on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is also characterized by a camera on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws, to which one can make for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß is on: regular sleeping and rising time, not too long in bed, not to sleep on the day, do not watch TV to sleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch - then you start to calculate immediately, and that's quite and not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altbuilt, a few linseed backpacks, in between still a rest of piling stone: the Rigid street in Berlin-Friedrichshain operates at first glance not yet, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of town.</seg>
<seg id="2">Go along the street from the east to the west, one comes to places, a refreshed kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone has spotted "ugly!" to the façade of a grey house. "</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl that will soon be demolished, it will be built: until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," as the responsible property company Friedrichshain calls, is illustrated by combustible cars in the last few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was busy, meanwhile the inhabitants have lease income, but on the ground floor, however, rooms are still occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin Innensator Henkel had been several times for a tough prediction of police against the project by the beginning of the year against the project "No-Go-Zone" for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the cadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three club cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated building workers on behalf of unknown house owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal, and one day later police and construction workers led among the cheers of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street seems peacefully: parents go with children, people sit on pavement at the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertained in late late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin objects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left hand is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiev's Kiez, and Jana *, who are three children here, are primarily generously driven by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the bonding projects, they share concern with worrying and gentlfication.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wish to give a majority of police officers in front of vandalon the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin Innensator and the police open between house owners and their neighbours, does not exist so obviously.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "neighborhood, which also has a lower average risk compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">The house occupied and the only native residential projects belong to the Kiev family: many houses were occupied by the former East Germany, including nearly the entire Main Street, close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under large police officers in a real road-battle, many of the projects were legalised in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly becoming the magnets for tourists and voting liner from around the world: with them now people are share from the GDR's time and former home-house places.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also makes itself noticeable in the rallies who have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigs are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognize them on the designed discs, or freshly painted facades, which were being thrown with coloured bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year as often with the words "Left-Independent Violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for that not all neighbours can view it as a problem, might be that it is not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are doing property damage, which tends to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence is concerned, they are aided: people in the 94 are their neighbours that were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars admit it right in the Rigaer last longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect of architect, their street is not a criminal case, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, live together on the street and gets more than one another."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously moved into the rigging road - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that the people have returned its way: from the police, the politics and the media, which all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by characterless new buildings in former construction gaps that fortify the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are all condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - here, rather people who are not so good," says it.</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction I absolutely not have guatheim."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do when someone hears it?</seg>
<seg id="36">It relies on all sides frustration, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For drafts using colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin objects and the left-scene belonged to a pine.</seg>
<seg id="38">Anyone who moves, should be aware of it - just like someone who walks in a pub quarter but difficult to complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">Everybody with first names presented, have asked, not to be called with their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="9">We are looking for an administrative compassionate with a talent for languages and people, connected with a longstanding experience in the field of social work, even a jealous womilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Especially it is about organization, work with people on site and behind the scenes, as well as network management.</seg>

<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult since some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work until now, you have to rely on Private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, the hostile apartments must be adjusted, as it is so beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do not do profit, and motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">It does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">Day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and Customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a rigorous-feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also jump here administration and honorary posts.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long term of procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain the refugees that it will just take it and take time to aduct them, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who sometimes feels the feeling of developing, he could not be able to work in Urbach, you should not work and be unprofitable, who will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases there is, however, say customer honestly, "people with whom nothing goes." work by Deuschle and Customer may always be motivating others to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth job."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do both of them have fear of radicalization, even in a small church such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">No, "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents may be subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks have come complete them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So major and honorary posts need to look out on site and in the region to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">Yet they always have in the background that soon a new impact of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, the policy discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived there, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, this would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes clear that the Urbacher has even been utilized to fully integrate all of the people's sensible people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are about 100 persons, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, one must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
