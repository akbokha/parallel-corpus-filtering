Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendship .
the two wanted to implement the international agreement as well as Tehran to speak with dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing activities in the Middle East .
however , at the meeting , there should be a conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been anxi@@ ous for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuing settlement of settlement of Israel to give the imp@@ lications of the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama , in order to deal with the Iranian nuclear program , wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , Netanyahu had kept the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the U.S. Congress to have been implic@@ ated as a aff@@ r@@ ont to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had refused to enter the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , his girl@@ friend said to have shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon prayed , with a somewhat ch@@ itt@@ led voice of the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officers had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; but still live and possibly be excited , and he said that the relatives of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss and a handwritten note taken on a white block , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I loved it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved Me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that lamb , who travelled into two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , submitted even 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was killed and killed by the police according to the police .
Delta State University Poli@@ kat@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said , Lamb took the disa@@ strous emergency call back after this .
until the end of the day there was another death : the lamb had taken life when police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
a day after shooting in the University , students and teachers are forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to pro@@ claim a picture of what lamb is motivated .
the details published by the agencies at the two ends of the State for details , such as those who knew him , told them to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly even difficult teachers .
students said that they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where he died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmidt himself had mentioned lamb in a written book , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose profess@@ ors includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some clim@@ bs to problem@@ atic behavior .
a student in Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised lamb , said that he also seemed a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had told us at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any problem for health reasons .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the university would signi@@ fy that the promotion , for the Lamb had worked so hard for him , would no guarantee for an automatic way to claim as Assistant Professor .
all university president William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are some questions , the Lamb is no longer able to answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later , when he drove back to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as again .
before he was arrested , he killed self with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile to the south of his parents &quot; town on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was running in the interven@@ ing journey .
it was not immediately clear why we went to the house , but Johnson said they knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb opened his work at the university , which has more than 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants , and taught in ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs called him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 &amp; lamb was 20 when they met together with shared friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her guitar .
he was the morning of women at the time .
all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
lamb and p@@ ad@@ get were apparently some time together .
in the emergency call , Lamb , &quot; I put my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house which is ad@@ ored to a Ba@@ you at G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ un@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends left and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never hit me , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that lamb had been interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ p@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up for both years on a summer fair .
later they played together the one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter is writing and sings their own music .
Pr@@ un@@ iss was a nurse that worked online for several companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak shu@@ ffle in the vicinity of G@@ auti@@ er , said that he finished lamb and p@@ iss night out on September 5 for the last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ious finale .
there was no evidence that something was not right .
he just said , &quot; simply a lucky pair , &quot; he said .
we were on stor@@ ks and j@@ est@@ ing together .
I mean , they both had a good sense for j@@ est@@ ing .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester program and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on the Tuesday evening , some 900 people attended the Delta State University , including teachers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle @-@ light commemorative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the wake @-@ up , while the university entrance &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; sang .
the classes are resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to rev@@ iled by the police that lamb had shot yesterday when he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ p@@ iss already described as his wife , but there is no indication of that these two have ever been married .

Michael J. Fox News about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater to the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes very clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for the forth@@ coming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a sim@@ ulated guest and a tail @-@ length of being removed with the prin@@ cess of Wales at a date .

UN leader says , there is no military solution in Syria
ban Ki @-@ moon says , Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says , its response to Russia increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years &quot; conflict , and more weapons will be mer@@ ing violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .

8 fra@@ ying values indicate that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have attempted to brand it as a flop .
others tried it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republican attempt to try Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper r@@ ots with p@@ olls down@@ ward , it didn &apos;t work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range and some begin to seriously ask themselves what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate of real estate .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
nobody said that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts acc@@ entu@@ ate that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys were handed in to the asc@@ ending Herman Pur@@ suit , one of whom only won a state in the nomin@@ ating process .
and there are many reasons to fight it in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative business Group Club for Growth can now recognize the sever@@ ance of Tr@@ um@@ ps and start to bring their bu@@ ck to overthrow him .
here are some current res@@ oun@@ ding values that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Belie@@ fs have turned by 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ ature in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw real estate gu@@ l .
until mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have negative opinions .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa last week noticed that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good view of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters were happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CNN pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they would &quot; be angry , &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son puts about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent , they would be &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same above Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; stum@@ ble &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump so@@ aked for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive papers , 52 percent of all rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul says the correct temper@@ ament to a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 % think that he does not have the personality , in order to effectively implement his function , and nearly six out of 10 independent professionals say that his temper@@ ament was not p@@ itted to the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get acc@@ ust@@ omed to the idea .
when they set up their money @-@ chickens , Republican elec@@ torate Tr@@ ump is real .
if you are asked who will win the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee at the earliest week , CNN / OR@@ C will say four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time , when four of ten ended up their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
but it shows that a large number of GO@@ P voters will look plau@@ sible milit@@ arily .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tr@@ ump proposes almost everyone .
some experts have pointed out that the split box probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is diff@@ us@@ ely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head racing between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , tr@@ ump is harvested .
he left Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , just Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head racing with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who suggests it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take entrepren@@ eur 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head racing .
a suc@@ cin@@ ct majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have made their opinion .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a bit more than half of voters that support Tr@@ ump will say they have received their voices .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never to change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change other candidates .
nevertheless Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ der , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but elec@@ tors who have formed their mind is twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with te@@ aser on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign led by immigrants from Mexico &quot; whom he called &quot; rap@@ ist , &quot; the Immig@@ ration and Angel@@ ika is in the public dis@@ course until 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic ac@@ re pressure of Tr@@ ump @-@ American is fully remote controlled by the Republican Party and the re @-@ orient@@ eering efforts are dam@@ aging .
but after the new ABC / post survey conducted Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump on issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration falling down in the lim@@ el@@ ight , it seems to do Donald Tr@@ ump , too .
the fru@@ stration across the government clim@@ bs to new high@@ s .
with Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , more than half of Republican elec@@ tors support from Republican elec@@ tors , especially by its out@@ si@@ der status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience .
and they are also li@@ vi@@ d in Washington .
a survey carried out by the Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent , &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five Exclu@@ sive neighbor@@ hoods in Germany
here in the plan@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg path is the most expensive residence - overlooking the North Sea cloud .
in the street one square meter of a roof apartment is about 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which particular areas costs a square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top residential districts , one of the price comes before .
the real estate provider angel &amp; company has published a ranking on the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of nothing - per square meter , mind you mind .
but good , who can afford to afford ...
Inci@@ dentally , Munich is not as an exception here at the fore@@ front .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start@@ up thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two go@@ al@@ sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a race .

they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance , without spar@@ kle .
Pi@@ raeus had won his most recent six home games in the Premiere League , among them prestigious clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled across .
but the Bayern , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victims .

in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for a eliminated Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
it arrived late to Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , he was still standing by El@@ f@@ meters .

anyone smo@@ kes , has an increased risk of losing teeth
he who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that &apos;s a way of Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study close .
the good news : with short@@ age , the risk falls quickly .
smoking have an increased risk of risk of losing their teeth early .
the long @-@ term study of an international research teams , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) , went into Potsdam .
compared to qu@@ itting smoking they lay the risk of losing their teeth in early times , in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .

for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the link between smoking and dental treatment therefore go back to frequent g@@ ing@@ itis in smokers .
do not clari@@ fied , however , smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who heard from smoking , however , could reduce their risk within short time , the researchers have written in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could last but last ten years until the endang@@ ering was back on the level of qu@@ itting smoking , first aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .

EU Commission proposes the TT@@ IP new trial in dispute over TT@@ IP
for the dispute over the trans@@ atl@@ antic trade agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ral tribunal .
the controversial private protective equipment for disp@@ utes between concert and states are therefore intended to be replaced by a transparent system which comp@@ lies with significantly more traditional dishes in its operation .
&quot; we want to submit a system to trust the citizen , &quot; explained the Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström when she started her conception .
the Swe@@ din had to bring the proposal for a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade negotiations with the United States .
the German government announced support .
through TT@@ IP , the largest free trade zone in the world will arise with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings cont@@ ested that the EU states and the U.S. will jointly choose independent judges for a new plant in the country .
they shall be part of the EU , the United States , and third countries .
is fore@@ seen for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to up@@ lift up objec@@ tions .
so far , the dispute between refer@@ ees and refer@@ ee were not agreed to agree , there was no objec@@ tion against their judgments .
in the discussion of recent months we have become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice did not trust , commented at Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , they are planning to perform an international investment decision .
there could be clari@@ fied disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU states there , for example .
the investor @-@ state bit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) was regarded as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against the TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ers are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel ports , for the company damage the tax@@ pay@@ ers out of tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws or cut down environmental and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations like Camp@@ act signed the proposal of the European Commission as in@@ adequate .
it was critic@@ ised for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) in particular for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada .
in contrast , the German economic secretary of Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) demonstrated the plans as a great step forward .
taking into consideration substantial points to reform essential points , the Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration would be from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business Division Business@@ Europe warned against restri@@ ct the business opportunities of business by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it was called .
when the talks on the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ l@@ antic Trade and Investment Partnership ) will be completed , the negotiations will continue un@@ clear .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed so far with the USA .
originally , a framework for this agreement should already be at the end of this year .

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns in the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has made a difference in the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire with the Prime Minister .
the new Socialist leader , Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , should put his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fre@@ igh@@ s and saw David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ lob@@ n will take up lunch for the first of his six pre@@ defined questions , whereby his performance of the media is probably inspec@@ ted by the media and the Labour MPs from the area .
he demanded &quot; fewer Theatre and More Fac@@ ts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p several sessions to give her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Gui@@ delines , as she comes to a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ let as a member of his speech at the TU@@ C Conference on Tuesday .
meanwhile the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the singing of the National hy@@ m@@ ne during a commem@@ oration ceremony of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and is at the heart of several cover pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention ...
a speaker of Mr Cor@@ lob@@ n said he had stood &quot; respec@@ tful st@@ illness &quot; and he recognized the &quot; Hel@@ pen@@ ick of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told in the BBC two News@@ night programme that he advised the Labour Party to sing the National hy@@ mn , &quot; ir@@ respective of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of the shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns top team , and they are calling for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Assembly supported him as leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political tensions are st@@ icking to Labour &quot; within Labour &quot; and after Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the restriction .
Mr Cor@@ lob@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference , that Labour has to make changes to the entire idea of a limitation total .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pensions , Mr Smith said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that they have only to cut against the government &apos;s plans , to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ lob@@ n is the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , leader of T@@ ory leader , has since passed over the last decade on the Disp@@ atch @-@ Box in parliament .
the Labour Party , promised with a different policy approach , says that he has dealt with &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas on Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 ideas .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the temporary home of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ational , and that he will under@@ go both &quot; impact ness &quot; and the spreading with resistance , and has instead made a serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ lob@@ n said Angela Eagle , who is bound to represent the shadow @-@ economic ship if he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is on the road outside .
he also brought the idea in conversation , that other colleagues sometimes seize the word , and that he had addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was able to remove himself from politics in style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater , &quot; often associated with the Minister of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he admitted that he has failed .
since it was broadcast on television first in 1990 , Fra@@ is with Prime Minister , as the most important bar@@ omet@@ re of a leader and his position among the par@@ liament@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that they had become a caric@@ ature and require a far reaching reforms .

Peg@@ ida poster brings Lebanon to the potato @-@ ön@@ er @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
there is both - and in the Kartoffel@@ keller , developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ al owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
inspired by the expression &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the movement of the movement , hay potato and meat put together on a s@@ ke@@ wer .
the idea brought him a poster with a Peg@@ gy party with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen at random on TV .
since then in his shop , a barbecue s@@ ke@@ wer that is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
Lebanese have meanwhile arrived in the patent department in Munich .
here it has been protected as a utility since , according to the Authority .
as much meat and how much potatoes of the s@@ ke@@ wers are , al@@ hay will therefore not be betra@@ yed .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds himself .
culinary international understanding also increases too well with its customers .
Met@@ cash kicks off Land par@@ eness Camp@@ a@@ ign for the fight against al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
Met@@ cash attempts to protect the IG@@ A branches in front of a Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has started a ground@@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is opening the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets expand their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A through ma@@ instream media and marketing about social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A distributor and suppliers can jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturers ple@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distri@@ butes samples and shop@@ keeper who sell tickets for the South Australian soccer league to your loyal customer .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will be publishing more details of his defence strategy on 29 September when whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers of food , alcohol and devices lead to the annual investors strategy .
it is much on the game because South Australia and Western Australia generates nearly 30 % of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shops and higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious , provincial , and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stanley is that Al@@ di will take five percent of the food market for twelve months after opening his first markets in these two states and will take out all existing actors , but mainly independent individual tra@@ ders .
according to a report published this week , the analysts Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley was estimated to lose 360 million sales revenue per year and $ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has over 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in the food and grocery store and the quantities on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed @-@ based storage could cost Met@@ cash around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash flows market share in eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan had discovered that IG@@ A buyers are the most tre@@ pon@@ ent .
Morgan Stanley is taking action that met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager , Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , was the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , on a business day in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will likely van@@ ish within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash started in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has gone down from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s Food and food trade , which has fallen around 1,200 IG@@ A @-@ reta@@ iler , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting its operating debt reduction in turnover and mar@@ gins .
whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers , however , will be investing more than 150 million $ in order to attack selling prices with Col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and improve IG@@ A retailers in improving their stores due to fast growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s major managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the pricing and shop utilities are being fin@@ ed and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association , Steve He@@ aly .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behavior .
Than@@ asi co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damages , &quot; in the recent storm on Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves recognition by the President of the Australian tennis Federation , Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
the younger of the talented du@@ os , the younger of the talented du@@ os , is always referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA , among the Montreal Masters at the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati , Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice through the refer@@ ee , whereby Harrison had called &apos; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to propose that and I should propose the child . &quot;
while he was last seen , he was crushed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp@@ f had s@@ acked a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gas , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is at present in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single @-@ finals at the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I aw@@ ned myself , is the fact that after my view , Than@@ asi was a little over the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken up a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a var@@ iet to the US Open , but he is not the first player who has made a bat of fru@@ strations for himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved very well into the US Open , even amongst the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so forth , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little bit .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he never worked as a problem with the other players he is training hard , he is well in the form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ved it to be judged according to his own publisher .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into consideration that the decision on Friday begins , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long lasting firm to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we want the team completely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ versy around &#91; C@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe Nick has made a quick way to what people such as Feder@@ er and Murray are pointed out . he is rising in the eyes of the public but we try to support him , but we try to think him the consequences of his work , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , close to the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and spread the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the party that tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim to stop the state of migrants .
chaos followed on the border as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land of Serbian and indig@@ nation with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled from the violence were astonished at an unknown time in a country strip along the street between the two controls of the states and built their tents , and settled there .
but fru@@ strations went on board .
as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , migrants arrested the fron@@ ti@@ ers . &quot; and cried out against the Hungarian dep@@ loy@@ ments to the Hungarian Police .
some refused to protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; that migrants should be sent back from Hungary , more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral intervention .
there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serb border ended a day after the 28 @-@ nation @-@ block with no united immigration policy in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 40.000 people who had sought refuge in shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or until the end of the year , an agreement would be that the EU states would continue to accommodate another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary , however , did not give his hopes for an early action of Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency service on Tuesday , held on Tuesday , issued more powers to overcome the crisis , so that they could accelerate the streets and asylum seek@@ ers .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also had the construction of a bar@@ bed wire to the border of Romania , to stop the state of migrants through the country - after it had ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisoners in the competition run the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a number of people of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban only insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not people of war , which have a strong view to the other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall z@@ a@@ us to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also put up pen@@ alties for the condem@@ ning traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; as a result of the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government proclaimed the state of emergency , &quot; said government speaker Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected for next week , but are rep@@ uted by Associ@@ ated Press on the limit of heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security adviser to Or@@ ban , said authorities 45 people attemp@@ ting to cross the fron@@ tier , 15 others were dr@@ illed into the country even deeper .
they come over by damage the fence , they are now in custody and are accused of crimes perpet@@ rated by the new laws .
authorities are able to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos was surrounded by the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to implement the data of people and put a crowd in order to push yourself there .
about 20 succeeded to arrive , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead to Ber@@ nie S@@ ander in a national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continue to hold a double @-@ digit lead in democratic race to nom@@ ination at national level , but sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders win its face to the ground .
Clinton now has support of 47 percent of the democratic voters for the previous sel@@ ections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is at second , with 27 percent increase ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced his presidential election , receives support from 15 percent of democratic voters for the presidential election .
more than five months before the start of the preliminary election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion stands , which Can@@ didates will support them .
but Clin@@ t &apos;s supporters are more stable than one of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups during S@@ anders had gained some profits .
Clinton keeps a big advantage in women and the middle , but these jumps have decreased .
your support for men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders can only return with 5 points .
in 50 years , Clinton &apos;s benefit with democratic voters being lost , and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton had another advantage in the older elec@@ tors .
last month , Clinton used himself to lead with double @-@ digit advantage over the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the nationwide referendum would say that they would be supported by che@@ ers Clinton if she was nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with a few rights and 15 percent would only support them because they are the can@@ did@@ acy .
they would not support six percent .
maybe Clinton &apos;s current supporters can not be thr@@ illed , especially by her .
the views are stronger with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her enthusi@@ ast@@ ically .
while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they must support Clinton with enthusiasm , they say less Republican elec@@ tors above the leading candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 per cent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters in an open question is asked why they want the can@@ did@@ acy is the common@@ est question that she has the right experience ( 16 per cent ) followed by the opinion that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement with the handling of problems and voters are also quoted .
since Vice President casts a potential for the presidential election into the Wa@@ ag@@ ger , 57 percent of democratic voters will see him in the race - although one third believes it should not do it .
when democratic voters are asked of the sel@@ ections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is on top .
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far before S@@ anders .
decides to ab@@ dic@@ ate not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead raises 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race for 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters will see Clinton as Kan@@ di@@ dat@@ in with the best chance of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen by 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by distance a second at that measuring , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; chosen &quot; has risen .
yet , with the question about what is more important in one candidate , DRC voters call questions about the voters .
similar to last month , no single democr@@ at@@ y candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate is known as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate , or potential candidates provide good results with some important features in voters for the party &apos;s sel@@ ections .
maj@@ orities , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are both honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
in the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the lead in hon@@ esty while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say the above S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinions of him .
Democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters does not have any opinion from S@@ anders .
because asking for Hillary Clinton &apos;s acceptance of a personal email address and server session during the term as Secretary of State , most of the Democratic voters are pleased with their statement of the matter and say that their opinions has not affected their opinions .
but there is another story in the American public .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most of the Americans say that the email contro@@ versy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , while 36 percent said that their opinion is wor@@ sen@@ ed from her .
it is mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , over six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy of its party , it will continue to have a problem for it among registered voters . only 32 percent do they see than honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voting members don &apos;t hold them for honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the voters are subject to tr@@ ump as non @-@ honest and non @-@ tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will receive good notes of guidance .
out of the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush hosts the best in hon@@ esty .

Ben Car@@ son moves near to a survey conducted by Donald Tr@@ ump on national survey
Ben Car@@ son is a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art survey conducted by C@@ BS News / New York Times behind Donald Tr@@ ump
on the two candidates , half of the voters pay half of the voters in the new survey , and others are losing moment@@ ous .
Republican voters also support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . support growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate in the past month to 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also indicated that Car@@ son sur@@ passes well in demo@@ graphic groups and is sur@@ passing thr@@ ump among Republican elec@@ tors .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ governor John Kas@@ ich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins , Governor Scott Walker , who fell the deepest , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida governor Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at the third place with 6 % .
the error @-@ margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son has entered the p@@ olls - it ends 19 % support with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view to the Car@@ son Rising , Tr@@ ump found some side tra@@ verses for the former neuro@@ surgery , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ um@@ ps faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on last Saturday during a campaign show in Io@@ wa .
pleasant pool temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
and when peak values are measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean sea is enough to take a trip to the Mediterranean .
a dip in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
some more than 18 degrees does not go to the sea : the water has a maximum of 18 degrees in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .

five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened by the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student at a ha@@ ik@@ an@@ ant rit@@ ual student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ al@@ suit filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood called Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during one entry of dedication while in September 2013 , giving up his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
civil servants said that it was stra@@ ined with associated eyes with a 30 pound kn@@ ru@@ ck@@ sack full of sand , and it was r@@ att@@ ened , while trying to finish the frozen field on a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g finally mour@@ ned over headache , so he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i delta P@@ si bro@@ therhood are not calling the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
they had the time to change your stuff against D@@ eng@@ s , his symptoms of goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ kat@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide , and presented the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood , as well as Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ kat@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has repeatedly been added with bl@@ unt force injuries on head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student , since 1970 , dies to the Sch@@ ik@@ anen until 1970 , he said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer and the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a declaration .
brothers and their members need to be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe , issued an indictment for murder of third @-@ degree order for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with pr@@ un@@ ting attacks and education against a criminal association .
&quot; we don &apos;t only want to make the involved persons responsible , but if there is an organization that has officially sanc@@ tion@@ ed or un@@ officially - this , we will also recall that , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest
an interest rate increase , and the house will hit the flan@@ ks , and return for bonds , and the economy will lead to recession .
we know this .
what we do not know , how long will it take and how long it is to stop .
in particular , the history for the economy provides only minor guidance for the exp@@ iry date .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising the interest rates is often , even if not always , a factor in the economy as the economy and financial investments react .
therefore representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have strongly emphas@@ ized that investors should not focus on it whenever they begin to increase the interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , many variables are playing a role .
in the end , market participants could notice that absolute excitement is possibly exagger@@ ated by the interest rate of interest .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ it@@ ably interpreted &quot; a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message of clients .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of the US interest on normal heights , but still on low level to increase seis@@ mic shock , to which many seem to be feared .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a view based on historical trends , as some areas of the economy could react :
as seen in the market last month , the advance of interest rate hike with interest rate can make for a while .
once the increase hits , the effect is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tendency to increase current revenue from 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts predic@@ t in a recent study , what happens according to the profits of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 per cent - on the way to the rate of interest , fairly flat in the 250 days later ( average profit of 2.6 % ) , then back to normal conditions , the Bob D@@ oll , boss Cr@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s 2009 .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks will later occur at the top @-@ up cycle and the return is to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases often .
in current case , F@@ ed confron@@ ts with some conditions that could not exist before and that could accelerate the recession .
it is extremely notable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , with the 118 countries of interest , only nominal GDP is less than 4.5 percent since 1950 .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only few that this would pers@@ ist and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the terms of the Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest rates in a so @-@ question@@ able economic setting could be ris@@ ky and submit the question , &quot; if this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have taken the whole year to an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could auth@@ ori@@ ze an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading will have a 25 percent increase .
&quot; in our study , all high @-@ efficiency cy@@ c@@ cy@@ tes from 1950 to today are taken place in a Super cycle with increasing vibrations while GDP had occurred very quickly after the start of recovery in the sha@@ dows , &quot; according to the report .
unlike this , this is a very slow recovery of what was the worst recession observed in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest ever since the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and this has been 74 months .
the solid income also became vol@@ ati@@ l , as the market is increasing an interest @-@ increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if those change their strategic classes .
as a result of bonds , the yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / lowering is carried out in the cycle .
at the end of the top of the increase in the bond , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in the interest rates will lead to the gap between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a decrease of the curve .
highly @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate even though &quot; we are still very c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ al@@ yst@@ in at Sch@@ wa@@ b in an analysis .
in fact , Jones says that the markets have already adjusted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; besides the power of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations there are several signs that the market has adjusted to a view of more str@@ ingent policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit@@ or have expanded , and the vol@@ atility rose - all features of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in the large and entire companies that are taking the greater part of their business activity in the USA , benefits if interest rates will increase and local products will be more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debt will be worse , as the dollar is investing its products on the global market more expensive , and also financing its debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive , three months after an initial rate of interest , Gold@@ man Sachs analy@@ st said in a report for the customers .
firms with strong balance , companies with weak balance after each of the rate of interest in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 exceeded the average by 5 percentage points .
the companies with high capital ratio and low vol@@ atility in their shares have also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest are losing on the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure shar@@ ehol@@ dings , consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollar .
those could see gains by higher income , even if experts in different opinion , as quickly will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament director Andrew B@@ ingham
the con@@ serv@@ atives of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for his &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he has argu@@ ed that he is increasingly not distinguished by commercial Ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she cited only The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins won the Voice of The Voice on and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading member of the Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does something that do not do the private .
the con@@ serv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public radio stations &quot; ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ate &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished by its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 &quot; - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; ev@@ ap@@ per@@ ing &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started in December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seems to be The Br@@ its just under one name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spont@@ aneously mentioned examples , in which you are just im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
the BBC Vice @-@ Director , pointing out and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of his commercial competitors , when it comes to public music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and make new works in order , I have really kept for important , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey said that harder to work hard to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC &apos;s production , which during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media , and sports for it under fire , to enter the commercial rival to the feet .
the T@@ ory writers , Dam@@ ien Collins , picked The Voice On - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show at BBC , bought by Dutch producers Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it isn &apos;t original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC &apos;s show was produced by Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - &quot; in a special BBC way . &quot;
he added , he would like that the company &quot; got a hit from our &quot; house stable &quot; if it took the next time in entertainment venues .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from further rows of The Voice in the future , or to spend money in the play modes for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose in August of the slow@@ est and Black Friday could be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase on online sales .
in the last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed down in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into cov@@ et@@ ousness .
but experts predic@@ t that there are now indications that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
overall expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers reached only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and then go back up to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; says Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales report to the Guardian .
he stated that online sales were more than three years ago , when Bu@@ yer began to collabor@@ ate with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now the one comm@@ utes themselves and we will probably see that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon was imported from America , is quoted as a reason for decl@@ ining sales .
experts believe that buyers will return their shopping before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers to make their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers were stor@@ med .
experts believe that black Friday , in which the purch@@ aser may carry with bar@@ gains , purch@@ as@@ ers may stop selling buyers .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that 5 £ issues had been issued a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of our purchases is now conducted using web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of people buys clothes and shoes rather than in the fashion chains inside the inner city .
Muslims are buried in Mec@@ ca , crane accident , Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tion@@ ed
the bodies of 29 dead are attributed to Muslims by the first desire in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia reli@@ es on the collapse of the giant Bin Laden &apos;s huge Saudi Bin Laden .
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed .
hundreds of Muslims were gathered as 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury the dead which were killed when a crane collapsed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s great mosque .
grape @-@ filled , largely in white , the way to declare their respect , when the first of the dead could begin their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m gra@@ vey@@ ard .
the mour@@ n@@ ession went over to the Holy Place where only days earlier a building crane collapsed by the ceiling of the mosque and then pl@@ ung@@ ed to the concrete .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi @-@ king passed over the construction company bin Laden , because of the catastrophe , which imposed also 3@@ 94 to the last one , a sanctions imposed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 farms , who were killed when a crane collapsed by the Great Central Station of Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
under the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram found himself from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who had crashed on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collapsed .
Mr Ak@@ ram served with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already announced that the H@@ add@@ sch after Mek@@ ka will continue to pass , with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today , king Sal@@ man , the bin Laden &apos;s group would not have to stand the arm of the crane , when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree that was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency in the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the Company &apos;s leadership must be allowed to travel abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man came to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , which collapsed in a courtyard of the great mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims before the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month , were gathered .
the bin Laden group has not published any statements about the collapse of the Kran@@ s , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ris@@ ked the group because of its current safety measures , and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cr@@ ates en@@ cir@@ cled Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mos@@ sy as part of the massive building that is managed by the bin Laden .
since decades , the bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to Saudi Arabia and takes over major construction projects .
the dead leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a heal@@ th@@ ier son who was taken part of the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the sick came in a strong wind and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once a life of any healthy fac@@ tions .
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials investig@@ ates that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are paid to members of the carriers and the same sum to permanently wounded .

B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap East European cra@@ ft@@ men is over
Brit@@ ons employ more skilled workers , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe did increase their rise
that means that 200 other screens , which are based on professional tra@@ des@@ people , will be opening
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q outlets nation@@ ally close sales nationwide .
Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Br@@ ushes their h@@ ammers and brush in favor of the use of qualified European tra@@ des@@ people who carry out the work in their home
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush for painting from walls , they apparently belong to a minority .
meanwhile British employ more skilled workers to perform DIY jobs in their homes , as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who possesses the tree @-@ silk chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices , has over@@ taken over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 other screens stores focused on art@@ is@@ ans and close to 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten Kauf@@ decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment , men conce@@ aled the men .
she said it was necessary to present the growing demo@@ graphic trends which have more female single @-@ households that work more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this stronger to a balance .
in general , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in decision making .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British at the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed company , has also inspired their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied just 50 percent of the teams with women , including its Managing Board and CFO .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher res@@ cin@@ ded a decline in half @-@ year profit and par@@ agra@@ phs , after the group had paid the costs for the closing of shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
professional use of a@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
in Kl@@ agen@@ furt village on Wednesday , two officials from the Austrian volleyball player a@@ I / DO@@ B must have been responsible for lack of faith@@ less and pro@@ curement .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged for abuse of abuse .
on this accus@@ ation , he was acquitted in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the investigation , the accused was cryst@@ all@@ ised that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 had fo@@ aled @-@ up of club accounts , which they were able to disp@@ ose in their functions , used for private purposes .
it is a damage of around 400,000 Euro .
the sports officials are also charged for financial inc@@ ts .
this fac@@ tum was divided by the Chairman of the Senate , Rich@@ ir Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence appe@@ aled that the association had not had a possession of wealth .
the sports officials had been expecting just compensation and sports club for whom they had spent in 1982 @-@ 2011 and invested a lot of time and money from the liabilities - the Passi@@ va was approximately 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approximately 4@@ 4,000 € ) in 2001 .
&quot; we stood before the situation : &quot; do we continue un@@ lock the club or block us ? , &quot; she told one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ related gener@@ ation@@ e@@ fer of the financial centre .
he then co @-@ def@@ endants with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; we took money in advance , with our life insurance than security at the bank , &quot; he said on receiving it .
have agreed with the association : you can manage your money free , it can only be made public .
at the appropriate financial success , the payout of the margin increases was retro@@ active until 1991 .
as a result , a lot of the revol@@ ving exposure starts only years later , namely from 2003 , when an increase has been on the account , paid out .
therefore , l@@ ump@@ et and non @-@ detailed bookings , the former Ob@@ server inter@@ pret@@ ended to explain the processes .
the two def@@ endants were managed together , def@@ endant the def@@ endants , said the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs had not been revealed in detail , the judge asked .
the association did not concern himself in detail for financial planning , it was only essential for the debt of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 , when the inquiries began to function , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club &apos;s account .
that had been back , the def@@ endants pleaded .
this securities open on the name of the second accused , and , according to the society , was not known .
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted to know the judge .
for this , the question was not answered .
then he said , he thought he was the best for the club .
if something happened to him , no one would have known anything of that money , the prosecutor asked the public prosecutor .
the accused was informed of being informed , the function@@ ary of the function@@ ary .
this transaction was form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation &quot; .
why does damage fit ? , judge and public prosecutor wanted to know .
the first def@@ endant stated that he was not agree with this formulation , because the association was never before a damage .
but what shall I do if the lawyer tells us : &quot; with that you are all out of the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
he said the function@@ ary , he never engaged a cent salary , he has only charged mil@@ estones and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he added 1.000 Euro per month to the club , but the actual effort was much higher , added , added .
exact documents for the early years could not prove the def@@ endants .
these should be judged correctly after an inspection test , in which everything had been judged correctly , no longer have been kept .
kilometer was also included in the second def@@ endant .
all can be done in cash in order to do so , he explained in his testimony from the place of international law to the bank of Blei@@ burg .
the trial will be continued on September 23 with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of witnesses .

the set of positions at the US computer company He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) cannot find an end .
within its restructuring , the US technology power@@ house plans to provide a reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate headquarters .
this means that costs are to be saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion Euros ) , the company distributed on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of approximately $ 2.7 billion , exp@@ iring from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs for the past three years is not yet incomplete .
in the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP still had around 30@@ 2,000 associates .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : Serbian Border Business on the Serbian @-@ Hungarian Border
the Hungarian police have deployed in the Serbian Border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water officers against several hundred attra@@ cting refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ v correspon@@ dent D@@ án@@ dez Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced the violence of the border control point .
he reported to call :
a group of refugees broke out the border .
behind a pol@@ ishing line and behind the police officers , there was a water eth@@ ro@@ wer .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw away stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
moreover , the officers were subjected to un@@ interrupted pep@@ per@@ al spray .
afterwards , the police used tr@@ ent@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
the group was dis@@ b@@ anded .
the refugees have now withdrawn from themselves .
a pregnant and apparently last woman was carried away from the zone .
children , who had breath@@ ed the tear @-@ down , cried .
other refugees are s@@ add@@ led together and suffered in short@@ ness of breath .
the press secretary of Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pep@@ per@@ oxide .
time of Dec@@ ision on Inter@@ est Rates for the US bank@@ note
the world has been observed , if the US monetary bank depends on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade , the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reuters , found that a little more than half , which would do the F@@ ed to do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will hold .
it is a historic event , since it has been seven years ago since the F@@ ed has been placed on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach the situation in which a large central bank may aband@@ on the zero range and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel K@@ bide , chief employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy depends on a relatively good performance , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less dense outlook on global conditions .
she warned the markets , pointing to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds are good for such a step .
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm GMT on Thursday
ob@@ sc@@ ure at the Delta State University , caused the loss of debt
after the shooting and killing of his girl@@ friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues later on day , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to tell him that he was &quot; sorry &quot; for the first murder and wanted that &quot; he could not make it un@@ au@@ red , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that lamb , lecturer of ge@@ ography and social education at Delta State University , calling the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , He shot up someone and someone killed .
in turn , Lamb said the staff at the emergency center that the police had to send c@@ ops to his home .
he said &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; in the house may be , but &quot; no one will distur@@ b , &quot; but probably will be excited .
the police asked the call of his name , but he did not exist .
lamb had no explanation for his kis@@ ses .
when police entered the scene , they found the body from Amy Pr@@ abh@@ or , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to do it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved Me . &quot;
after writing the note , 1,@@ 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police had um@@ bling him .
all university president William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that Pr@@ p@@ iss have also made a relationship with Schmidt , said the authorities on Tuesday , I admit &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ p@@ iss was Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were separated by 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ p@@ iss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the floor . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ p@@ iss had her daughter , &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ p@@ iss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who identified the Sun Herald as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ p@@ iss had a dog called Light@@ ning where he met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les
the police said , &apos; Lamb , calling for a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he is not going into prison . &quot;
when police paid him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on that night , lamb had left his car on the side , fled to the foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb Lub@@ ri@@ cated from the Delta State University in spring of 2015 , awarded a Ph.@@ D. , on behalf of the University &apos;s website .

all this is for sure its tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa makes the Group around
the Lufthansa plans to build a large consolidated company .
with a better organization , the Lufthansa Group alone wants to save half a billion euros a year .
150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the job to work .
in the pilot plant there is a new negotiations .
the Lufthansa operates its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates to Euro@@ wings .
the aim is to set up an earnings contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and contribution sy@@ ner@@ gies , divided the airline by Wednesday .
amongst others , there is no longer a board for passenger engines in Lufthansa .
the Euro@@ wings , which should be specially developed for this purpose , should be developed as an independent product .
in the board of Directors by chief Carsten Spo@@ hr in future Karl Ulrich Ul@@ am will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
the order emphas@@ izes the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group will plan to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines will operate under the Air@@ line Group &apos;s roof , the three quarters of 2013 annual revenue of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflicts with the pilot project cockpit speakers ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the judicial strike on this Thursday .
that divided the union with .
the topic of talks should be the qui@@ eter scheme for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year with a projected recru@@ iting score , &quot; quickly possible to sustainable results . &quot;
the conflict between trade union and air@@ line has led to various strikes in recent months .
in addition , in addition to the trans@@ itional provision of the pilots , the Spar@@ co concept is &quot; Wings . &quot;
it is obvious that Lufthansa ranks in the fight against competitive flights to the band &apos;s own low @-@ price range .

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can not play for months because of double fre@@ action
Luke Shaw suffered a double copy of his right buttons on the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven .
while keeping the right def@@ ending champ@@ ions brought him weeping and close it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give up hope that Shaw can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack of h@@ é@@ ap Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Shaw was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has double leg infrastructure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be re@@ located tomorrow or perhaps later in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic is happening .
in the changing cabin , he had a oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor but if you have double frac@@ tures , it will take six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and a suspension of a mo@@ ths .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , won &apos;t leave the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had stri@@ pped .
they can judge for themselves , when I say that one El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were sus@@ cep@@ tible .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a visit to Sha@@ ws account used : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe how kap@@ ut I bin , my way to recovery begins now , I come again back . &quot;
concerning this : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at the PS@@ V
the England defence attor@@ ney has added an additional inc@@ entive to the European Championship in France , and will recover until next June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ o , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it is a very gri@@ ev@@ ous injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the spot with this type of injury , all very sor@@ row@@ fully .
it &apos;s never the intention of our player to inj@@ ure an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ As The Netherlands on the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear that it is a very gri@@ ev@@ ous injury , that is not good , &quot; Coc@@ o said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball who was driving a different direction , so it looked like if he had touched &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad there . I &apos;m so tired .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also brought to hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ ash by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost in@@ wardly .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book appe@@ aled , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax opted to be published by Dr. Se@@ uss , which appeared in 1971 .
it was a difficult election , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the super camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to always have a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the subsequent passage in which Cameron allegedly describes the book of the book , instead , gives a summar@@ izing the film version of 2012 , added to the new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y wants to see the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to see their desire to see a true tree , fulfilled , &quot; he reads , a love of love was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage , but completely unknown in 1991 .
as if this is not be susp@@ icious enough : the text is presented in partially as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database , which is all artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
though he ad@@ here to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron kept up the act of the book so little . here , an un@@ en@@ aged boy , like the local environment through the faced Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ wling , aromatic creatures that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; will be rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to one assistant who has read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Do@@ wning Street discussion said the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons nom@@ ads .
the Super Camp confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons employees was delivered , but there was no further immediate comm@@ ent@@ aries .
Adam Ly@@ th was definitely threatened with the exclusion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult .
turning to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you have chosen the Ka@@ der that sees England for the tour , there is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series defeat at my card .
I would not utter a down@@ ward win .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will bear no sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
the ball develops into a spin @-@ level Mo@@ by Ali as a Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , Even if he represents an unknown size on test @-@ level , it is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Ly@@ th declares from the England test cad@@ dies and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , being his principal trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are targeted at results .
there was no question@@ ing at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this to it - players their own best choice .
long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
if he beats New York for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance arrives .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss engaged his attitude , even though he did not offer such good performance , and that surprised me ; he is especially a team man .
the question , how much time a test @-@ cat@@ cher receives , to set his sign is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine got .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to play home and out@@ ward play .
the only accus@@ ation which one can rise was that England was first put down Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a cat@@ astro@@ phy , who set me high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in that season , when he hit us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge way , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chance as those receiving before him , but this depends , of course , from the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of going to cook Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would get a little spin @-@ off bow@@ ler and didn &apos;t get four j@@ icks , I caught , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can not strike there , and this road @-@ handed has already shown that he is a v@@ icious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not get his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is there a number 3 for them , and there is no difference .
my earlier team @-@ mate Justin Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests with the first drop , before he appeared as Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately managed to get three hundred R@@ uns and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Abdul@@ ari is in the ca@@ des as a back @-@ up @-@ sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup co@@ bs that lift up their hands and the coach have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few smart supplements with train@@ ers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ion of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes with the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use to the setup .
I felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and how Mah@@ ela convinced he insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the messages are consistent with what they said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used at the One @-@ Day@@ er , root was a similar pause against Australia and I for my part have no problem with that .
some do not agree , but co@@ aches and team @-@ makers don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you must remember , that , as players depend on the results , their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken from light in heart .
Bre@@ xit camp ( Bre@@ xit = dro@@ pping Great Britain out of the EU ) could win on Zul@@ u if the economy will move into a spra@@ ying unit by 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ equi@@ vocal ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ator strategy to keep Britain within the EU , even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy - Is it &quot; yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leaders of Labour or the TU@@ C , who suffered severe decline because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
there was a European diplom@@ at who said that some member states , as deep stri@@ pped in various crises , as the EU has now seen , and not always from own guilt , Britain even created issues with divided conc@@ essions and trou@@ bles@@ tions , which they usually don &apos;t want to be satisfied .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not like it to end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , a photograph of themselves from a famous local monument , with or without local size , come home and say that they would win allies for reforms .
it is all about me .
my European friend who wishes to look at the outside of the EU @-@ Zel@@ da - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone look with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can be seen through the fact that more and more short @-@ supervised ministers and civil servants have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we are staying or going .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it did in the exagger@@ ated long @-@ term ex@@ hal@@ es such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a dist@@ ass@@ uring force .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right government , le@@ ft@@ ist in Spain .
it is hard to imagine that they will be able to deliver a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British , whose energy should be used to prevent the climate change from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most of the similar separ@@ at@@ ist ten@@ dencies have to be used .
therefore , some such ministers may not even use hel@@ pl@@ ess notes , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ ee 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , you probably susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won none of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how vig@@ or@@ ish the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics did not have been the oli@@ gar@@ chie of the press bar@@ ons in 1975 but not that our entry was supported in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may remember being weak to Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro con@@ cili@@ ation@@ ists who made themselves a name as a &quot; EU @-@ long ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s .
with all his ref@@ us@@ ability , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
to this end the med@@ ley of tax @-@ for@@ ged jack@@ ets , telephone @-@ h@@ aul@@ ing foreigners and pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners , most of our large newspapers have belonged .
actually , Tony Bla@@ ir thought about them , but noted that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you can get better ban@@ anas to di@@ stra@@ ct him away instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ y@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself , when he had refused the principle of speech in the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which then opened a back@@ door opened to him .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time for me - seems to be in danger to repeat Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ ard@@ ott Mur@@ ter &apos;s strategy of 80 @-@ 70 years , a mistake then and today .
it may last but he has to develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ lob@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I &apos;ll put it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ant trend and the wild @-@ fil@@ th of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may be said to say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary was &quot; a Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n at the Radio and TV this week did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s appointment in the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father trem@@ bled on TV , loyal to his Labour cabinet Cab@@ inet , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his supporters and MPs to all reports on Monday evening on Monday evening .
whatever the touching kind @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n tell you - remember that he even has touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right , Cameron doesn &apos;t give up free tickets to Europe which allows him to keep lab@@ ours in the referendum for a matter of course , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins surely think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic pre@@ am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with her Benn@@ ite exposure @-@ economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is not just a matter of the es@@ ot@@ eric discussion on left dis@@ sidents for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son stands firmly convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign for the outlet , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin pursue political capital - they have also mis@@ leading voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all can be po@@ int@@ less ?
the U.S. is fairly dis@@ apo@@ inted by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ reduction in the T@@ ory government in power where I was able to remind you of what was called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking from a meeting of 12 individuals , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ise the findings of the Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive audit of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have asked the data of data in@@ qu@@ ery and put them on connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extraordinary &quot; foundation &quot; based on the P@@ he launched its major conclusion .
two other researchers are writing in BM@@ J and have asked whether to build the claims &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said the fact that the statement of P@@ he that &quot; is the present best estimate , &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are approximately 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ critical analysis criteria ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) in order to lead their opinions on the damages of various Nik@@ ot@@ in @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a Sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , which was to have received its managing director of British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes producer , but not the financing which he should have received from tobacco company Philip Morris International , compl@@ aining that it was added .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes Champions , some of which also provide sector finance in the paper .
several other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco line of P@@ he took part .
the research work of the group &quot; is indic@@ ative &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , no one of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the alleg@@ ations of P@@ he said that &quot; there has so far been no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking rooms &quot; were premature ejaculation .
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J has already responded to the statements by BM@@ J .
he said , &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second smo@@ ker smoking is dying on its suff@@ ice .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to these but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the distinct obligation on the information of the public about what evidence of evidence and what is not , especially if there is much public confusion about the relative danger of the relative danger of tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die each year on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking cost the National Health System two billion a year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking causes it , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , former head of Channel 4 says .
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercially ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said the radio charge only should be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ caster .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are public to open public utilities which probably can probably be seen by a smaller audience , into hard @-@ cont@@ ested time window against the most popular shows of their rival and sen@@ ders , like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said the company more in partnership with other organizations I said Johnson said he was trying to come into contact with the BBC for six years in his time with Channel 4 .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned , or sends , that would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rival , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee in the context of his investigation on BBC &apos;s future .
when you want to keep the radio cost , which I mean medium or long @-@ term not for a good idea , one should stop his production at least on programs that do not do or commissioned anything .
they send The Voice in a first class time window , because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous but it &apos;s natural .
Johnson said , &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive control is financed , which could also be financed without subsidi@@ zation .
the voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own product production .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give its right arm .
I stri@@ ve to see how this should be public @-@ public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would decrease the BBC .
Johnson , a business@@ man for series that led the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is on the hunt for reviews , &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts on the BBC will give back what the former leaders of Sky , Tony Ball , presented to Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how to sell the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the more publicly available non @-@ legal pro @-@ programs should go to BB@@ C4 but they are unable to implement their duties , but they can argue that when they are created on their apparent missions of £ 4 billions of broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these preserved programs which no one has seen . &quot;
they place it in a time window , in which no one ever wanted to see it ever .
in addition to the broadcast fee Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather rainy system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here .
of course , think all we think that one receives a great value for 150 pounds per year , but for those who &apos;s a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , I wonder if that &apos;s true , as they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ walk and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also promised before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should examine and enter@@ tain their &quot; Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to form , form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little from the BBC &apos;s production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in radio - and they should then change this in public @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the one of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of TV will be shown to go away with the commercial transm@@ it@@ ers , and make everything online available .
&apos;@@ O@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound imp@@ ul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by bur@@ sting of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they have high frequencies for the human hearing at high frequencies , to be heard , ir@@ radi@@ ated .
the imp@@ etus work by switching from mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry out the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asound waves .
about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said , the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ els@@ sohn , when she is used to dis@@ able a number of brain , heart and muscle cells out of the body .
Sre@@ ć@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the process of a day could replace deep brain stim@@ ulation , inv@@ ests an invas@@ ive process to ab@@ duct electrical imp@@ ul@@ ses into the brain treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
fil@@ th@@ ek@@ ers do not react on ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noticed that they were doing when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic aerial bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asound waves , which are then penet@@ rating the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asonic sensors act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves are the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells that they are assigned , as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ ions of TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry .
when he turns ultr@@ asound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ blo@@ ws and transferred into the worms , where they turn off the changed mot@@ ions .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool which allows researchers to im@@ pose neur@@ ons with imp@@ ul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent down on an optical fibre to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic sensors can prevent soft@@ ly , and can thus be sk@@ ill@@ fully sent to the brain from top to the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus is possible , the targeted human neur@@ ons are temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical procedure for certain neuro@@ logical applications , &quot; said Tom@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added .

eight golden rules for living in halls of residence
eleven years ago I moved to a student residence at a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and mor@@ ally re@@ at@@ vism , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who I have sc@@ and@@ alized - and to the numerous , long @-@ appro@@ ve complaints about others .
most of the things I &apos;ve learned can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the move in a student residence is enough to frigh@@ tening up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to che@@ ers : people tell where you come from , whether and where you get the Sabbath year , where you can neither love Mar@@ m@@ ite or hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just one yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
this gives a conversation and helps you to find people who they like , in contrast to those who would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes would be burned in fire and this fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave humans .
people often turn into drinks recipes , film @-@ night venues and public meeting points , but they are also the places where people put on themselves and their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start working on the university with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ees receive a rough handling of the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many students residence are a space @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee @-@ culture that is kind and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I love you , and I want our friendship , but you go away to get the energy that I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of soci@@ alizing is exhausted , and send SMS to an SMS response instead .
apro@@ pos ank@@ lo@@ ps : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
Friend@@ ship with B@@ aking .
since you start the university at the cli@@ max of the Back mania , the clo@@ ak is at the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of bro@@ w@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked you a bit pack . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
tasty home @-@ made treats is a good path to close friend@@ ships .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain , and will associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are an decent b@@ aker .
bad tain@@ ted cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat , that people will sleep more sleeping if you anchor .
steal food is a common crime in residence halls .
of course , the cla@@ ws of hen is theft , but is it taking a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea ?
check it with the milk owner .
chances are , they say to yourself , even if they cook in inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , this is annoying , and you have my emp@@ athy , but try to get more balanced than my fellow people who added to her milk a washing machine to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
it &apos;s now in prison .
you should make no noise , the people from sleep or off the job .
it is not only about being a decent human being , but that you belong to man in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al who sit in the glass .
a girl on my floor asked its neighbors , if there was something out of them , Drum &amp; Bass makes a little more qui@@ eter than at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more listening music .
and when they finally heard about 5 p.m. their neighbours , they had only sleeping two hours before leaving their own music , shut their door and went to their three hour inspection .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would happen by chance in the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be fundamental to embar@@ rass@@ ing if you have a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future marriage partners , to separate themselves , and will see them again every day , and perhaps to experience it , how they have all shared friends move far@@ ther ?
of course , the heart is his own way - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future wife partner , try at least to speak a little reason .
at the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his key in his non @-@ locked room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing f@@ einer , than it seems .
a good photo is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share a valuable and am@@ using Less@@ on of security - but you never have any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
shut down your door , and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but stap@@ le your bel@@ ong@@ ings at the ceiling no more than twice .
ter@@ raced houses for refugees , all@@ ot@@ ers , straight operators
the property management Markus Guil@@ dner reli@@ es on the central fr@@ en@@ c Eck@@ es ter@@ raced houses for people who have not much money .
so for example , for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need dormitories , but as well as those who are confron@@ ted by the poor . &quot;
&quot; I show how you can still build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees are pushing onto the property market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Guil@@ dner decided to know how fast retail space can be created : it builds inside a project ter@@ raced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the property market .
what solutions do you offer ?
Markus Guil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay in a great part here .
in the face of the refugee stream we also need enough living room in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ ish , three @-@ storey tire service is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a few place for the ter@@ raced house .
it facil@@ it@@ ates the integration .
that is different , if one sub@@ divide the people in living blocks .
each of the six homes that are currently being built in the pilot project consist of three units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees say , it is peace again , I go back .
then , houses can be re@@ arranged easily according to their respective requirements .
how high are the costs ?
Guil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of space per house is available at 184 000 Euro , without property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction has lasted for six months .
this is fair .
have the provisions made complicated ?
Guil@@ dner : I realised my project correctly .
it is particularly complicated , always the imp@@ ending Dam@@ o cl@@ es@@ hy special construction and placement agencies .
gr@@ assy .
it still is sub@@ ordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a ter@@ raced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no room for this .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how have the residents responded to their ter@@ raced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury cars for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but do not tigh@@ ten the competitors for affordable housing ?
Guil@@ dner : true there is : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but were built there were luxury apartments that can hardly be able to afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the m@@ aturing pro @-@ income , or the Ger@@ b@@ ass@@ a .
I &apos;ll show how to build and build well today .
that is why it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by entering into &quot; General &quot; type and then select &quot; software update . &quot;
if it is ready , you can download the phone option to download and then install .
some have been encountered after installation , since they get an error message inform@@ ing that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot;
to handle the problem , users are recommended to have either wait until the rush returns or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
that may make sense of del@@ e@@ tion of apps to make space - but Apple has made it impro@@ b@@ able by the sealing of updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you are using a special tool to delete apps and then install it once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your cell phone is charged while updating , or is located close to a charging station so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will continue , as the phone may stop on half way and this could result in a break of updates .

&quot; at the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ resi@@ ausen ch@@ uck@@ led .

&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or . many patients surely still often see , &quot; says the intern .
her husband is growing : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;

in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now , the border controls are carried on at our southern border , &quot; said Minister for System Jo@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
the controls on the Hungarian border are parallel critical .
in accordance with how clear is that anyone who wants to asylum a request for asylum is &quot; self @-@ granted &quot; of course .
the supply and safety of the people stand in the background .
it is clear , however , that there needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people must know that we don &apos;t accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ slo@@ ven@@ ian border .
it needs an controlled approach .
Croatia is considering the &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously reported to have Slovenia , coming refugees towards Austria and Germany , and also establishing the cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this was how the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ ll@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar was not seen there .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors may be &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather be the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
on the other hand , the border with Croatia may already be heavily controlled .
as the Minister is stressed , Slovenia wants to not reach its borders for refugees however .
&quot; each EU member must fill his comm@@ it@@ ments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ ll@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian Government said , the first refugees had tried already in the night hours to Tuesday to pass in eastern Croatian by the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to exp@@ ire the registration .
the Croatian police attacked her in the near corn fields .
according to local media since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles still use new refugees .
there are mainly for Syrians and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
in the coming days his country with around 4000 refugees , the Minister of the Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
furthermore , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo should be taken to the Maced@@ onian Serbian border , which had previously led to the Hungarian border , agreed to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Serbian government denied it , however , that it would be certain that people would like to suggest certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor want to do this , &quot; he said .
according to the media reports , a first bus had arrived in the morning in the morning with around 50 refugees in the town of S@@ id in the course of the day , more bus@@ ses would expected .
through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria after Germany
the passengers were traveling by Serbia throughout the night of some 500 kilometres away to the Maced@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has tried , so the police have said that we should come here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
thus it could have already been predicted by far @-@ predicted moving of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary on a little further west .
Croatia : comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister for Interior in O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country for the case of a strong state of refugees have prepared appropriate plans for possible ren@@ al situations .
he does not refer to details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &apos; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
you hold tight controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner has consistently been a good report about the country , which affects the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian site , some 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border of the Hungarian border .
according to the media reports , they last night at Hor@@ g@@ os border crossing , who led to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , both the two border trans@@ itions Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining fug@@ iti@@ ves want to pass on to the Croatian border is still uncertain .
the Minister of the Interior Minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic tried to calm on Wed@@ nes@@ days at a local instant in Hor@@ g@@ os . it is keeping the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature ejaculation .
it would not be a very high number of refugee camps .
it could not be said whether they would continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia or another country .
helper and migrants to - dangerous - Alternative items
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute the spread of these maps , which represented alternative routes by Croatia .
however , border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of border area there are still 20 years after the end of the conflict there still no more spacious min@@ ef@@ ields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine swe@@ epers was sent to the border region .
stock ex@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians will pay 30 million dollars

with the exploited information , insi@@ ders @-@ business should have been made on the financial markets .
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; the current comparison shows that even those who are finally caught outside of our country borders , &quot; says the SEC @-@ Not@@ ification .
the trials against 32 continued to be continued in the case .
most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .

ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ edy Mannheim , Germany , has been working 20 years
all around the Mannheim par@@ ade@@ platz is a re@@ active service .

keeping the cars .
pul@@ s@@ ating , pr@@ un@@ ing life at stunning autumn sun @-@ cou@@ pon and issu@@ er four large boards each with the title &quot; Pre@@ or I dying ... &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ism Hosp@@ it@@ ality opened this action to their 20th anniversary with this promotion , and would definitely face mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we are with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer .
the head of ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ ality is also available to the gi@@ ants as well as questions and talks about the volunteer employees .
while some pass@@ ant spont@@ aneously posts up on chal@@ k and set the sentence to &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; do not survive long , &quot; say phr@@ ases like &quot; so far I am not &quot; and then go on . &quot;
again , at the edge of small discussions develop over the action , about life , dealing with dying .
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is just on site .
&quot; only when I realise that at some point in the end of this world , I can act responsi@@ bly &quot; , &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic Wer@@ kes of Mannheim , which is common with the Car@@ ite @-@ Association of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ian Hosp@@ it@@ ality .
therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for 20 @-@ year @-@ olds .
that not everyone wants to communicate on the tablets , however , be understand@@ able , finally , it was a very personal deal .
the subject of death and dying is to be punished with Tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , al@@ beit the Hosp@@ iz@@ ers in recent years have contributed so much that people open .
a finding which is divided by Angel@@ ika go@@ at@@ roid .
the death and funeral proc@@ ession belongs to the honorary employees of the first hour .
by personal enlighten@@ ment , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in death @-@ help .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ ality entered the call of Hon@@ our , she immediately reported and was there with the establishment in the year 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ y belongs to a team of 45 honorary Legal - 43 women and two men - the affected and depend@@ ents in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ z Saint Vincent .

Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ y is well done with their task and experiences about experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another waiting , hold it for precious and ch@@ asing the moment , &quot; she says .
the offer of out@@ patient &apos;s out@@ patient community service is free and conf@@ essi@@ onal .

all two years of training , training courses for new employees are offered .
the boards described above are described in the house of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1a ) and on the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
other personal wishes can be recorded for postcards , too .
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ income mixed , financial outlook for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the final quarter , and the song Gig@@ ant lowered his profit to a year owing to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his boat transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 min@@ workers during the holidays .
at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
the share fell above 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. claimed a win between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than at the previous forecast .
analysts expected according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the low views occur despite the price increases , which will amount to 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4 and despite the higher supply for boat transport of heavy and major packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that earnings were increasing from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and due to growth in online retail .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company will take solid earnings when the expected economic conditions are expected , especially in production and global trade . &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations on vacation were announced a day later as the rival to UPS , the plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex was sold to 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks investment research asked to predic@@ t analysis .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of Z@@ acks resolved to expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex published a decline in international Pri@@ ority disp@@ atch in recent years , which den@@ ounced the turnover in his unit Express Shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has raised the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
in the last quarter sales were driven by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher cost for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit posted higher income due to higher prices , while the result was falling due to higher operating costs in the freight sector .
in the pre @-@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares offer by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week to sit around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ ony @-@ table to decide if it is time for the first time since almost a decade the guide will begin .
above all , in an end of the ridic@@ uled , two @-@ story seat @-@ sa@@ vers , there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder of that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ella and her colleagues intend to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double @-@ digit order from the Congress : maxim@@ ization of US employment and prices keep stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ reliable third @-@ term mandate : financial stability .
and this third term of mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predic@@ t it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready , by the un@@ equ@@ alled inc@@ entive by the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy have shown that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets , which are already anxi@@ ous to rein@@ force these volumes by raising interest rates for federal bonds - and it is also just one percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , director of the Mak@@ ing @-@ company , and Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think , if they were looking for a pre@@ text that were unable to increase the interest rate , increased in@@ security relating to the global market is enough just@@ ification , still waiting , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed is doing , which self @-@ sec@@ ures themselves within the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists , who were recently questioned about Bloomberg , have predicted an interest rate per week .
the financial markets , however , expect : the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists beat the impact by pointing out that a further increase is far away .
in Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial segment rose by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
action was triggered by expectations , that the F@@ ed policy maintained its sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would take those sets at that time , &quot; he said .
if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets , so that they cannot fall into panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an interest rate would calm down the financial markets , because they would remove in@@ security when the F@@ ed should act .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on track to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow con@@ vening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of rest in the USA .
Y@@ ellen said in the spring and early summer , that it would be necessary in the year despite the symptoms of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required to raise an increase in the proposition .
although the creation of employment slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that F@@ ed sees as full@@ time employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation remained below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , F@@ ed representatives reported that the main reason would be the temporary effect of considerably lower oil prices .
the economy can overcome higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ wise .
but the financial markets of all over the world gathered together at the end of the last month after having de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would increase global growth .
this month the market has recovered a little , but the Dow Automotive has now been around 10 % under the sovereignty of May .
for the F@@ ed Representative , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation , when you should increase the interest rate .
&quot; if events were not performed on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US bank@@ note .
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certainty concerning what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the main causes of F@@ ed , so they should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous during the last years .
the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could dis@@ close their monetary expansion &quot; and dis@@ sol@@ ving confusion about the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , it can be expected from the F@@ ed representatives , that they will not only monitor the developments in other locations , but also discuss with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the Management Company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ interaction on financial market movements , with apparently not associated with the economic fund@@ ament data . &quot;
L@@ acker , legitim@@ ate member of the Federal Open Market Committee , opposed to an interest rate of interest , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its gui@@ deline by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite lim@@ iting effect on growth in the United States , &quot; said L@@ acker .
a year later , the F@@ ed House acknowledged these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis as the financial collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on the dis@@ closing of the Bank of England .
the youngest turbul@@ ences are not close to this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly did not want to fall into the situation in which she is afraid of interest @-@ interest rate because the markets were an exciting , &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it would require the time .

Brazil &apos;s p@@ ä@@ th@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian Organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy in a sho@@ cking way up women as important to diet during the breast@@ feeding time . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted in sn@@ out , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk is made of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers will catch their daily cal@@ orie intake to increase about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ eting adaptation that the mothers should be performed .
a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy eating pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , a child &apos;s un@@ healthy diet may neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the Chal@@ de@@ an Bern@@ ward appro@@ ves the contract for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he did an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar plant .
the plans for the long @-@ long gym facility at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are step forward : in the recent municipal meeting , the revised construction application was blessed without large discussions .
the panel had previously agreed to submit an application for the basis &quot; respec@@ tive &quot; liberation &quot; from the valid development plan .
with the &quot; exception , &quot; we went to permit a special form to the roof structure .
accordingly , a &quot; s@@ uns@@ hi@@ c roof with non @-@ adher@@ ent first and roof super@@ structure should be established . &quot;
background of planning is the planned use of the roof insulation space for solar plants : &quot; this way , we get a wonder@@ fully large South shelter , &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the &quot; Liberation , &quot; in turn , the roof @-@ incl@@ ination that is prescribed for energy reasons - unlike the development plan , is to lie below ten degrees .
this will significantly reduce the volume of Halle .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore needed because of the development plan on the ti@@ lt no &quot; exceptions &quot; permit - where the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council rule quite restri@@ ctive for deliver@@ ance to more restri@@ ctive installations .
the turn@@ around is a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym equipment at the Sports Centre is a community project , and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated to be around 2.3 million euros .
grants are expected from school and lat@@ itude sports .
in the next step of process the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter @-@ large hall is presented to the audit@@ or for testing .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg draws to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station , as well as the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
we see the surprising plans of the hospital , the Land@@ kre@@ ise , who confirmed the coun@@ sellers of Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
but the decision on board is to meet the Supervisory Board , and the t@@ end@@ ent on coming Wednesday , September 23 .
if plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue on hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
vast majority should be moved with fishermen and the further existing interior post to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the employees who do not have to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , are to be offered a workplace at W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed about the plans .
triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a physician from the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , has now moved to a private practice near the hospital .
by the question of who will come into Him , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came to the game which was ready to take over management and to take over with his team according to Sch@@ ong@@ au , from 1 October .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means an &quot; recovery &quot; and an extension of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
fishermen is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the interior of gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
in view of the next two years Fischer with his team , if the supervisory board is entitled to agree , both houses will lead until the next year the former hospital in the prison , which still has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed after almost 140 years .
the county has planned this year by 2018 , if the current re@@ development was completed at the hospital at W@@ eil@@ heim .
Land@@ ing in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , rum@@ our of which the house , which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I close it . &quot; how do I connect to the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White couldn &apos;t say that there are several consider@@ ations .
there are currently a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day sy@@ chiat@@ ry accommod@@ ated there .
&quot; what better could happen to us , such an opportunity come not again , &quot; as fishermen had been taken over the dom@@ est@@ ry to the Le@@ ch , who had been positively received by the employees &quot; positive and very understand@@ ably . &quot;
it has not been a real perspective for the house where fishermen has been working for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) in recent decades was always threatened with closure , divisions were closed , for example the surgery and birth aid .

refugees need accommodations : study warns of homes
the situation in the German residential market is ten@@ se .
also more refugees seek a paid stay .
pressure on the residential market is growing .
the social housing building stands facing a challenge .
the distributor in the German residential market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and unemployed people from the EU , more people push for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens across the last affordable housing .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , there would be 400,000 new units every year .
on the result of this result , a study on behalf of the social housing project &quot; Social residential construction . &quot;
for comparison : this year , 260@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
to this end 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer required after the first three months of their stay , which seek@@ ers to live an asylum seek@@ er .
many then put them on the office market and lined up in the long qu@@ eu@@ es in front of the apartments .
however , according to the Federal Office of Statistics , less than half of the asylum seek@@ ers were available .
however , the negative development of the residential market is not only the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant changes in residential policy of recent years .
Germany sh@@ ud@@ be a residential deficit to become bigger one year ago .
currently , about 77@@ ,000 units were missing in the metro@@ politan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many working professionals are therefore living in large cities in flat @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed together for the fl@@ au@@ te on the property market un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities the number of square metres per capita has decreased for the first time in recent years .
to resolve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social residential building &quot; strikes a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to stim@@ ulate the social housing situation .
the property tax could be ab@@ stain@@ ed , and the property tax for funded dwell@@ ings will be suspended .
also , according to the Alliance you need to use attractive fiscal downs .
the support program for refugee rental of the state bank Kf@@ W is already well equipped with towns and municipalities .
a good week after the start was on Monday evening with 184 million euros , more than half of the roughly 300 million euros available .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia faces a corridor
considering Hungary it is not a passage , there are always more refugees crossing the road through Croatia .
Zagreb announces that the journey through Slovenia to the north passed away without hur@@ d@@ les .
but this is not dangerous to the route .
for Croatia , Croatia wants to communicate via the neighbouring country of Slovenia over the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Slovenian interior minister , and if it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Home Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already a Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen area .
according to the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , there are hundreds of refugees to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people had come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV RTL Nacht@@ journal .
Hungary had blocked off his border for refugees .
new laws that came into effect on the same day , are extra@@ ordin@@ arily superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic said : &quot; you can go through , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
people however , who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police killed the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with both the bus and Ta@@ xes in the Serbian border city S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they tried to reach on foot across the green border to Croatia .
the refugees won &apos;t reach border f@@ ences at the Croatian @-@ Serb border .
the border strip offers other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90s .
min@@ ef@@ ields are now to create a safe passage .
according to Hungary , hardly more refugees came to Hungary after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday , the police closed 3@@ 66 offensive people .
just prior to Tor@@ ging on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws burst the conqu@@ ering and damage of the border to the off@@ ence .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed there were therefore 35 pen@@ al proceedings instit@@ uted .
prison sentences up to five years and the deportation of deportation after five years .
according to information from the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications agreed on Tuesday in the fron@@ tier in the border with 94 asylum applications - of which nearly all - 93 - are the main transfer of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically , nobody has granted a view to granted asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
in front of the &quot; transc@@ ei@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees were gathered .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to cut off workers .
they gathered up the tr@@ ash to leave the tens of thousands of people over the road in the past few weeks .
the pl@@ ums were dismant@@ led , and one of the ap@@ ul@@ ls in the border place was rebuilt .
no one was to express itself the goal of this renovation .
Austria is only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also reinforced its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants lost their borders yet in the country .
around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany in Salzburg .
traffic on traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities on the morning .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly by foot .
Mayor stepped &quot; rocks on the border
&quot; we were facing the bridge held on Sunday with the cleaning , when suddenly ten people stood out with travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany stopped near the refugee community on Sunday , however , because of the refugee stream there was no end in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; so Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and the stran@@ gled together with two other helicop@@ ters and their cars on the border to the Na@@ he Pass@@ au .
prior to the un@@ trusted guest we have only stayed together , with bur@@ ro@@ ar and drinks .
we have said right , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was of course for us , &quot; says the Stad@@ ler of the O@@ Ö@@ N .
they were very grateful .
a man left him not to transfer a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we are very happy , &quot; so Stad@@ ler .
the crossed rail adjustments had risen on Sunday evening in W@@ els from a ICE in a regional train for Pass@@ au , in order to arrive shortly after the short notice , that the railway traffic was finally adjusted to Germany , but to try along the border .
the regional train was removed , however , before the W@@ ern@@ stein line .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border @-@ crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge firm associated with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , every day before a two @-@ bridge sport@@ scar , organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical outcome of a apparent policy :
instead of helping to establish structures in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke site , human@@ ity helped to ass@@ ure human@@ ity , state that the Hungarian government has formally cleared the stance of the Hungarian government in the anti @-@ Hungarian government .
sorry for this policy are not only those Austrian who are confron@@ ted with cha@@ otic conditions now in the border areas .
moreover , they must state that the &quot; yel@@ low@@ ly land , &quot; which invited them and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp .
there will be a major challenge , in view of the persistent refugee flow and the near wind , who make decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers .
and there will be another greater - peace , security , and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the quest for 35.000 winter@@ ly qu@@ arri@@ es
Konrad has filled all hands with the refugee board .
Christian Konrad is always acc@@ ust@@ omed to have his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to stop qu@@ arti@@ facts for thousands of refugees .
chaos in the initial rise center in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already seen a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported his first success .
the allocation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday , was without great swi@@ vel , stated Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; master performance . &quot;
the Interior Minister , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
so there is a total of 8@@ 5,000 districts in the he@@ ur@@ ary year .
in order to meet the numbers , 35,000 accommodations must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will provide the federal government , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; reveals Konrad .
he has already led interviews with the capit@@ alists .
these have never been promised to create Qu@@ arti@@ ere for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria , he goes well , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar takes up Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , one should clari@@ fy how the church will help .
great expectations of the asylum seek@@ er also sets up the ORF action &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot;
individuals can offer individuals and accommodation on the platform .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier yesterday critic@@ ised the standards for &quot; very high . &quot;
in an emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must have a certain height of the towel @-@ holder or the size of the finishing positions .
for a temporary period , the &quot; Not@@ ice standard &quot; should apply .
by contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he reveals Konrad with his experience in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior .
I am an older gent@@ leman , who is not telling fal@@ se@@ hood yet again .
persu@@ as@@ ive force is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier does not cause the Republic from the republic , as they declared themselves .
their workforce , they want to increase it to three to four .
at the present time , his own qu@@ arti@@ facts have not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to hire a container at st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permit .
Linz requires a better distribution
first no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the City of Linz .
this is currently not necessary because you can now use those affected without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) .
however , additional locations should be inspec@@ ted for emergency services in case of emergency .
cr@@ iti@@ que of the city head to the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other areas must also make their contribution here .
See@@ hofer : &quot; borders are not blocked &quot;
in a longer telephone conference with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) passed the further procedure in the refugee question on Monday .
See@@ hofer gave me as@@ sures that the German border are not blocked .
further , the continuation of refugees in the FR@@ G is still possible .
however , there is the corresponding limit controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will never give it any more .
however , the protective seek@@ ers would however be brought to Germany by regular trains .
P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger asked once more hard solidarity in the refugee question from the other EU member states .
that now Austria le@@ ad@@ eth controls again to its limits , is a logical result for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , &quot; a logical result . &quot;
the next Run@@ ta@@ stic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
in four out of the six store@@ ys of office and production buildings , the publicly tra@@ ded IT Group S &amp; T is set to be vac@@ ated by young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in start@@ up companies in the New Ship@@ yard and later also to be acquired .
already from the beginning , S &amp; T cooperate with the new neighbors - a few of which promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ ta@@ stic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ centre , which belongs to a third of the City of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federal State ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is available at Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ centre .
thirty per cent of the 2700 square meter space in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent there are en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ ist opened his second shop in the arcade
the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are in the centre of the new shop .
in fact , Jut@@ ta Bre@@ it wanted to commit a dog .
this project had to move the 49 year old daughter of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt arcade : finally , she has got an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop against the business , which it sells among other things , bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clo@@ ths of various manufacturers , now everything is turning around the hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets owned by 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
this has been rebuilt several weeks earlier .
&quot; but I have long over@@ written whether I should open a store , &quot; says Bre@@ it .
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , who are at home in Bologna , was also translated from the idea of a personal site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only one in the wholesale price of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters that has even Italian roots .
her fashion interest has been placed by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I really like the most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman take a look at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the woman cannot answer the woman with the last safety .
perhaps , it is because a lovely bag is taking care of each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the industrial ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called investors .
this feature combines man@@ holes with billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become president of US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for a thr@@ ong .
whether it expresses foreign fin@@ sel@@ essly , journalists sur@@ faced or tri@@ po@@ g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the applicant of the US presidential am@@ pl@@ ess den@@ i@@ ded the campaign .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the whi@@ st@@ ine town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property is based .
the New Yor@@ kers with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a lot in the wine village at the wine Road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants place is about -@@ zig corner with it is related .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Palat@@ ine : Donald Tr@@ ump , who was in election mode again .
the town of Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers look over his goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that is somehow exciting , but in their K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter way they are not so deeply impressed , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del .
native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous lo@@ ess@@ lings , at which Tr@@ ump also boasts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to Word - so with the testimony that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
it didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the heart .
although there is no respect of the performance of the family , though , however , you remember that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a bit of great la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt , lies in the circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the investors , she says .
separ@@ ations come from the village of the investors .
the o@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grand si@@ re went out and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the estate company had first plot in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : your wish to return to the country , failed by the Bavarian state to which the Palat@@ inate was in back .
he did not take Tr@@ ump , because he was stor@@ med without hom@@ olog@@ ation , had said the Director of the Institute for Con@@ clu@@ e History and People &apos;s History , Roland Paul .
tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal out@@ hi@@ kers . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ ate statements of the estate .
he had repeatedly spoken of Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and requested the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; like pol@@ arity , it is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a native @-@ called tr@@ ump ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , &quot; the Op@@ a was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; ) .
the conqu@@ ers in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so sin@@ hum@@ erous . &quot;
does it believe that Tr@@ ump happens now ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never takes care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension in Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm menti@@ ons like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz , near a visit to the Church of the Church , donated something that was generally good .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that by the Donald , &quot; the 68 year @-@ old says .
they don &apos;t find it better if he won &apos;t gain the choice , because &quot; that has such a radical criticism , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
if those who had the sake of his grandfather in the United States in the US would have been like him , &quot; would he never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ sh@@ to@@ wing Sarah Bü@@ hler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;

at least one fifth of its surface must be reported as a protective zone .
Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take the loss of leadership in the Today show
Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson face to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the Today &apos;s ratings .
the breakfast show from Nine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ key created the Fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the facil@@ it@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , put in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this dis@@ advantage of the uprising seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , because Sun@@ rise reaches 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five capit@@ als compared to Today 39@@ ,000 .
today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3.000 ) .
Today has closed the gap to sunrise in recent months .
in August Today , Today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .

this is the most interesting thing , what happens every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning more than the Parliament !

the great new Seven words in the Seven words were the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ ous of Italy to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thomson .
the new drama on a recent father , who decides to settle down with their two children at the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics asked how Thomson could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening responded with &quot; Yes &quot; clear . &quot;
the X @-@ factor of seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and sm@@ ashed its block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .

the first half @-@ hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moderate by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe created an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13,000 ) .

the final three vote : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery reveals ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have possibly made un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly obviously who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at Sam Wood ends in the Bachelor &apos;s degree , was placed in the largest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and there will be no one of the three remaining girls will certainly not give , whether it is the one that the last rose has received .
but when we checked with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows each day before you checked out , you possibly acci@@ dentally gave a hint on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood is holding his lips up to the final on Thursday
all three women met ly@@ rical flights , why wood is the perfect man and called his mind for hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values , and positive attitude as a reason why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who would receive the last Rose ? , &quot; could their answers become a player to kill who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except itself - Mack@@ ay as best partner in Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a single relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought that it was pretty compatible throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on the ground , it makes so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the home visit last week you made clear that Wood &quot; could be One &quot; .
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m already subject to him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked who should choose Wood , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the bach@@ elor &apos;s will be aired on Wednesday , 7 : 30 p.m. on top of Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent en@@ quiries to their impressive service at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some co@@ aches have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a pit@@ cher at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and Hay@@ ne gave the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return , and even in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies ahead of the rest of the team , he encouraged her to grin@@ d her .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne public in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ geb@@ Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ hey , who advised him to forget his pat@@ ted catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is pregnant with a pun@@ t who was born in the first quarter of Minnesota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start to appeal the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian success for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble Mountains and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could imagine no worse start in his N@@ FL career .
&quot; it was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne told .
Hay@@ er missed the shar@@ pen@@ er with his original debut at that time in 2007 when a pass at its own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
nevertheless , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

party and leader Hubert ai@@ w@@ anger warned at the beginning of the FW @-@ aut@@ um Day in big wall@@ might before a severe crisis in Bay@@ erns schools , if there is at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools in front of the coll@@ ision , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; otherwise we will get understanding in the Bavarian Education System . &quot;
the public feed of the free voters is t@@ opped up until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
different main topics were actually intended .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum is applied , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
Ai@@ w@@ anger requested the organization of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , just as it did during the late 1990s during the Yugoslavia .
&quot; it &apos;s not the way , we have to focus on the causes , &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate @-@ chief .
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to transfer the free voters as soon as possible .
therefore Ai@@ w@@ anger demanded more staff for the administrative , which are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
for several states , the FW boss critic@@ ised that several states are not consistently elabor@@ ate : &quot; we would a strong unified policy of federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria sho@@ ves off , others do not . &quot;
&quot; we need to be more powerful . &quot;
but the state policy in big wall@@ ets should not fall under the table .
a year @-@ long contin@@ ual day remains on the agenda : the image policy .
for the new school year , Master @-@ Finance Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot trial &quot; mid@@ level plus &quot; with which an extension of the gym@@ nasium has been tested three to four years - in the result it will be nine years back to high school .
but the Ai@@ w@@ anger does not work far enough .
&quot; the topic of the G9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW boss .
we call for freedom of voting for all gymna@@ stics , which they want .
free travel at the G9 anywhere , where it is desired .

4 people killed after police shoot g@@ ums in Nepal on demonstr@@ ators
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after police g@@ mig@@ ra@@ des in a crowd of crowd , demonstr@@ ating the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu City .
Bis@@ hn@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ian D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Executive officials , said that there were more than 1,000 protest@@ ers outside a police station , some of them threw stones and inc@@ endi@@ ary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police have deployed tram as used and then shot in the air before it ra@@ ges on g@@ ums .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber g@@ mig@@ ra@@ des , of which , is known to be able to kill , but they traditionally used as less deadly alternative , obviously a high death rate produced .
the con@@ frontation was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces formed in the framework of the proposed new constitution would decrease their political influence .
there were also protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that want to own a state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were engaged in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10 .
he was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in Provin@@ ces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal known for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature made this week through certain cl@@ auses in the conflict in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution might come into force on Sunday .

Google will start dou@@ bling cash campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign that aims to provide 11 million US $ for humanitarian organizations that would help thousands of refugees trying to flee the European nations as they flee from war torn and poverty .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of donations in his blog .
rather than letting the announcement make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant who had fled with her family from Kabul , is her personal experiences .
&quot; for our trip there were many dark rail@@ ways and bus@@ h@@ ings , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants in Europe has grown in Europe , many people as my family are desper@@ ate for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally accumulated donations up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / , would be dou@@ bling to € 11 million .
Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

reporting from Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easily overweight , diabe@@ tics can be helpful in weight loss surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if slightly overweight people with diabetes based on weight loss surgery is longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the death @-@ specific data needs a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery which wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weights - loss of weight operations or adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ surgery , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and lim@@ bs the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ surgical procedures have proven to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were conducted in humans diagnosed with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are regarded as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers manufactured from Tai@@ ji@@ an min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compared two types of obesity - gast@@ ric acid and gast@@ ric cardi@@ ology - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI of those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI remained among those who did not support surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , diagnosed with 36 % of the diabetes disorder totally and at 28 % .
in the medic@@ ally @-@ treated group it disin@@ t@@ egr@@ ated completely only by one percent , and in some only about two percent .
in addition , the results were performed with the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyceri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors got out .
the researchers also supervised the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held below 7 percent , writing the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; glyc@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as retro@@ spec@@ tively reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality rates in five years , according as Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also el@@ ves average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and had larger decl@@ ines in BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ angle of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of severe people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to obesity people who under@@ go an obesity treatment , about 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soo@@ thing for people with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without higher risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight serious when the patient reaches its BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we &apos;re waiting for a long time , until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , your bodies are connected with obesity and diabetes , recur@@ ring is really difficult . &quot;

so in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
in addition , the novel should be particularly interesting for H@@ uns@@ ett@@ er readers , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe cannot record all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lie .
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to end violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the lasting refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama for Comp@@ assion , which is devoted to ethics @-@ studies .
he demanded that , under the circumstances , the interests of humanity would appear before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also emphas@@ ized that the reaction of the West European countries ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
even though the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts were engaged with the imp@@ lication of the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for which Muslim countries can be created , &quot; he stressed .
ultimately , we have to think about how the kill@@ ings in their countries is reduced .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these issues , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented also George Bush &apos;s actions after the terror attacks of September 11 and explained that the USA violent response was a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he fixed violence , and that has brought unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four @-@ fold increase of disinf@@ ect@@ ants caused by children over the past 4 years
tox@@ ins in the US reports about an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years which are strongly alcoholic , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants increased in children under 12 years to report le@@ thal control centres , from 3,@@ 256 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are more often more common to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go out in the emergency department , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children could drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant , while some do it to im@@ press their friends , or because of a lock in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ant are to drink only because of an inexpensive experience .
teenagers have reportedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol and alcohol to obtain harder alcohol .
younger children can be s@@ lu@@ red by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ ading .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with strawberry , grapes and orange scent , which are very pleasing to children .
Hän@@ dis@@ disinf@@ ection may contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to the alcohol pois@@ oning especially with children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the emergence centre at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not make a si@@ p whis@@ key , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four spra@@ yer of after strawberry as du@@ de disinf@@ ection in school , was brought into an emergency treatment .
her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold of those legally considered to be dr@@ un@@ ken by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated them at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah re@@ alis@@ es her words and was unable to go as they arrived in the emergency department .
doctors found them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit his head , saying Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , and N@@ ha@@ i@@ asser@@ s mother , CNN .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has advised parents and teachers to use non@@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ aries to store and hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
alcoholic tox@@ ic@@ ation were also associated with deaths related to deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants that ab@@ stain@@ ed a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suggest that the product me@@ thanol contained a fatal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students enrolled in the fourth class in New York City to forget her &quot; sec@@ urely &quot; teachers by rolling anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against disinf@@ ect@@ ant @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant and banned them from their room .
the police concerned the promised plan as &quot; creature &quot; and inter@@ disciplinary measures to the school authority .

why I am an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a bit later , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in an on@@ look@@ er gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was first mentioned in January of his best friend , and although I sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day approached , I began to be afraid .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available as places to decide who choose to choose who is chosen .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
he who is selected is ob@@ sc@@ ure it an em@@ otive tablet .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will be sitting next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , which I have developed my own relationship over the course of the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to me to record a notebook &amp; a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remind me of all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ part@@ isan on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained to her by her .
she acknowledged that she could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she still thinks she &apos;s wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I have spoken and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I have told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks he will help the public relations work on the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter for the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of Podcasts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say security that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese accused him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ally of action .
but I believe that there is a strong li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood , that it is not guilty of murder .
I believe it is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from that perspective I shall see him die .
I can not say objec@@ tively to be objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters , where you can contact them .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man resulting from unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police ch@@ ase ch@@ ase persu@@ ades , coming from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked the man of the C@@ anning River .
a man &apos;s attempt to hanging over the police was successful when he was in a shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few metres from a police officers , who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
C@@ anning V@@ ale &apos;s police has been sum@@ mon@@ ed on Tuesday to peace in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when she discovered the suspect , he was trying to escape in the C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; I come not out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his uniform , so he turned out a reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; Senior Serge@@ ant M@@ le@@ dine said .
Master @-@ Football player Ben Cou@@ sins provides an unforgettable example .
in 2006 Cou@@ sins launched his car in the dit@@ ch to escape from a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .
his efforts have been un@@ successful , but inspired by locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben cou@@ sins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards attempted to sp@@ atter him and threat@@ ens to end racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria decided to install a spy on his st@@ ables every year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he led the ste@@ wards and the integration department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they launched a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment last on Wednesday , the last stro@@ ll@@ s on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said to Fair@@ fax Media that he is always trying to do what is best suited to race sport and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it went about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ feeling sample of Li@@ dar@@ i that he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months for es@@ pi@@ on@@ age alleg@@ ations and did not want it to look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long been sitting on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .
they know there is going on .
sometimes you re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said .
I &apos;ll go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to w@@ ander around the head , and I want my owners think that I try my best to do .
if she start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach .
I must consider what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had uploaded the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ o Department had attempted to intensi@@ fy its stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I &apos;m going to be asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com .
apparently , I believe that I am an embar@@ rass@@ ing .
if that is the case , they certainly should hold on their n@@ oses because , when trying to express myself , they have failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , re@@ ig@@ ning President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ un@@ dry , are now aware of the time and are still today .
should I think that &apos;s what you think is going on in person ?
has the RV@@ L make itself strong and perhaps people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the sector ?
am I so bad for the sector ?
maybe people think out there , that I am there .
maybe they must take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is thinking about it right now .
but now I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and pushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the cop@@ ic levels of the train@@ ers have assembled at the long lasting cob@@ alt @-@ investigation at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to that he said that he could &apos; throw &apos; his license above the table .
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the raw Master Black ca@@ viar , described the race @-@ day treatment course &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied on the horse made , which viol@@ ates the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
I have to take up the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my colleagues had wr@@ ongly applied mud on the leg .
it could have been that night .
it could have been so yesterday throughout the day , which was so .
but it had so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment using the pack on the racing day . an inquiry of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need the rules , but here we go too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .
man on driver cur@@ ls are arrested

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats competing for alleg@@ ations made of ring w@@ rest@@ les
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ized the &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites by the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee will have the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring competition &quot; with his team during the high Storm International qualifying finals in Sydney , Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a little hidden note about the Storm team , after his team had made the Final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday nights . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland had not &quot; too good &quot; in the w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ending the attack in his team and said that they are only concentr@@ ating on their &quot; contact &quot; in the tac@@ kling line .
Bell@@ amy was that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers on his team agree with it , as it means that they were worried they were worried about the Storm team .
&quot; it &apos;s up always up - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ ers when they left us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything from our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks , we made our contact with tac@@ kles for a real focus and that made us the trend turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not acc@@ ust@@ omed to lose it so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny as it appears again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy &apos;s idea has got up the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and remember his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ys St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring football club . &quot;
Wayne talks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a bill of divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and take a look at it exciting , in particular its young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play if you have this type of gam@@ bl@@ ers .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried , to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it went to Big Games .
Bell@@ amy demonstrated that the game was induced by Roo@@ ster as a higher result , than the game Bron@@ cos against Co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos probably was a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks out and are not a point of cl@@ amping ?
for me we are the game plans .
when we mention ourselves , we will be able to meet them again in a phase .
the Storm team are free at this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start next Tuesday morning .
ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit according to drug @-@ an@@ ism
a man who may potentially have a lifetime punishment because of his attempt to get to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that had been struck by Queensland , was released on a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of the drug on the yacht , who arrived from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he mar@@ ched his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial deal of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argu@@ ed that it was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
during the pen@@ al case , he lied to the police about his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics Mother and step@@ father had proposed a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release .
&quot; according to reading the ins@@ ati@@ al explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Judge P@@ agan .
but this alone will not be sufficient to stop him , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ ides his Australian and his Serbian Pass at the police , and with@@ holds himself to a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ oph@@ ile to the end of pictures
one female speaker used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl when I slept , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , of which he received a number of un@@ decent photos of children who were sent to him from another user .
the girl woke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the sleeping H@@ og@@ g &apos;s hand .
she saw it , and found the conf@@ using news and al@@ ar@@ ming her mother immediately .
the police took care of , and saw the five images , analysed the computer , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; Web research , searching for searching for in@@ consistent pictures of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ og@@ g then claimed that he would have done so , since there was to be &quot; p@@ ant@@ oph@@ ile in the Internet &quot; and then he &quot; was there to be a polic@@ eman &quot; to sc@@ are them . &quot;
the state lawyer E@@ ili@@ dh Robertson told the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a su@@ p that he is addic@@ tive to people .
he answered that the search were carried out on the computer from him , but said it was to happen because he ass@@ ailed him to be a polic@@ eman , to sc@@ are ma@@ ids .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
he said he was sick of his head when he drinks , and said he would see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson has added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was fasting and with weeping .
she then saw the in@@ contin@@ ual pictures on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused Computer and Playst@@ ation took advantage to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pleaded guilty to the sense of the indictment , to have taken un@@ touched pictures of children on the 14th of June of this year , and did not appear before the court hearing on 24 March this year .
def@@ endant Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g appears not in the register of sexual off@@ s , as one could argue that &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; in his going .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael post@@ pon@@ ed the judgement of October to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted security deposit in this case but was kept for hear@@ ings on some cases occurring in custody .
he was still taken before the date of judgment to the directory of sexual crimes .

Stuttgart : runner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists war@@ n at the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
because of a deep @-@ pressure area across Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , divided by German weather service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the strong depth is the clu@@ stering of the tropical storm &apos; Henry , &quot; who was pulled up over the Atlantic in the past few days .
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are especially anticipated in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , from Thursday morning until Thursday , the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance District with a number of 60 @-@ 90 kilometers per hour is to be calculated .
on Friday , the sun can look back for longer .
the mass makes it : the car looks at the IAA for every two years .
2015 is particularly important in the world &apos;s compact car , that is currently particularly useful .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : roughly 28,@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals were accounted for by the Federal Chanc@@ ell@@ ery ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence Days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , a number of new compact models and luxury cars will be presented by the futur@@ istic concept cars and luxury cars .
one of the greatest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
he belongs to the core of the brand .
with this the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra is also not much more expensive for it .
Opel presents an entrance to the largest competition VW Golf in a prospec@@ t of 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra are available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse dies@@ els additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp to which also feature three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is only one @-@ five .
the second variant will be made in spring of the station w@@ agon , which is already visible at the IAA ( International Motor Show ) .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA ( Show ) for a new compact drive ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ powered vehicle .
the Mé@@ gan@@ e fair is available only in a five @-@ door car in a conventional and st@@ ressing sporty GT version .
in the trade he enters the beginning next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ branch wants to find its position in the growing segment with the new model .
the compact infin@@ iti is fully integrated into the brand line of the brand , with its curved cut lines .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in offer , however , a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine with an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed , however , is the compact design model DS 4 that is shown at the IAA Motor Show .
outside , the designer of the noble Citroën @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ er laid hands on the front part : the radiator grill is newly drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology was equipped .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play has been integrated .
on the IAA ( IAA ) in the compact class , there is a series of over@@ work and new variants such as the resulting Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are human @-@ worthy
as a det@@ ain@@ ee of the Federal Constitutional Court , the Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to use the Te@@ gel pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which was placed in a small cell .
due to the injury of their human rights , in@@ mates were eligible for financial compensation if they are contained in small cells .
this decision adopted the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
those affected can therefore even hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
in doing so , an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe . he was placed in the Berlin Te@@ gel pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meters floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who had been transferred to a bigger cell after the out@@ crop of his estate , was buried in a bigger cell .
his ministry is due to the un@@ question@@ able detention conditions against the State of Berlin .
but the Constitutional Judge raised the judgement of the Berlin Chamber of Chamber Berlin and refused to return the case .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even though j@@ uri@@ dical reasons only had a few days of detention for the compensation , there was a compensation , the same name was .
otherwise , &quot; a wor@@ sen@@ ing of the legal protection of personality is to fear . &quot;
the chamber decision must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the constitu@@ tions in the past have already strengthened the rights of prisoners .
so they only said in April of in@@ mate damage , because he was imprisoned in a prison cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision from 2011 to also the multi @-@ fold pressure of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , on Wednesday , in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , having a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parall@@ el@@ incident in November 2009 , had agreed a decent living room .
this then @-@ man pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was found in an same cell within three months from 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Kar@@ ls @-@ back .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also occurred in the head@@ lines for the last few weeks .
prisoners are kept shut up within 23 hours , aggressi@@ veness , even to temples , is said to have already passed because of the stra@@ ined location .
according to the Court of Justice , 21 are not occupied in Te@@ gel for their lack of young groups , 19 are to drop out 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are making the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are expected to come to Germany by the Federal Ministry of Germany this year , according to the Vice @-@ President Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take one million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrates the challenges of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we create it . &quot;
what is coming to Germany , con@@ veys the following overview .
it is necessary to take to various forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( by the Pest@@ el Institute ) apartments every year - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space but above all at affordable rental objects : annually 16@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing come out of the rental rate , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments will also apply refugees .
state Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
so far too little is that from the perspective of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to arise and therefore the Federal Government needs to grant € 6,4 billion per year .
in addition , scientists and the Federal State Council agree that there must also be more tax advantages to investment in residential construction .
based on estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Voc@@ ational Research , 55 per cent of those of refuge in Germany can be employed .
however , refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically in their qualification in order to help them in the starting level , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but it is crucial for the integration of refugees , but they find work in Germany .
let &apos;s work be the key to social contacts , for appreciation of the admission fee , but also for self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to thr@@ al@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around in Germany : the labour banned for refugees for the recognition of work .
while there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the resi@@ den@@ ess of asylum seek@@ ers .
in society itself - even because of the lack of maturity - mainly the visibility is ensured that refugees ought to be able to make access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German .
there has so far no exclusive offer in general and business @-@ related language courses .
research also shows that work@@ places are largely medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore , according to the view of thr@@ ott@@ le , the Royal way towards working integration .
the Berlin school government has found that only a few refuge parents guide their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the root @-@ root parents , it is only once very important to hold the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Cos@@ petro@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration hand@@ outs included in different languages .
if needed by the large number of refugees strongly increased by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the educational capacities - for instance by more specialized schools .
in the countries school students are prepared in the lessons of welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by full @-@ educated teachers , but as in Berlin , also from teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of lack , evidence from the Berlin school government .
the German student body estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Federal State asylum seek@@ ers or thought did not say - the only exception was Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ er Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has given up his attitude now .
while studying , the access to the university could be facil@@ itated .
for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce have not received any benefits after asylum seek@@ ers , if they begin studying .
the latter will generally receive no B@@ af@@ ö@@ g because they are not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ög@@ less persons .
Ged@@ ali@@ ated refugees have had to have lived four years in Germany in order to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ G @-@ entitled , from January 1 , 2016 , this span is shortened to 15 months .
but these funding gap must be concluded , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Stud@@ ents &apos; project .
the students should immediately get b@@ ump health .
Islam will in future play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is the most important part of their identity .
the state should domin@@ ate the same rights in Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches will continue to develop a new state @-@ religions @-@ ratio .
the creation of an Islamic welfare state is important to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers to the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights also belong to the rights .
thus the representatives of Islam must be a clear contact person , and willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and to create some control options .
there was also the read@@ iness to act on religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed his concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
those who wanted to escape such conflicts in Germany would immediately &quot; have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will in future be a lot more than a topic of society .
as a result , the majority of ownership will have to change as a result of a reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a decade of anti @-@ discrimination laws and a General Gender Equality Act .
but it is very slow to learn how the NSU @-@ folders showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and advoc@@ acy groups were committed to Germany for a long time and for why international agreements shall be under@@ going reality in the coming years , when the country will remain peace@@ fully and its new citizens should benefit from their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany has been able to provide medical attention to the previously expected refugees , &quot; says Mr. Frank Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
as for Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we establish , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel impres@@ sively .
however , additional money must be flowing into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery demands opportunity to present all of the trav@@ ellers with the registration of health cards .
subsequently , services could be reck@@ oned with the federal states later .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to see so many people with the limited number of services to see the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , the doctors do particularly make the language bar@@ riers .
as early as before , the Berlin Ministry of Health , The@@ a Bor@@ de , has proven to be aware of the disease worse than other patients .
if not only in clinics , also medical surg@@ eries had to be assumed , they are demanding .
also , many refugees had been assisted in emergency patients in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic ga@@ ze .
amongst young people , there are much more untreated disability , and with the young people it is about HIV clari@@ fication .
however , with the aspects of other diseases , German doctors from their education , however , says Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite in@@ fest@@ ation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize , &quot; and as regards the aid of doctors , possibly by the refugees or even alle@@ vi@@ ation in sight .
the Syrians would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees ought to be physicians .
in order to practice , however , they would have to re@@ sign their quali@@ fications , and possibly decrease the ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to the Federal Patent Act ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) : most of them suffer from trau@@ matic stress problems or from depression .
especially viol@@ ate the young children , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains the president of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent survey of TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugees escap@@ es trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
anyone who has been diagnosed on a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress error is suffering from the so @-@ called Flash@@ back with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart attacks and fat@@ alities .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentration problems , strong fear and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , early treatment may be necessary , Mun@@ z stated .
so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees get a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social em@@ bed , however the processing usually takes several months .
in addition , non @-@ resident or doctors , who are not trained in psychological illness , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ jud@@ ging , says Mun@@ z .

Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mug@@ abe holds a false speech in Parliament
Mr Mug@@ abe , African &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year .
he was im@@ pover@@ ished , but the video of the case arose quickly via the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by the claims of dep@@ uties of the Opposition , that they have received anonymous death threats and warned them against to accompany the speech by Mr Mug@@ abe .
last month , they had hidden it and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opponents have received SMS messages on their cell phones which they warned against Mr. Mug@@ ab@@ al &apos;s talk .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said to journalists at Mug@@ dis@@ es . &quot;
they warns against the members of the European Parliament that the immun@@ ity ends in parliament , and as soon as they leave the parliament , its parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .
the leader , who testified by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard moves up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in line with restructuring and savings enabled by the company &apos;s services .
in this year , HP will split into two listed companies and split the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing corporate hardware and service operations .
the expected number of jobs led to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in a statement .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive which should slide the unit upon separation .
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is smaller and more focused on HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ening portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual sales and is expected to provide un@@ reach , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; so an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in order to produce electrical equipment and the Palo Alto garage is &quot; the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has consistently run a massive restructuring , to manage the conversion of traditional PCs towards mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that the focus companies are focused on a better performance .
FC arsen@@ al Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate lie in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere has to stand
Wen@@ ger shown to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation should go according to plan , there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas .
this optimi@@ stic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss the next four matches for England and , in view of its history , its stake in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace at this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , that healed not well .
it is not a bigger matter .
this was just an accident .
it wasn &apos;t in connection with his kn@@ uck@@ les or with the injuries , which he had previously had .
this may be true from purely medical perspective , but such as Wen@@ ger even recognized , there is the corresponding risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd submitted 23 different cases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere &apos;s premi@@ ums six years ago .
he also played in only 65 from Arsen@@ as 157 Lig@@ a@@ iel@@ en in the last five hours of play .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight players since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier@@ ship Clubs have been one of the two major league clubs .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but arsen@@ al believe that an improvement in the risk of physical in the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you return from an injury , you have a more acci@@ dental period of time in which you must strengthen your body and win fight power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career out of the type he deserves .
Arsenal started his Champions League @-@ season at Wednesday night against din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on coming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger is presenting a rotation within the teams .
tro@@ op@@ ard Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveling to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will begin to start in Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ c@@ ott .
&quot; I try to maintain the balance and the players who need it to indul@@ ge a small break @-@ break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although Arsenal are clear favour@@ ites to continue by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the slots with the highest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started in the last season .
on Tuesday evening , the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake which was indicted on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal had moved the apprentices@@ hip out of the past season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and ab@@ orted from far hope , with his management to lead the club to its first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; he said .
it has never worked for arsen@@ al .
we were very close to the year 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in the shop to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship Day : the Com@@ edy Show that gave us a serious lessons about male friends
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open , now more desper@@ ate than ever become , as suicide rates among young men can prove on a 15 @-@ year @-@ guide .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged from 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it stays more frequently in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ de ( CA@@ LM ) has announced the year &apos;s Camp@@ a@@ ign against a her@@ b@@ ular life ) 2015 than the year of the man to question the culture in question that men are prevented from searching for them if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the battle to master this challenge .
a current study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with major depres@@ sive symptoms realized that when the suff@@ erer had enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; doubled the chances of recovery .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circuit of mentally healthy friends are cut the risks of mental problems .
however , of course , one has to once even have friends so that friendship can work .
in the age of more than social media , communication with its focus on style upon substance is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , liv@@ able and effec@@ tual , doubled , even if the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists have expressed ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , everything on costs in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects your mental health much more deeply .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can &apos;t really buy money .
the beauty of friends was that this focusing system was put on his head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ined by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ugs , moments at football look in cozy sc@@ are and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can depend on any case , even if they are often back to explore fully their feelings .
as a employee of the phone trade declared it to me : ... &quot; my phone role in people who feel de@@ pressed and vulnerable to me , really demonstrated to me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
the old phr@@ asing &quot; I come to righ@@ tly &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , when you talk about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes in mind , when I try to offer long @-@ term regulatory mechanisms .
they clearly present the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much of my objective out@@ si@@ der status via phone the people in sight of desp@@ air also may help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend of Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you want to sit around in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ festiv@@ ity
di Maria meets , to help PS@@ G to help home Mal@@ mo
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh in Cav@@ ani after his hits vs Malmö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malmö .
here are the play report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh , held in Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season , with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the stadium stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts , as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion to the way , but afterwards they missed it a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani recorded a head of head at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ oc@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A we needed a strong start to the Swedish master , since they are not only seeking the qualification for the K.@@ Reg@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class@@ room of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ s &apos;s team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics missed opportunities in front of the gate . he became later in the game against his home @-@ home team and against the club , with which he began his lively career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to look back to our opponents and to look back even if there are certain things we have to have been perfect during the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; that is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we have won , although I am sorry that we did not have scored one or two other gates . &quot;
according to his injury in one of three changes to the Paris @-@ Team , Mus@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris @-@ Team on the weekend , but he was able to hold his own seat against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stung by Paul Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian gul@@ li@@ man was named as the man who took over the PS@@ G over the next month in Manchester , when he entered the final month of Manchester United States when he entered Professor Marco Sch@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass beyond the Malmö @-@ Defence , before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of our multilingual network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would get a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off , to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine National players on the field and was with a five @-@ man @-@ defence and two deep in the middle of a big opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed away from Kevin Tra@@ ci@@ on in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little effort .
instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself up , with some mis@@ mis@@ ses and bad offspring , not least from Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic who , with no less than five attempts , was in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had installed him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass from Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria was transformed into a turning point , who was sun@@ k by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute of the pole ...
the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus scored his six season , after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had spotted a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
this all thought that Mal@@ mo could go back to the game , and just an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz before the substitute of the E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi was the end of the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian news : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level .
the qualifying games do not submit . &quot;
hat off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on playing diversity in movie film
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ formed the af@@ ro@@ american film@@ makers Eff@@ ie Brown on a discussion about the diversity and said she &apos;s not needed behind the scenes .
while a result of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light dis@@ rup@@ ted the experienced actor Brown as this stressed the need of alternative perspectives , referring to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , you do it with the cast of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; Gener@@ ate Dam@@ on .
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , ins@@ ulated Un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian settled .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer of producing Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ thing brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to try people to think about it - whoever will always be the director , &quot; says Brown first .
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line that is defeated by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People settled for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to film ; Dam@@ on answered that direction &apos; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion has been broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded dis@@ approval on Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Ms Mr Po@@ oni expressed its rage over the clip by saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - this is SO KNOW that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the site served more than 5,000 re@@ ar@@ ets and 4,000 liqu@@ eurs since its release .
Dam@@ on comments are at a time when the precise r@@ att@@ ing representation in media at the head of social discussion stands .
after the teenage father of Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Movement of Black lives suffered a nationwide effect and urged the legisl@@ ature and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices .
in February , the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums silent , &quot; ( albums are still their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums are still their importance .

&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport climbing and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete who won the American nin@@ ja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Price of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who could shoot all stages of his obst@@ acle course .
during seasonal harvest there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the finals .
the last task assigned to climbing a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten ended the task of the time with which he finished the first ath@@ lete who finished the st@@ ress@@ ful Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge three seconds faster which made him victory .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fighting victory , still under shock over the winning of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 or more , &quot; Isaac E ! about his hor@@ des money .
so suddenly .. I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course of the course , did not earn any prize money .
according to the rules , money is going to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it &apos;s one of the fastest time , &quot; We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , it receives the great horror .
I don &apos;t think he would cher@@ ish a Gro@@ ll .
he is just so happy having done what he has done .
he received awards of awards earned by fans .
it is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I am happy that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt equally as having sw@@ apped the roles .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for a season season , which will begin work in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers entered from Minnesota T@@ wins over
MIN@@ N@@ EA@@ PA@@ N The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once again they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly with Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins took an opportunity to climb up with Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , though only for a night , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so hard to hold about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all the victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ ser@@ us .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support for Detroit three times in the first two routes , then once in the sixth and then once in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 interior and gave three of us possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end up this year , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw in bull@@ do@@ zers for every game , and therefore I want to go in to the game .
the designated tiger @-@ ho@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since then he had four hits against the Seattle navy on July 6 .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung well the whi@@ pped wood , &quot; said the algorithm .
he looked good at ( bu@@ zz@@ ling ) , looked clearly better from the bull@@ sho@@ ots , and he brought it right into the game .
with three rings at the back of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had the best chance to get back into the game again .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished recording with a double in the left wing line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colourful , and Simon launched his second B@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man who was faced with whom he was confron@@ ted , before the design@@ ate ro@@ ok@@ ie @-@ kn@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , which was released by the right @-@ handed b@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen on a two @-@ Run .
with a pair of buyers and the end @-@ Run in the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen offered the third b@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe at a double play .
it was the major league &apos;s list for the 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe got a double play .
after Detroit added a fan @-@ run at the end of the ninth down , we went into a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed pr@@ one shows S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for the fifth grade .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the adv@@ ent of the game by an unprecedented Phil Hug@@ hes .
the Tig@@ ers delivered three rings in the first two routes against the right @-@ handed @-@ veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game of the injury of the po@@ aching area , after he had paid more than a month &apos;s suff@@ erers .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished me , &quot; Hug@@ hes said , &quot; but I felt worse than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches since the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the first Le@@ ad@@ off batt@@ les@@ hip , there was one single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game that hit a single &apos; up the middle &apos; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the runner @-@ up in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third b@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , as he did the threat .
the tig@@ ers were set in second , generated by a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ osis for a 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he was not particularly well beaten , but he got the right spot .
Hug@@ hes was located in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the relie@@ ver right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
with Hug@@ hes there came to three hits with six hits and a walk with four sn@@ ke@@ outs .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal Sanchez was the case of an injury to the litter concentration .
it was investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who was working from Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , since the middle of August , in the middle of the po@@ aching part because of a shoulder line , it is intended to activate the Sanchez .
with Sanchez C@@ d out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is deleted from the injuries table to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 in four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has stra@@ cted since 20 August due to a force in the right thigh .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end up their series of three games at the target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is used against Minnesota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees ought to be in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night at Wednesday .
in this respect , people are expected to be housed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city was traveling on Tuesday night .
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 million refugees .
several sporting halls of the Hisp@@ anic state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees may temporarily wait there .
they are then to spread on other municipalities .
in the past ten days , after indications of the government officials responsible for the first up , having arrived 7@@ 500 people in Hessen .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up a large number of refugees in Spor@@ th@@ aller because of the great refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria a option
the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; I believe that the thou@@ ght@@ ful thinking about military action options may not occur without Germany , &quot; he said .
he j@@ umped to the European states &quot; collective directions . &quot;
four years ago , we were happy that the cup of military involvement in Germany has passed .
&quot; now the conflict lies in front of our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington urged for a massive rise to international assistance on site for refugees .
Austria controlled in southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again adopted inspec@@ tions on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister for the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on the Austrian TV station on Tuesday , and now nobody will be sk@@ ill@@ fully sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , it &apos;s been agreed , &quot; she explained .
on the question of an agreement to which Germany could take a certain number of refugees from Austria each day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the General Director General of Public Safety and Represent@@ atives .
concrete figures did not refer to them and rejected talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the last days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria for the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
your goal is usually Germany .
Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit in cooperation with several European governments and heads of government next week .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have not committed itself to a common approach in the crisis so far .
the interior ministers will want to take a new starting line for another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee cluster in Germany , the federal government wants to support the country to become the first and distribution of human beings .
this alliance will manage this together with the countries , announced on the late Tuesday night following almost four @-@ month consultancy with the Prime Minister in Berlin &apos;s Chanc@@ ell@@ ery .
Merkel under@@ cut those people who would need to protect themselves .
but those who have no lead @-@ perspective , can not remain in Germany either .
this view was de@@ pressed in the turn .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor has stressed the state as a whole , now has to overcome an &quot; huge effort . &quot;
in the meantime , thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are stuck at the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometers long border in Serbia at night .
a few hours later the government announced that Hungary had to sail a fence with a fence .
this neighbouring country is elsewhere from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary needs to prevent tugs of extin@@ ction via Romania , Hungarian Secretary of Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said to the planned new border .
the Romanian government condemned the Plan to be promp@@ tly .
there were first ar@@ rests of people having passed the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of migrants lost their way to the Greek border .
ocean View &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
on the day of Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us s@@ app@@ te a global ocean .
these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i . &quot;
according to the moon , the moon goes easily on its path to ring the ring plan@@ ets .
this diving movement is only small , but still too large for a continuous sky@@ di@@ ous body , it is called the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers presented their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cap .
so in 2006 , &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of Saturn , which sp@@ ells the water vap@@ or and iron particles and thus the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of the Saturn .
at least at the South Pole , there should be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed it back then .
but the extent of the hidden ocean was not cleared .
Rama , 1860 München several weeks
in 1860 , about one month on the open territory , Val@@ det Rama had to aband@@ on Rama .
an investigation issued an investigation on the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , distributed to the association .
Rama had already wa@@ iled through pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich , the diagnosis is expected to break four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult for us , Rama is a her@@ ent loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we must re@@ think now , &quot; says Sports Manager Nec@@ ess@@ ay@@ n in the &quot; Image . &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential obligation of a united professionals .
the six@@ ties presented a de@@ def@@ ensive , however , as training g@@ ast .
the 30 year old H@@ r@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was in use in Belgium and earlier has already been under the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
the Kro@@ es currently have &quot; the ability to establish his skill . &quot;
Tor@@ ch Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training after his occupation of the week .
even on Thursday the Austrian National Player is to upgrade into running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had viol@@ ated itself in the game in Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) with a heavy mer@@ ging of bru@@ ises at his head .
contrary to first fears , however , he remained without a serious bl@@ ing@@ orship .
no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention on its slender , often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
the Mang@@ os contain relatively high sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
the exotic fruits are still healthy : in them B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. primarily contain man@@ gan@@ os , but vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta car@@ otene .
who eats the fruits , therefore , support sight , immune systems , and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when buying man@@ go , man@@ os should not be too soft or hard to smell .
the form@@ work color alone doesn &apos;t say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ gan@@ os can taste delicious .
they should be kept at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste with pure or in sweet foods .
there is also sa@@ vory food , a special note .
she mild and mild bitter tastes of man@@ holes like ch@@ ore@@ es and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Mang@@ och@@ ut@@ neys is perfect for fish , poultry , lamb and game .

on Wednesday and in the night for th@@ urs@@ days the fö@@ hn takes part in part with the pe@@ eler pe@@ eler .
after gro@@ unding on Thursday morning , we cross a striking cold front that brings strong rain falls , wind turbines and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure border over the British Is@@ les in a powerful sp@@ ar flow .
at the Alpine site , one night breaks through the valleys in the night .
as a result of the hair @-@ dryer to Thursday morning the hair gro@@ oming in the gro@@ oming industry with bows 60 to 100 km / h , partly isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land , partly with more than 100 km / h .

Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square in Rome .
in presence of the president Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino in the presence of a previously prestigious place in the park on the O@@ io Hill , the name of the German Stru@@ c@@ ator was baptized .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now acknowle@@ dging the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; .
the park is located right in the middle of Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was applied to the work community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Protestant Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded that protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were able to live only in secret with their faith .
with the place , in symbo@@ lic@@ ally , it is evident that the tradition of Christian religion is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered a young August@@ ine fri@@ ght around the year 1510 / 11 some months in Rome .
he emp@@ ath@@ ed the city at that time a lost sin .
his negative impressions let him em@@ bol@@ ted him in his later battle against Rome in his future battle .
Luther was then initiated by his thes@@ es against the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the Western Church .
Hammer artists invested three years into the Bible &apos;s personal interpretation
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works which Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and explained the Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Testament that now appeared with splendid pictures .
in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has prec@@ eded his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and screen in 150 moti@@ ves .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means in@@ significant is with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can certainly be quite dark .
around three years Ot@@ mar successfully worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has hit a sub@@ jective @-@ artistic selection from the many theme of the &quot; Book of All books . &quot;
created are cycles that dev@@ ote topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or father@@ hood .
he spont@@ aneously said several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler Publishing House with his focus on art books .
and this is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who set up on the basis of painting with the particular Bible places .
he transl@@ ates the Bible verses of Ot@@ mar Alt , and today into today , translated into current connections . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
it is embedded in the original Bible address of Martin Luther and a proposition of the artist who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden spoon .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to have twice a deep insight into his soul , its emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
ultimately , emotions had been a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Old , born 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler of the Order .
&quot; it happened once again with the cane , &quot; resem@@ bles Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern was to re @-@ establish the art in faster time again : &quot; the perception of imag@@ inations is influenced by advertisement , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed .
artists have a different desire and del@@ ights to show things .
pictures are always curious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Gold@@ means , &quot; let the viewer enter the pictures , &quot; let them appear , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost started his presentation at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on Tuesday at the presentation of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like what he understands of his images . &quot;
old did not care to compreh@@ end the Bible completely , but also selected for him most important , mysterious subjects .
&quot; it was not a collaboration on the eye level , &quot; says Shi@@ me@@ ost : &quot; it &apos;s about the images that explains the text . &quot; a picture of a picture was created .
for Hans Mö@@ hler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
one part of the origin@@ als - paper and sheets - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition presenting the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway
plans were made , place found , company commissioned to model@@ ed a circuit for a circuit : one year later , almost anything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was over .
con@@ veying in politics and administration enabled for cast iron , especially among the people who did not toler@@ ate the railway .
so hill deported , new space sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
permission to go back in October , the first joint project in Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock was able to communicate in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; I hope that this year has yet happened yet , &quot; she said .
it should be started without &quot; additional mem@@ orandum &quot; when working with the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees to 2019 , and the Bundesliga was a distinct sign on the weekend .
football re@@ acts to Germany and sec@@ ures the political situation in Germany and sec@@ ures his help by managing the upcoming problems .
&quot; I hold this for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can tell . &quot; no one can tell . that doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; it needs to be interested in each individual , this theme in the handle &apos; , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to possess the refugee situation in Germany inten@@ sively .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State for Mrs Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ lu and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; there will surely be a central role here , &quot; he announced .
the football can help and wool will help .
the decisive moves must , however , constitute the policy .
the German National So@@ ccer Federation has therefore expanded its youth initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ dian @-@ Braun Stiftung we ensured that this program continues to continue until 2019 , &quot; Mr Wol@@ s@@ bach , on the outskirts of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some Federal officials support this program .
as early as this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ized a clear sign , if they don &apos;t help to wear the &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the otherwise noted Spon@@ sor@@ rows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want all to help out where and how they can only &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sporting chair Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler and questioned the project as &quot; Self @-@ intel@@ li@@ vity . &quot;
&quot; refugee &apos;s gri@@ ev@@ ant goes to everybody , nobody can be seen . &quot;
&quot; we can use soccer players , no , we have to use our jet fuel , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have been so incredible to help , &quot; Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ heim Chief Executive Director Peter Re@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the national team .
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large common association with German football . &quot;
for every 36 license agreements that have launched their own projects would be great .
it is equally great that small and smallest clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome , &quot; which we spent is playing in football .
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will jointly publish 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; the clubs have also called the whole world for 2015 , &quot; says K@@ id@@ s@@ bach .
reports : SAP managing director lost an eye with an accident
the board of executives of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reportedly lost sight to several reports by a fall in July .
after the accident on the staircase of his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he was dropped by midnight on a water glass , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost immort@@ al , he was power@@ less , got out to@@ wed in the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; says the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could work with his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet before the Supervisory session at Wal@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; full @-@ fit . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; South German newspaper &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , and will return to Germany again in October and continue the software revenue .
&quot; I am full of SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I stood at regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t generally comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since summer it was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him who had such personal history to the public , said the Manager of the S@@ Z : &quot; to anyone can happen that something . &quot;
&quot; it is important to get up again if you have fallen . &quot;
McLaren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ m@@ ish ...

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes of a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us won their first group play in the Europe League .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the soccer league in the Du@@ el with the F@@ k Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we can &apos;t go back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B Coach is open : &quot; we expect return from it to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ or position only in the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change to the door@@ ke@@ el position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking place in place of a tender branch Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises at an absolute top level , &quot; praised the world champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is going to play in all Europe @-@ League games , however , Tu@@ ch@@ el left out openly .
with high probability , it will also dispute the second game .
the leading statement of players re@@ us , that the final withdrawal for the B@@ V@@ B should be the destination for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League , writes the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for re@@ tra@@ c@@ table : &quot; that &apos;s not that wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to retri@@ eve the title . &quot;
robot cars : government wants a pioneering role in Germany
in Germany , according to the will , the Federal Government will be on the way of being technological promin@@ ence .
the Federal kab@@ in@@ ett was set up on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Transport Finance Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which amongst other things can be seen in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday at the edge of the Auto Show in Frankfurt from a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
the automated and net@@ worked driving will increase the road safety and provide less steel , &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt said .
he also plans to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G7 countries , which also come together with representatives of the industry .
the strategic writing of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , amongst others , st@@ resses the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and an increase in digital radio stations .
testing new technology is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
to ensure the driver &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; be raised , &quot; the German government intends to examine the legal framework conditions &quot; and , where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
for example , Germany aims to raise some international information that the permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also plans to deplo@@ y an amendment to the Vienna Convention ( which only sees people as a driver so far ) .
in addition , in increasing driving , the car will take over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that process the surroundings and process the data in seconds .
according to a study published by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the automated driving of motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
nevertheless , driving vehicles in public roads are expected to be expected until 2020 . &quot;
value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving feature in Germany , the authors of the study estimate that by 2025 will be roughly 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency over road traffic , &quot; says the SPD traffic officer S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l .
the question of liability upon accidents and safety of personal data in the driver must be clari@@ fied clearly .
but the Germans think of self @-@ prop@@ elled cars , however - much more than French or Americans .
one on the AA pre @-@ authorized survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ator DE@@ K@@ RA is said to have shown that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surveyed by 2025 can expect aut@@ on@@ ome of driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
following a survey of the digit@@ ally canc@@ eling machine , only seven percent would agree to cover control during the entire drive on all roads .
on the free@@ way the flu@@ ent traffic could still be 15 percent , while St@@ au 45 percent .
almost every fourth would leave the car to control under any circumstances .
b@@ oll says Team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to current status , Düsseldorf plans to action night only in single action from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision should fall by September 22 at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge sl@@ ant for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it every morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to bring with Timo &apos;s title , &quot; Jörg Z@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , in Düsseldorf , during the EM @-@ teacher &apos;s course in Düsseldorf .

&quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer a clear Favor@@ it , &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j O@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ ist in Ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , remembered the European Championship in 2013 .
&quot; at that time , Timo had also fallen , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the world @-@ ranked @-@ fifth .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a great fashion show and an ax@@ e @-@ game gr@@ ate phone : the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which can be frigh@@ tening thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer who , among other things , with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skirts .
&quot; I can &apos;t say that today I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was easy , in the meantime , it was genuine , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from 18 September at the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer his ment@@ oring had changed his person in the beginning .
he was , however , always been : &quot; for me it sounded a sort of death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been at the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; he said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it &apos;s about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into which barely out@@ performed works of the man , who has written fashion history , has ever completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed universal artwork , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ ying the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist is engaged for example .
14 tons of material have handled the cre@@ ators according to the curator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , in Munich .
just prior to the start of the October Festival there was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather watch@@ dog out@@ fit with cor@@ sa@@ ett .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier says .
G@@ aul &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is also shown in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , tender and fashionable walking attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and badly in football ) he was clothed his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , Gaul@@ tier says .
with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
he taught the dis@@ card of fashion later .
he st@@ ole clothing inscri@@ ptions and saw the designs of other designers , as Gaul@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought it later .
for his first own fashion show he cannot pay the models .
they got nothing , but allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of S@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
previously it was going to make long stick@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen therefore to make a metre .
for example , the embro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and peaks were made in large amounts of customers , for example , to ceilings and she@@ er curtains .
today , the company does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the E@@ quest@@ rian Sport Team .
instead , fashion is important .
in the early times of the lace top fashion played a larger role , and was pushed into the home textile industry - and now being re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt is called some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and with regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion show that le@@ aning on the past pins , an increasing contractor .
who has no niche form in the textile sector in Germany , is no longer available on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
screw Point Pl@@ auen is part of nine further companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener and Em@@ bro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they may carry out the protected label .
over the past 15 years , 80 percent of the turnover has been dis@@ continued .
there are almost no private shops and wholesale stores .
our products hardly achieve the customer in this way .
today , mass goods are generally cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively via chains .
also exports are to export , currently to Russia and in the United States .
so sufficient reasons for new routes .
the industry association is also attempted to points through environmental awareness like C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embro@@ ider@@ y region in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been producing a quality seal , which shows that we can produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger outdoor tax of the western Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ y and tips .
in order to op@@ pose the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
a conflict between the bu@@ zz@@ ing ideas of designers and factories , which need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design is often only easily varied to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ formed the historical snow line .
for this , the machine turns on some places small ch@@ icks .
the au@@ sp@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ dd@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ge was inspired by this : &quot; before that time I couldn &apos;t start with traditional pl@@ ung@@ ers . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ tip for their jewellery .
in an elabor@@ ate procedure she defines the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies us to Australia , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers who have lived their ancestors in pl@@ auen and surroundings , who want to be a mem@@ ento .
this makes my ornam@@ ent as a modern amb@@ ass@@ adors of the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip .
Disney plans to launch new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie

according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; it is not about a re@@ marriage but a kind of sequ@@ el , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magic children &apos;s girl .
it is about the experience of N@@ ann@@ ie with the family Ban@@ ks in the times of the world economic crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years to Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
but the director is still standing : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; in the cinema .
XI p@@ ushes to open the economy bro@@ ader for the world
the economy must bro@@ ader wider extern@@ ally , in order to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping is responsible on Tuesday for a group that was contra@@ cted with the steering .
&quot; China should apply to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business activities , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
promote new curse and reforms reforms , introducing new moment@@ um and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the guide Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity part of the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policies , con@@ veying of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the resident @-@ mel@@ ts system .
according to the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified , which are not candidates for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of significance , as it promotes the market a larger role in the allocation of resources , which is a legally univers@@ ally approved business field , and the statement said .
the government also checks the inspec@@ tions on those transferred to the company , and to make sure that companies decide how to carry out their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow China border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border business operation and new mechanisms towards promoting regional growth .
within an offer , state controlled sectors open , other areas are open to private investments .
&quot; the government will not change their policy towards foreign investment and will protect the lawful interests of foreign financial companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement .
moreover , fore@@ igner , it is easier for foreigners buying a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; , by optimised the application and facil@@ it@@ ates the application process .
the right of attor@@ neys to guarantee their work , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leader such as Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli were part of the meeting , as reported in an explanation published in the conference .
EU aims to double the mercury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and consumers in order to make a significantly higher dose of the patient .
the F@@ ood@@ watch Consumer Organization , which is a reasonable tool for the EU , critic@@ ised the plans in sharp : &quot; risks and side effects failed industrial and environmental policy are filled with impact of pregnant women and small children , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is to ensure the limit values of the ne@@ ural she@@ ar for large fish at the end of the food chain like Hai@@ fa or S@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish already are so strongly bur@@ dened with mercury that , based on the still existing limits , approximately 50 per cent of the length should not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be available .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU aims to contam@@ inate the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 mg to 1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch therefore described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because small cem@@ y@@ fish , such as car@@ p in mostly as low , are so low that they already hold the planned figures already today .
the lowering of a cl@@ ergy is , therefore , &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des indul@@ g@@ ent man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy &quot; , says Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metall , which , primarily en@@ rich@@ ly applied to the food chain , particularly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; only minor amounts can cause particularly un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry on its website in terms of applicable maximum values , however , is that an &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population &quot; may not be expected .
mercury is mainly through the coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written document by the German Federal Ministry of Finance , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ ke ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total volume issued in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish is approximately in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube , &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; the Spiegel had quoted in March out of paper .
in the past year , war@@ nings of mercury in fish already included the most commonly reported health risks in the R@@ AS@@ FF @-@ warning system .
