Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendship .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing activities in the Middle East .
however , at the meeting , there should be a conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ member solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ sion@@ ed for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the constant settlement of Israel and raises the imp@@ lications of the peace process .
the deal of the Iranian nuclear programme , by Obama , has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , Netanyahu had kept a controversial address to the U.S. Congress held by the U.S. Congress , which was rated as an aff@@ r@@ ont to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had refused to refer to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , his girl@@ friend said to have shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told me with a somewhat ch@@ itt@@ led voice of the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officers had to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; but still live and possibly been excited , and he said the family contacts made the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss and a handwritten note that was critic@@ ized on a white block , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I loved it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved Me . &quot; this was according to the information of the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that lamb , who had travelled into two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed by the police according to the police .
Delta State University Police Sh@@ eri@@ ff Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ itäts @-@ Emplo@@ ye@@ es have heard around 10 : 18 .
he said , Lamb susp@@ ects the cat@@ astro@@ phic emergency call sometime later .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took up life when the police settled him .
a day after shooting in the University , students and teachers are forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to pro@@ claim a picture of what lamb is motivated .
the details that were published by the agents at the two ends of the state were details , such as those who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where he died , said he didn &apos;t have a history of violence or criminal record .
father himself had mentioned lamb in a written book , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both in the department of social sciences and history , which includes 17 members , attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some in@@ clin@@ ations on problem@@ atic behavior .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised lamb , said he was also a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had told stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any problem for health reasons .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the university means that the promotion , for the lamb had worked so hard for , would not provide a guarant@@ e@@ eing for an automatic way for a presentation as Assistant Professor of Assistant .
Home President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions which lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , police later found Lam@@ bs towards Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as again .
before he was arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house approximately one mile south of his parents @-@ house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why they went to the house , but Johnson said they knew that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb first grew up in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he graduated in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs called him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 years and he was 20 when they met together with shared friends .
they and their friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her guitar .
he was the morning of women at the time .
all girls melted away when he was there , &quot; said J@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
lamb and p@@ ad@@ get were apparently some time together .
in the emergency call , Lamb , &quot; I had killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which is ad@@ ored to a Ba@@ you at G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends were left and a daughter who had been 19 years old now .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that lamb were interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ un@@ ce when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up for three years ago , both on a summer @-@ year @-@ old market .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ ree was a nurse , which worked online for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit night near G@@ auti@@ er , said he saw lamb and Pr@@ p@@ iss Night at night 5 September for the last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ious asp@@ asp@@ ar in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that something was not right .
he just said , &quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were on the evacu@@ ate and hear each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense for she@@ ar .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester programme and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas , and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle @-@ light commemorative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the wake @-@ up , while the university entrance &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; sang .
the classes will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to rev@@ iled by saying that the police have shot the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ ent@@ ree indeed as his wife , but there is no indication that these two have ever been married .

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was notable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater wait for the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is empty before me , and it becomes very clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;

8 re@@ frac@@ tion@@ ed values show that Donald Tr@@ ump sum seriously .
some have attempted to brand it as a flop .
others tried it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump down from top R@@ ul@@ ls at the p@@ olls , it didn &apos;t work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask yourself what it means for the odds of nom@@ ination of real estate gu@@ arding .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys had left the lead of the asc@@ ending Herman Cain , none of them won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bus &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative business Group Club for Growth can now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps through sever@@ ance and start raising its dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current res@@ oun@@ ding values that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps Belie@@ fs have turned around 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July , there were 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view from Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have negative opinions .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa last week noticed that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters were happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CNN / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they would &quot; be angry &quot; if he would be the candidate .
just Ben Car@@ son puts about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent , they would be &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same above Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican elec@@ tors say they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; off@@ ended &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be a candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump so@@ thin for his bom@@ b@@ astic and ins@@ ulting declar@@ ations , 52 per cent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul says the real temper@@ ament for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first election state of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has a chief commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 % think that he did not have the personality to effectively manage office , and nearly six out of 10 independent ans say that his temper@@ ament was not p@@ low into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get acc@@ ust@@ omed to the idea .
when they set up their schol@@ ar , Republican elec@@ tors Tr@@ ump is real .
if you are asked who will win the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee on the final week , CNN / OR@@ C will say four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time , when four out of ten ends their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
but it shows that a large number of GO@@ P voters will see Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible milit@@ arily .
even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump takes almost everyone .
some experts refer to that the frag@@ mented field probably contributes to tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is diff@@ us@@ ingly distributed over a dozen other Can@@ didate .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , tr@@ ump support the majority support .
he before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take entrepren@@ eur 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head racing .
a suc@@ cin@@ ct majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have made their opinion .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , say that they have forgiven their voices .
of course , it can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never to change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made their opinion , are twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump on immigration .
since then Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign led by immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ist , &quot; the Immig@@ ration and Angel@@ ika was in the public dis@@ course on 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic ac@@ credit@@ ation of tr@@ ump @-@ critical Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republican Party and the re @-@ orient@@ eering efforts are damaged .
but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump on issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration stops in the lim@@ el@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump appears to do so also .
the fru@@ stration over the government clim@@ bs to new high@@ s .
by now on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , more than half of Republican elec@@ tors , especially by its out@@ si@@ der status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than somebody with government experience .
and they are also ang@@ ered at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent , &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five Exclu@@ siv residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany
here in the Hob@@ mos@@ ken@@ weg path , the most expensive residence - overlooking the North Sea cloud .
in the street there is a square meter space on average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it is in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows in which particular locations costs a square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top residential neighbor@@ hoods , one of the price comes before .
the real estate provider angel &amp; company has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter , well @-@ noted .

Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream boots up to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two times of go@@ al@@ sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a race .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller made the way to FC Bayern the way for a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then she ran .
a lively event of the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze signed a dream start@@ up in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; from Pi@@ raeus , Germany .
the team of trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to tr@@ ash double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Göt@@ z hits ( 8 . 9 ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth Star@@ ter@@ fol@@ g in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally get the h@@ enk@@ el@@ t@@ ote to Munich in the third stop .
Müller came to the Champions League on his 28 match in the Champions League on the Bavaria @-@ based release of Olympic Tor@@ wart Roberto , who managed to pass as a fl@@ atter@@ ned shot of the World Champion .
&quot; we won &apos;t like to under@@ estimate it , &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp lam@@ m promised before the play at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the award @-@ winning languages .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated presentation , without spar@@ kle .
Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six hom@@ est@@ games in the Premiere League , among them prestigious clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled .
but the Bavaria , once defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be next victims .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , with their adv@@ ent efforts often and often imagin@@ ative .
the attacks were often led to the out@@ lay on the heading of the Costa Blanca , which was rare against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck than his fl@@ ank from the right hemisphere in the left upper chamber .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski &apos;s best occasions had the best occasions .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye took the head@@ ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct dial , the Tor@@ wart Roberto prepared with his knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bavaria reg@@ ained its acc@@ ust@@ omed game , it could set up Pi@@ raeus &apos;s N@@ adel@@ ou@@ che .
but on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel New was Ver@@ let .
thus , as he drew a shot from ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to New A@@ aba , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a quad@@ ru@@ ple with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat down outdoors .
the World Cup hero was not given until after the closing of the green light , Sport@@ sman Matthias Sam@@ mer said on &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to do something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the eliminated Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
it arrived late to Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , the El@@ f@@ meter sat another one .
before the game , it was in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of foreign @-@ stor@@ med Bavaria @-@ fans in their audience block apparently prov@@ oked the followers of host Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with impact drivers against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
at least a Bavaria @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
anyone smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
he who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that &apos;s a way of Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study near .
the good news : when ren@@ unci@@ ation decreases , the risk is rapidly .
smoking permitted a clearly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
the long @-@ term study of an international research team emerged , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to qu@@ itting smoking , smoking lay the risk of losing their teeth time , in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ che .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of dental bal@@ ances include cav@@ ities , inflammation of the g@@ ing@@ ival tissue , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore go back to frequent g@@ ing@@ itis in smokers .
don &apos;t be clari@@ fied , smoking is also increased the risk of c@@ aries .
people who heard from smoking , however , could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could however last for ten years until the endang@@ ering was back on the level of qu@@ itting smoking , the first author Thomas Dietrich , written by the English University of Birmingham .
it must be persu@@ aded to be non @-@ smoking , pre@@ sidents H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking permitted the life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and j@@ ars and leads to our knowledge as well as to good dental health until the high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of dent@@ ures are affected , the DI@@ f@@ E shared with .
earlier studies have already been noted that smoking rises the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ p@@ ates the findings .

EU Commission proposes the TT@@ IP new court in dispute
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ral tribunal resol@@ ute over the scheduled trans@@ atl@@ antic trade agreement TT@@ IP proposed by the EU Commission .
the controversial private shel@@ ters for disp@@ utes between concert and states must therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which is considerably more traditional dishes in its operation .
&quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizen , &quot; said the representative of Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström &apos;s commitment .
the Swe@@ din had to launch the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade negotiations with the United States .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is supposed to develop the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings cont@@ ested that the EU states and the U.S. will jointly choose independent judges for a new sub@@ sid@@ y courtyard .
they are intended to stem from the EU , the US , and third @-@ countries .
the first instance is also scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to lock up objec@@ tions .
so far , the rules agreed to refer@@ ee to refer@@ ee , a claim against their judgments .
in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in Fair@@ ness and Justice , commented on Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , she wants to work on an international investment contract .
there could be clari@@ fied disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU states there , for example .
the investor @-@ Sta@@ ys @-@ Ar@@ bit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) was regarded as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against the TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ers are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parall@@ el@@ ance , via the company damage to the tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws or decrease consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the EU Commission as in@@ adequate .

delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage at the Kölner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
in addition to it , a fli@@ p@@ chart showing the very shy fol@@ ks@@ um of the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan associated with felt @-@ tip pen .
the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by the Stev@@ ens lecture .
he tells of different places that he always records back on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and tender arranged songs .
where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , Stev@@ ens has been wonder@@ fully creative g@@ ther .
&quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan &quot; published in 2003 and their third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear clever songs that gr@@ asp@@ ire very close to American folk music of the late six@@ ties , but could drift at any time .
it is the report , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a prolifer@@ ative series : each of the 50 US states should be discussed in a row .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; appeared and thus breaking through certain expectations .
Stev@@ ens come up here .

a year later , the musicians return to the series New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens In@@ v@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The F@@ oise &quot; ) is published in 2005 .

the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual rank@@ ings of the influential music media .
Stev@@ ens reli@@ es on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) as an extensive electronic sales catalog .
this sixth ordinary studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated but of programming sequences or beats , and plays with all the effect and Hall .
long ago the smaller clubs got off , the bus@@ h@@ ens@@ ho@@ ws are drawn here to the colourful spectac@@ le of ne@@ on @-@ forehead @-@ head@@ bands and large fli@@ ud@@ ent stages of stage .
currently , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens travelled as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .

although there are almost 2000 guests going to sit inside their chairs , the much more mature Stev@@ ens back to in@@ tim@@ acy and to folk .
without being a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician with the wide @-@ excited album .
you can hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can &quot; throw away the &quot; sla@@ b in the valley . &quot;
just adding to an allowance of Stev@@ ens , Stev@@ ens has more older songs and finally per@@ ver@@ ts among the appl@@ ause .
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns in the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has made an exciting debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire .
the new Socialist leader , Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , is supposed to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire and took place for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to mid@@ day for the first of his six given questions , whereby his performance of the media is likely to be reviewed by the media and the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p several sessions to give her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , as she comes to a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ let in his appointment and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour chairman , on Tuesday during the sin@@ ing of the National hy@@ mn with a commem@@ oration ceremony of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises the number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the heart of several cover @-@ pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision , not singing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention ...
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had stood &quot; in respec@@ tful st@@ illness , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; Hel@@ pen@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told in the BBC two News@@ night programme , he advised the Labour Group to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in economics , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him as leader .
the political correspon@@ dent in BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political dis@@ agreements are also st@@ aff@@ ed within Labour &quot; by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &quot; as well as Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the restriction .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference , that Labour changes to the whole idea of a limitation in total .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pensions , Mr Smith said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that they have only to cut against the government plans , to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour leader , which David Cameron , since he has been Chief of T@@ ory leader , has passed over the dispute over the last decade .
the Labour Party , promised with a different policies , says he had given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr. Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 ideas .
Is@@ lington North MP said that the questionnaire of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ational , and that he will under@@ go both the impact and dispute with the resistance of resistance , and instead carrying out serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic female secretary , is represented if he does not take part - for example if Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spread the word , and that he said John Ber@@ lac , the spokes@@ man of the home house , to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was able to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; which often is concerned with the questionnaire of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he admitted that he has failed .
when she first aired in television in 1990 , the questionnaire became the most important barometer of a leader and his position in the lower house and his position among his par@@ liament@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed , they have become a caric@@ ature and require a sufficient reforms .

Met@@ res starts soil distribution campaign for com@@ b@@ ating al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A branches in front of a Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has started a ground@@ breaking campaign launched in order to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , rein@@ force Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets promote their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A through ma@@ instream marketing and marketing concerning social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A res@@ eller and suppliers start aboard , with brands such as ice manufacturers Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distri@@ butes samples and shop@@ keeper who sell tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will be publishing more details of his defense strategy on 29 September when whol@@ es@@ aler being tra@@ der for food , alcohol and devices lead to his annual investors strategy .
it is much on the game because South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shop shops and generating higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts at Morgan Stanley said that Al@@ di will take five percent of the food market for twelve months after opening his first markets in these two states and will take on all existing actors , but mainly independent individual tra@@ ders sales .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley was estimated that IG@@ A @-@ retailers could lose 360 million revenues per year and $ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate sales of 500 million $ and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in the food and grocery store and the quantities on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high control base could cost around 13 million $ a profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan took out that IG@@ A purch@@ aser is the closest rival .
Morgan Stanley is taking action that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall by 4.1 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , talked about business in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash is likely to van@@ ish within a decade .
Met@@ res , it refused to respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash has been incorporated in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and food trade , which has fallen around 1,200 IG@@ A @-@ reta@@ iler since 2012 , has fallen by 43 percent , reflecting its operating debt reduction in turnover and mar@@ gins .
the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers wa@@ it@@ ates itself and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to attack selling prices with Col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and improve IG@@ A retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s major managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says the pricing and shop rehabilitation programs will become embar@@ r@@ assed and hopes that whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis band Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise than criticism for his behavior .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves recognition as the President of the Australian tennis hall Steve He@@ aly rather praise than criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; , was passing through the not@@ orious passage from Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati soon , co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the refer@@ ee , whereby Harrison cried : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to beat fellow , and I should propose the child . &quot;
as he was last seen , as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp@@ f became a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ defended by He@@ aly .
the teen is currently at Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth on the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I aw@@ ned myself , is the fact that after my view , Than@@ asi was a little in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken up a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a cr@@ ater to the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken up a bat with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well into the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so on , and I think he ear@@ ns much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around himself , and I believe he was a little to be treated strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never been a problem with the other players he is training hard , he is well in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ved it to be judged according to his own services .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take the Kyr@@ gios at the important pre @-@ decision not to take into account the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long lasting firm to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we want the team completely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ versy surrounding &#91; C@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe Nick has made a very quick ascent , what people like Feder@@ er and Murray are pointed out . he is rising in the eyes of the public , but we try to support him who can only think it &apos;s reasonable , and it is best for him , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , close to the border , with@@ holds refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and war the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted the Serbian officials .
the people who escaped from violence were on the road for an unknown time in a country strip at the street between the two controls of the states and built their tents , and settled there .
but fru@@ strations went on board .
as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and shou@@ ting ins@@ ults against Hungarian dep@@ loy@@ ments .
some refused to protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; that migrants should be sent back from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a collabor@@ ative harm .
there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended one day after the 28 @-@ nation @-@ block at a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels could not agree any common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40.000 people who had sought refuge in shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would say that the EU states would continue to accommodate more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a temporary action of Brussels or its neighbors .
the ambul@@ ance issued on Tuesday in two southern regions the authorities issued more powers to overcome the crisis , so that they could accelerate high@@ ways and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Secretary of Foreign Affairs , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also had the construction of a bar@@ bed wire to Romania in order to stop the stream of migrants through the country - after it had ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisoners in the racing running the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in recent months , Hungary has become a number of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war@@ ships which are entitled to protection - a view that strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in force , make the crossing of the border , or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ ur@@ us to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also put up pen@@ alties for condem@@ ning traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government proclaimed the state of emergency , &quot; said government officials Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ers in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the military use of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters of Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed troops with vehicles and dogs on day .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security adviser to Or@@ ban , said that there were 45 people attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others were dr@@ illed into the country .
they come over by damage the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of crimes by off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are able to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos was surrounded by the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and put a crowd in order to push yourself there .
about 20 succeeded to arrive , but thousands remained outside .
a further group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are travelling to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ ander in a national pol@@ l
the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continue to hold a double @-@ digit lead in democratic race to nom@@ ination at national level , but sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders win its opposite to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters for the previous sel@@ ections ( 58 per cent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is at second , with 27 percent increase ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t announced his presidential election , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters for the presidential election .
more than five months before the start of the election , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is established , which candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more stable than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a series of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders achieved some profits .
Clinton keeps a big advantage in women and slaughter , but these jumps have reduced .
your support for men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is lying here only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has fallen away , and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton had a wide advantage with the older elec@@ tors .
last month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit advantage over the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the nationwide referendum would say that they would support him with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with several rights and 15 percent would only support them because they are the can@@ did@@ acy .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current support is all of her enthusi@@ ast@@ ically .
the views are stronger with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ ast@@ ically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they must support Clinton with enthusiasm , they say less republi@@ can vote on their nick@@ name Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters in an open question is asked why they want the can@@ did@@ acy , the most common answer is that she is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that a woman is set ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval to dealing with problems and voters are also quoted .
since the vice @-@ president acc@@ uses a potential for the presidential election , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see it in the race - although one third believes it should not do it .
when democratic voters are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is on top .
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far before S@@ anders .
decides not to match the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , it raises Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters will see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election ; however , this number has declined from 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second with this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; chosen &quot; is risen .
yet , on the question of what a candidate is more important , Democratic voters call questions about the voters .
similarly , in the last month , no one democr@@ at@@ ical candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ tors of the presidential elections appear as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate or potential Can@@ didates bring good results in some important characteristics of the party &apos;s sel@@ ections .
consider Hillary Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
in the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the lead in hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say the above S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinions of him .
Democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters did not have any opinion from S@@ anders .
because questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server time of server will continue to be made as Secretary of State , most of the Democratic voters are happy with the matter of the matter and say that their opinions has not affected their opinions .
but there is another story in the American public .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most of the Americans said that the email contro@@ versy had no impact on its general opinion of Clinton , though 36 percent said that their opinion still deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , over six of 10 who say that their views from Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , it will continue to have a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voters do not hold them for honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the nation &apos;s voting rights are un@@ honest and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump receives good notes in the lead .
of the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush were best amongst hon@@ esty .
a majority sees itself rather than hon@@ estly , but like Car@@ son , many have no opinion about him .
the error rate for the sample rate of 351 Democratic voters at the preliminary election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves near to a survey conducted by Donald Tr@@ ump on the national survey
Ben Car@@ son is located close behind Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s latest survey conducted by C@@ BS News / New York Times
at the two candidates , half of the voters pay in the new survey , and others are losing dramatically .
Republican elec@@ torate continues to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before the Fox News debate in the past month to 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the pol@@ l also showed that Car@@ son sur@@ passes well in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ pass tr@@ ump among Republican majority .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio - Governor John Kas@@ ich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins , Scott Walker , who fell in the deepest , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida governor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio have 6 % on the third place .
the error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republican elec@@ torate in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was performed in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son is growing in the p@@ olls - it ends 19 % support with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the pump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed Tr@@ ump clear before Car@@ son .
with a view to the Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side symbols for the former neuro@@ surgery , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ um@@ ps faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said on Saturday last Saturday during a campaign performances in Io@@ wa .

five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened by the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student was filed during a sch@@ ik@@ an@@ ous rit@@ ual as a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder will be filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood called Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during one entry of execution as in September 2013 and delayed its transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said that he had been loaded with associated eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while trying to step into a frozen field on a finish .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about heada@@ ches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood called not the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ fully power@@ fully and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to change his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ mark Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the property began to hide and presented the well@@ being of the Brotherhood provided by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ mark Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force of injuries to head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family . &quot;
brothers and their members need to be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe , issued an indictment for murder of third @-@ degree order for the first five members .
two @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with anti @-@ religious attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the Brotherhood has contradic@@ ted its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest
an interest rate increase , and the house will fall into the flan@@ ks , return for bonds , and the economy will lead into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know , how long will it take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history for the economy is just a small guide to the exp@@ iry date .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising the interest rates is often , even though not always , a factor in what economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have strongly emphas@@ ized that investors should not focus on it when they start to increase the interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables are playing a role .
at the end , market participants could notice that the whole excitement is possibly exagger@@ ated due to an interest rate of interest .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inv@@ ari@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message of customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest at normal heights , but still on a low level to enhance the seis@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historical trends , as some areas of the economy could react :
as seen in the market last month , the advance of interest rate of interest takes place for a while .
once the increase hits , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delay in monetary policy reflects , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analy@@ sts in a recent study , what happens according to the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is generally rising in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate of interest rate , fairly flat within the last six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis that Bob D@@ oll , chief system strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks will occur later in enh@@ ancing cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed confron@@ ts with some conditions which had not existed before and that could accelerate the recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , with the 118 C@@ advert@@ ised threats , the nominal GDP is less than 4.5 percent since 1950 .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few that this would run and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the terms of the Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest rates with such a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throwing the question , &quot; if this time is different , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants enjoyed the whole year on an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could prove an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study all enh@@ ancements have taken place from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing vibrations while GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ ession@@ aire can be set very quickly after the start of recovery in the sha@@ dows , &quot; says the report .
unlike this , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession observed in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest serving the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and this has been 74 months .
the solid income also was vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market increased a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if those change their strategic course .
as a result , the yields seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / lowering in the cycle is carried out .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in the interest rates will lead to bring back the gap between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a decrease of the curve .
highly @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although we are still very c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ al@@ yst@@ in at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting that Jones believes the markets have already adjusted expectations at F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the dollar &apos;s force and the drop in inflation , there are some indications that the market has adjusted to a more str@@ ingent policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest have risen , increasing the yield is fl@@ atter , lending ten@@ sion@@ ing have increased , and the volume of vol@@ atility has risen - all features of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in the large and entire company , companies that are un@@ winding the larger part of their business activity in the U.S. will benefit if interest rates will increase and local products are more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debt will be worse , as the dollar is investing their products on the global market more expensive and also financing its debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to respond positively to an initial rate of interest , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs analysts at a report for the customers .
companies with strong balance , companies with weak balance after each of the rate of interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 sur@@ passed the average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low volumes in their shares also sur@@ passed their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
businesses with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock , consumers are also benef@@ iting from the increasing dollar .
spar@@ ks could see gains by higher yields , even if experts in different opinion , how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament director Andrew B@@ ingham
the con@@ serv@@ atives of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for his &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not able to distinguish increasingly from commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she has im@@ itated only The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins won the Voice of The Voice on and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does something that do not do the private channel .
the con@@ serv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham said also to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; ev@@ il@@ ted &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguish from its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 &quot; - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; digest@@ ed &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started in December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seems to be the Br@@ its just under another name .
so , if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples of which you are actually only im@@ itate what is on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
the BBC Director showed his accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to public music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and work on new works , I have really kept for important , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , argu@@ ed that harder to be worked , to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British have less informed about classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , that during the hearing of the committee on the selection of culture , media and sports , under fire , went into the commercial rival to the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins took hold of The Voice on - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show at BBC , bought by Dutch producers Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it isn &apos;t original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - &quot; was produced in a special BBC way . &quot;
he added that he would like to find a hit from our company &apos;s house stable , &quot; if it took the next time in a entertainment series .
however , he ref@@ uses to exclu@@ de the order from further ranks of The Voice in the future or give money to the security professionals for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issues in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into cov@@ eted cities .
but experts say that there are signs now that the online sales stag@@ n@@ ating after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
overall expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are indications that online sales stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for years and up to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian .
he stated that the online sales began more than three years ago , when buyers began to make shopping for their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , such as home on the sofa .
but now that one comm@@ utes itself , and we will probably see that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is quoted as a reason for failure sales .
experts believe that buyers will return their purchases in front of this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers to make their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers were stor@@ med .
experts believe that black Friday could hold off the purch@@ aser for bar@@ gains , buyers who could stop selling buyers .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that 5 £ issues had been issued a little more than £ 1 online .
some products such as TV and washing machines will now be conducted more than one @-@ third of our purchases over web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of man &apos;s clothing and shoes are buying online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner towns .
Muslims are buried in Mec@@ ca for crane accident , Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tion@@ ed
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first lands in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia reli@@ es on the collapse of the giant Bin Laden &apos;s giant Bin Laden .
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed
hundreds of Muslims were gathered as 29 of the victims were worn by the streets to bury the dead who were killed when a crane collapsed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s great mosque .

the mour@@ ession went over to the Holy Place where only days earlier a building crane across the ceiling of the mosque and then r@@ ushed to the concrete .
the bodies were approved for the funeral , when the Saudi @-@ king passed over the construction company bin Laden , because of the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction imposed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 factories , who were killed when a crane collapsed by the Great Central Mos@@ que in Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
under the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram found himself from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who had crashed on his first pilgrimage than the crane collapsed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already announced that the H@@ add@@ sch after Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city will continue .
today , King Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden group would not have to stand the arm of the crane , when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree that was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency in the news agency does not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership will be allowed to travel abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man came to reveal that which caused the overthrow of the crane , which over@@ threw hundreds of thousands of Muslims before the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month , gathered .
the bin Laden group has not published any statements about the collapse of the Kran@@ s , and its representative were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ elled the group because of its current safety measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mos@@ sy part of the massive building plan , led by the bin Laden group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to Saudi Arabia &apos;s mist@@ ress and takes over major construction projects .
the dead leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a heal@@ th@@ ier son who was taken away from the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once a life of any healthy .

B &amp; Q Boss is saying that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British employ more skilled workers , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has a rise behind him
the result is that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are set on professional tra@@ des@@ people , will be opening
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q outlets will close sales nationwide .
by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Brit@@ ons carry out their h@@ ammers and brush in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European tra@@ des@@ people who carry out the works in their home
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush for painting from walls , you apparently belong to a minority .
because British employ more skilled workers to perform DIY jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new director of King@@ fis@@ her , who has the tree @-@ shaped chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , offering services to deep @-@ market prices , is now over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are focused on art@@ is@@ ans and close to 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten Kauf@@ decisions in the shop will hit by women .
at the moment , men were overweight in the men .
she said it was necessary to present the growing demo@@ graphic trends which have more female Single @-@ households that have more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we must move this stronger towards a balance .
in general , half of our clients consists of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in decision making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed , has also inspired their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied just 50 percent of the team with women including its managing director and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher returned to a decline in half @-@ year earnings and par@@ agra@@ phs after the Group had paid the costs for the closing of shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .

the sports officials had been spending only temporary damages and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and had invested in much time and money from the liabilities - the Passi@@ va was approximately 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approximately 4@@ 4,000 € ) in 2001 .
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : &quot; do we continue the club or block us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we had money in advance , put our life insurance than security at the bank , &quot; he said in the receipt .
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money free , it can only be made public .
additionally , at the appropriate financial success , the payout from the conversion compens@@ ations was retro@@ active until 1991 .
as a result , a result of the allowance @-@ related damages occur only years later , namely , from the year 2003 , when an increase in the account has been paid out .
therefore also flat and non @-@ detailed bookings , explained the former stat@@ es@@ man to explain the processes .
the two def@@ endants were administered together , said the second def@@ endant .
why the pay@@ outs have not been revealed in detail , the judge asked .
the Association is not interested in financial planning , it is important for the debt of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 , when there began an emergency investigation into the administration of office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club &apos;s onto .
the def@@ endants had been rep@@ lied , they declared the def@@ endants .
this securities open on the name of the second accused , and , according to the association , was not known .
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted to know the judge .
this did not ask him a long answer .
then he said , he thought he was the best for the club .
if something happened to him , no one would have known something of that money , the prosecutor asked in the room .
the co @-@ compl@@ ained has been informed , the function@@ ary of the function@@ ary .
this transaction was form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation &quot; .
why host@@ ility ? , judge and public prosecutor wanted to know .
the first def@@ endant stated that he was not agree with this formulation , because the association was never a damage .
but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; You are all of you out of the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never had a cent salary , he has only charged mil@@ estones and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he is charged with the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , added .
exact documents for the early years could not prove the def@@ endants .
these are according to an operational test , where everything has been judged correctly , no longer had been kept , they declared .
kilometer had also included the second def@@ endant .
all can be done in cash , in addition , he has to depart from his place of international fair to the Bank of Abi@@ burg , in his statement .
the trial will be continued on September 23 with the hearing of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard stands for more 30.000 jobs
in addition to the first three years of ongoing account@@ ancy , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will build further jobs during the construction of the company .
the positions with the US computer terri@@ fic He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) does not find an end .
within its restructuring , the US technology power@@ house plans to set up a reduction in 25,000 to 30,000 locations in its corporate company .
this means that costs are to be saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion Euros ) , the company distributed on Tuesday .
the step will result in a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , resulting in the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs for the past three years is not yet complete .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP were still around 30@@ 2,000 associates .
listed stock listed the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Share 2.3 % .
with printers from California Palo Alto , California is based on : so the computer and printing business shall be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the future areas of computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be recorded at the stock exchange .
another dis@@ appo@@ inting PC @-@ ship@@ ments as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers according to its services set the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers after the Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of financial year , sales of PC and printers had fallen by 11.5 per cent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus , the revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters were returned .
HP respon@@ ds to a split and massive positions on the transformation in the industry .
the 76 year old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only respon@@ ding to customers to buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and always do more shops equal online .
Whit@@ mans restructuring plans will see a reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs in total .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : Serbian Border ( Serbian @-@ Hungarian border )
the Hungarian police have deployed in the Serbian Border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water ro@@ wer against several hundred attra@@ cting refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violence at the border controls .
he reported to call :
a group of refugees broke out the boundary .
behind the police there was a pol@@ ishing line and behind the police officers , there was a water ro@@ wer .
they began to throw 40 to 50 fug@@ iti@@ ves with stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officers initially set un@@ interrupted pep@@ per@@ al spray .
afterwards , the police used sh@@ ame@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
the group was dis@@ b@@ anded .
the refugees have now been withdrawn from now .
a pregnant and obviously last woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had met the tear @-@ eng@@ as , cried .
other refugees are s@@ add@@ ling in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press secretary of Serbian police suffered severe injury to the use of tear gas and pep@@ per@@ oxide .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
the world observed , if the US monetary bank depends on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision , whether for the first time , the interest has been raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reuters , found that a little more than half , which would do the F@@ ed to do this , now think that the F@@ ed will continue to remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current rate of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will be maintained .
it is a historic event because seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest ended on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach the situation in which a large central bank may aband@@ on the zero area and re@@ launch a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , trillion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less dense outlook on global standards .
she warned the markets to set up an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds are good for such a step .
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
ob@@ sc@@ orer at the Delta State University sum@@ mer@@ ed debt recovery
after shooting and killing of his girl@@ friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to tell him that &quot; he could not do &quot; with the first murder , &quot; he could not make it known , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that lamb , lecturer of ge@@ ography and social education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , He shot up someone and someone killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said &quot; I made my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; was in the house but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; but probably will be excited .
the police asked the call for his name , but he did not stop him .
lamb had no explanation for his kis@@ ses .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ ree , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to do it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , 1,@@ 300 miles sent to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police killed him .
Home President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ p@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said the authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &apos; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ ree was discovered by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married around seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ ate had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the floor . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ p@@ iss have been his daughter , &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ ree worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ p@@ iss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , met with lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said ,
the police said that lamb had addressed a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he is not going into prison . &quot;
when police paid him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , he drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb Lub@@ ri@@ cated from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , awarded a Ph.@@ D. as its lifestyle on the University &apos;s website .

all this is for sure its tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
the Lufthansa is planning a large Group building .
for half a billion euros a year , the Lufthansa Group alone wants to save money with a better organization .
150 of the 1000 executives around the world will cost the job to work .
in the pilot plant there is a new negotiations .
the Lufthansa operates its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the strategic real@@ ignment is an earnings contribution of around 500 million euros a year from cost and sol@@ ving sy@@ ner@@ gies , the airline agreed on Wednesday .
among other things , the Lufthansa there is no longer a board for passenger cars .
the Euro@@ wings budget line should be developed as an autonomous factor for this purpose .
in the board of directors , Carsten Spo@@ hr will be held responsible for Euro@@ wings in future 2010 .
with the re @-@ setting , spo@@ hr emphas@@ izes the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines will operate under the Air@@ line Group &apos;s roof , the three quarters of 2013 annual revenue of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective agreement with the pilot certificate cockpit speakers ( VC ) , negotiations shall be resum@@ ed after the judicial strike on this Thursday .

the conflict between the union and airline airline led to various strikes in recent months .
background is in addition to the trans@@ itional provision of the pilots the austerity concept &quot; Wings . &quot;
it is stipul@@ ated that Lufthansa in the fight against competitive ranges at the Group &apos;s own low @-@ line Euro@@ wings .

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can not play for months due to double fac@@ tions
the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven suffered a double correction of his right buttons .
while this brought to the left @-@ def@@ ending champ@@ ions and shut it out for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not point out the hope that Shaw can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a revers@@ al attack of H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the twenty @-@ year @-@ old Shaw was broken into the PS@@ V range .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has twice a double leg and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then in Manchester operates .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic is happening .
in the changing cabin , he had a oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor but if you have double frac@@ tures , it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and a suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ rators had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a visit to Sha@@ ws account used : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how kap@@ ut I &apos;m , my way to recovery begins now , I come again back . &quot;
referring to : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK def@@ enders has an additional inc@@ entive to recover itself until next June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ o , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; it is a very gri@@ ev@@ ous injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the spot with this kind of injury , all very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ As Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear that it is a very gri@@ ev@@ ous injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; Coc@@ u said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball who had been travelling in another direction , so that it looked like if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad there . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ash by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s one thing that all parents may learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost in@@ wardly .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book was named , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax which was published in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the super camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the subsequent passage , in which Cameron allegedly describes the book of the book , instead , gives a table of the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to see his desire to see a real tree , fulfilled , &quot; reads , a love of love was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage was ho@@ stage and who died in 1991 , but totally unknown .
as if the text is still not suspected : the text of the Lor@@ ax film which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
though he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron doesn &apos;t trust the story of the book as little . here , an un@@ ben@@ evol@@ ve boy , like the local environment through the gel@@ ding Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ wling , schn@@ wei@@ rd being , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; will be rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a helper that has read the Lor@@ ax 20 times behind a child .
a Do@@ wning Street Spe@@ cher@@ in said the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons Elec@@ toral Office .
the super @-@ camps confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons employees was delivered , but there was no other direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was certainly threatened with the exclusion of England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult .
turning to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you have selected the Kad@@ esh , the England for the tour , an repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward win .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not bear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali was a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test @-@ level , is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Ly@@ th leaves out of the England test cad@@ dies and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
to leave the decision Adam Ly@@ th , of course , his principal trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire is difficult to analyze .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are focused on results .
there was no question@@ ing at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this to it - players their own choice .
long ago , the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own destiny .
when coming out hopefully further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance arrives .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss engaged his post@@ ure , even though he didn &apos;t give up so good performance , and that surprised me not ; he is especially a team man .
the question , how much time a test @-@ cat@@ erer has to be , to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on got nine .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance for home and moving .
the only accus@@ ation , which one can raise , was that England was first replaced by Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a b@@ ats@@ man , whom I appreciate high .
he is an X @-@ factor @-@ cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in that season , when he scored 236 seat on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as they get before him , but this depends , of course , from the club position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of going to cook the Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would get an extra @-@ spin dr@@ y@@ ler and got four Qu@@ icks , I caught , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t strike there , and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a v@@ icious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not get his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is there a number 3 for them , and there is no difference .
my early mate team @-@ mate Justin Lang@@ er played his first 38 german tests when he appeared in Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately managed to get three hundred R@@ uns and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Abdul@@ ari comes in the ca@@ des as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he impressed me as a young man .
people possibly see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup co@@ bs that lift their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made some smart supplements by the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ding , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as an advisor for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ion of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes with the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and how Mah@@ ela has insights from which we can profit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously said .
Coll@@ ys Team@@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , root was a similar pause for Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team @-@ makers don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you must remember that , as in players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = Great Britain out of Britain ) could win to Zul@@ u if the economy is held in a spra@@ ying device until 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ ons dis@@ closed re @-@ trial strategy to stop Britain in the EU , even without the choice of the in@@ gen@@ ious Jeremy &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour or the TU@@ C , who suffered severe decline because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at said that some member states , such deeply mi@@ stri@@ pped in various crises such as the EU , and not always from own debt , Britain itself created Agenda with divided conc@@ essions and trou@@ bles@@ tions , which they usually don &apos;t want to be satisfied .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not like it to end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they would win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wants to look for outside Germany at the inside of the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes - &quot; Let &apos;s not look back alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can be seen that more and more short @-@ supervised ministers and civil servants come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we &apos;re staying or going .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years , and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for it as it did in the exagger@@ ated long @-@ range such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a seduc@@ tive force .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a le@@ ft@@ ist .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they are going to break up a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used to prevent from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most of the similar separ@@ at@@ ist ten@@ dencies have to be used .
therefore , some such ministers may not deliberately use hel@@ ical remarks , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s train@@ ee campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , you suspect my friend .
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how breeding the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics did not be the Oli@@ gar@@ chie of the press bar@@ ons in 1975 but not been to support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may remember being weak to Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro Opp@@ ort@@ uni@@ sten , who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s .
with all his ref@@ us@@ ability , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this includes the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ for@@ ged jack@@ ets , telephone @-@ h@@ aul break@@ ers and the pseu@@ do non @-@ cont@@ actors that have most of our big newspapers .
actually , Tony Bla@@ ir thought about it , but noted that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you can get better ban@@ anas to give him away instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ y@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself , but Bla@@ ir had surrendered the principle of the EU , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back@@ door .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he could not have time anymore for me - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yc@@ ott Mur@@ ter &apos;s strategy of 80 @-@ 70 years , a mistake at that time and today .
it may last but he needs to develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns is an official position to Europe - I &apos;ll put it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
now , most people out of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ant Ten@@ dency and the wil@@ der@@ ous Ge@@ ar of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may say everyone to say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary was &quot; a Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in radio and television this week did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ing &apos;s appointment in the prov@@ oking John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father was strug@@ gled with labour on TV , loyal to his Labour cabinet office without going too far and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his co @-@ war and MPs to all the reports on Monday evening .
whatever the touching messenger @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n tell you to remember that he even has touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding home of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right , Cameron doesn &apos;t give free tickets to Europe who allowed him to keep lab@@ ours in the speakers for self @-@ comprehen@@ sion , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic pre@@ am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to the EU membership - in line with her Benn@@ ite exposure @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is not just a matter of the es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son stands firmly convinced that J@@ C will do no campaign for the exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn to political capital - they have also mis@@ chief voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be po@@ int@@ less ?
the USA are already quite disappointed of the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ reduction in the T@@ ory government in power where I was remembered at the start of Monday that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking from a meeting of 12 people , partially with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ise the number of e @-@ cigarettes in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive audit of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have asked the data in@@ qu@@ ery and put the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a journal in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month the &quot; extraordinary &quot; foundation &quot; based on the P@@ he founded its most important conclusion .
two other researchers are writing in BM@@ J and have asked whether to build the claims &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said the fact that the statement of P@@ it that &quot; the present best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes are approximately 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria analysis ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) in order to lead their opinions on the damage of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a Sponsor of the meeting named Euro@@ Swiss Health , which was managing director of British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes producer , but not the financing which he had received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , compl@@ ained of them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes Champions , some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco line of P@@ he took part .
the research work of the group &quot; is indic@@ ative &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , no such links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; it has so far been no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking allowed for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J has already responded to the statement of BM@@ J .
he said , &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second li@@ fel@@ ess smoking is dying on his suff@@ ice .
all evidence suggests that health risks have been minim@@ ized by e @-@ cigarettes in comparison with it , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the definite duty to the public on what evidence of evidence and what is not , especially if there is much public confusion about the relative danger due to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die every year on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking cost the national health system £ 2m a year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking causes , we fulfil our national competence .
BBC was going to leave East@@ En@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ caster .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they publicly saw public utilities which probably will probably be seen by a smaller audience , into hard @-@ cont@@ ested time window against the most popular shows of their rival and broadcasting from sc@@ ars like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said the company more in partnership with other organizations I said Johnson said he tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or transm@@ itting , which would also be clearly shown by not subsidi@@ zed rival , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee in the context of his investigation on BBC &apos;s future .
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I mean medium or long @-@ term content not for a good idea , one should do his production at least on programs that do not do or commissioned anything .
they send The Voice in a first class time window , because they want to achieve a wide support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous , it &apos;s natural .
Johnson said , &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive control program is financed , which could also be financed without the subsidies .
the voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly , both own product productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm .
I stri@@ ve to see how this should be public broad@@ ly TV .
I don &apos;t think that would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , a business@@ man for series , who led the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC will blame on reviews . &quot; because of the amb@@ ition of men who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give back what the former leaders of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ a gart lecture took place in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how to sell the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the more publicly @-@ legal N@@ ian programs should go to BB@@ C4 but they do not meet their duties , but they can argue along with their apparent in@@ missions to just@@ ification of £ 4 billion for broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs which no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window , in which no one ever wanted to see it ever .
for the broadcast fee Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather rainy system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here .
of course , think all of us think that one receives a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who &apos;s worth a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , I wonder if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should examine and enter@@ tain their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to form , to form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said , only little from the BBC production would now be classified as a education - he said that it should be 1 % of her TV production and 0.1 % in radio - and it should change to the public tel@@ ev@@ ised television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the one of the promot@@ ers , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of TV will be shown , and with the commercial transm@@ it@@ ments to make everything online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ at@@ etics &apos; can ste@@ er brain cell through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound imp@@ ul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by pal@@ ms of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment , in which they have high frequencies for the human hearing , which are to be heard , ir@@ radi@@ ated .
the imp@@ etus work through the inser@@ tion of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry out the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the lit@@ ters showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ at@@ etics , used with the ultr@@ asound , to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells inside the body .
Srebrenica &apos;s Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the trial of a day could replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , an invas@@ ive process that ab@@ uses electrical imp@@ ul@@ ses to the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
fil@@ th@@ m@@ mer normally does not react on ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic aerial bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asound waves , which penet@@ rate the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asound waves are based on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves are the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells , which they are assigned , such a journal Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ ions TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry .
when he turns ultr@@ asound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ blo@@ ws and transferred into the worms , where they place the changed mot@@ ions .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool which allows scientists to im@@ pose neur@@ ons with imp@@ ul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ at@@ ographer could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent down to an optical fibre to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic tissue can imp@@ etus and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus is possible , the asp@@ ed human neur@@ ons are temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added .

V@@ C@@ CP @-@ Creative Director Matt Le@@ ver was astonished at the silence that reigned around the advertising for the arms trade - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in residence halls
eleven years ago I drew as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old boy in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ at@@ ti@@ vism , but only now I remember the ten@@ sion@@ ing smile of them that I have sc@@ and@@ alized - and to the numerous , long @-@ breaking complaints about others .
most of the things I have learned can be dist@@ illed into eight simple rules .
the move in a student residence is enough to frigh@@ tening up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to che@@ ers : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have come to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you have &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither to hate nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just an yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
this gives a conversation and helps you to find the people who you like , in contrast to those you would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes would be burned down and this fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
people often turn into drinks @-@ recipes , film @-@ night venues and public meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and pick up their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ts receive a rough handling of the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble culture that is kind and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you go away to get the energy that I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a comp@@ ul@@ one of soci@@ alizing is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead .
apro@@ pos ank@@ lo@@ ps : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
since you start the university at the cli@@ max of the Back mania , the clo@@ ak is at the doors of people to imagine a bit strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked you a little bit . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain , and will perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are an decent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly missing cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat bring that people sleep more sleeping if you anchor .
steal food is a common crime in residence halls .
of course , the cla@@ ws of hen is theft , but is it taking a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea ?
check it with the milk owner .
chances are , they say to yourself , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , this is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to get more balanced than my fellow people who added to her milk a washing machine to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
it is now in jail .
they should make no noise , the people from sleep or off the job .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to man in the true sense of the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al who sit in the glass .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked its neighbors whether it turns them something to make Drum &amp; bass slightly qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
they responded to music even more listening to music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they left their neighbours sleeping two hours before they left their own music , shut up their door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would happen to happen by chance in the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be fundamental to embar@@ rass@@ ing if you have a toge@@ ther@@ ess for your future li@@ fel@@ ong partners to go and see them again and then you may have to see how they come across all common friends ?
of course , the heart is his own way - but if a hot co@@ ach@@ erin is definitely not your future wife partner country , try at least to speak a little reason to your abdom@@ en .
at the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his key in his non @-@ closed rooms , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing f@@ einer , than it seems .
a good stri@@ ve is funny , but it takes just moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson over security - but you never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
shut down your door , and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but stap@@ le their bel@@ ong@@ ings at the ceiling no more than twice .
ter@@ raced houses for refugees , all@@ ot@@ ers , straight operators
the real estate business Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on the central fr@@ enz@@ ical Eck@@ ental ter@@ raced houses for people who have not much money .
so important for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need dormitories , but as well as the su@@ cking mother and the poor cre@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; I show how you can still build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees are pushing onto the property market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on how fast adv@@ anta@@ geous residential space can be created : it builds inside a project ter@@ raced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing onto the property market .
what solutions do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for humans remain in a great part here .
in view of the refugee stream we also need enough living room in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ ked , three @-@ storey tire service is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a fe@@ at home needs the least place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates the integration .
that is different if one sub@@ divide the people in living blocks .
each of the six buildings , which are built straight in the pilot project , consists of three units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees say , it is peace , I go back .
then , houses can be re@@ arranged easily according to their respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
Guil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction process has lasted for six months .
this is reasonable .
have the provisions made complicated ?
Gil@@ dner : I realised my project correctly .
it is particularly complicated , always makes the imp@@ ending Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ hy special construction and the plac@@ ements .
us@@ eless .
it still exists , who creates three apartments in a ter@@ raced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no place in the cities .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the local residents react to their home house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury designs for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but do not waste the competitors for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , however : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but there were luxury apartments , which can hardly be able to afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ mo@@ wers alone .
I show how you can still build and build well today .
that is why it is .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; General &quot; type and then select &quot; software update . &quot;
if it is ready , you can download the phone option to download and then install .
some have been encountered after installation problems , since they get an error message inform@@ ing that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot;
to get the problem , users are recommended to maintain either until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may be able to make the delete of apps to make room - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by the sealing of updates . also , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating , or located close to a char@@ gers , allowing the battery to be charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not leave that the update will continue , as the phone may stop on half way and this could lead to a demol@@ ition of updates .

in addition to consultations , you can also participate in courses there .
the social foundation attracts from the mountain to downtown .
more precisely at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , you will receive questions of health and coun@@ selling information such as health care insurance , health care services or care insurance .
for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient care , that often care members will be left alone .
there are so many questions .
&quot; even though not many benefits of the insur@@ ers are not liable because the complexity of the insur@@ ances are hardly understood , &quot; explained the new master in Jut@@ ta W@@ eig@@ n , who is also responsible for the &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; business hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
besides the consultations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office also offers prevention , health , and wellness .
for this , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken with the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the Senior Center and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in the ideal manner .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and re@@ hab .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Le@@ ke Hei@@ ke Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ headquarters in downtown offers both business leaders particularly in demo@@ graphic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centr@@ alized infrastructure into the parts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
moreover , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) also dedic@@ ate the club office at age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and invite these offers to a regular so@@ lic@@ able presence . &quot;

&quot; when it was ready , I just called them . &quot;
the couple Mu@@ eller liked the idea of running the future in As@@ endorf .

about 2,000 patients come according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l each quarter in the practice of Fel@@ resi@@ ausen , in the Northern German language practices are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another veter@@ inary practice .
a positive side effect of practical implementation by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains at the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ eu@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor would have been found , she would have gone .
those who visit tr@@ ash lesson , by the way , is still looking forward in confi@@ dential faces : taking up the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the rocks .
with their farewell dinner in As@@ endorf , a period after all , the medical profession had been pract@@ ising over 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning , we only had two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ resi@@ ausen ch@@ uck@@ led .
after long time , a bit of sad@@ ness spread her after the long time .
&quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients often see , &quot; says the intern .
her husband is compl@@ emented : &quot; we have a 6000 square metre plot . &quot;
&quot; to date , I have always pressed free to gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now , the border controls are also driven on our southern border , &quot; said Minister @-@ Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
the controls on the Hungarian border are covered in parallel .
according to how it is clear that anyone who wants a asylum application would also be &quot; of course . &quot;
the supply and safety of the people stand in the fore@@ ground .
it is clear , however , that there might be clear signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people must know that we don &apos;t accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would leave refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and also establishing cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ nen Z@@ ni@@ dar was not seen in La@@ i@@ bach .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather be over@@ taking the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fying .
the border with Croatia may already be heavily controlled than the threshold limit of the Schengen area .
as the Minister of Ministers stressed , Slovenia wants to not abri@@ a its borders for refugees .
&quot; each EU member must fill his comm@@ it@@ ments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ ll@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government reported , the first refugees had attempted to pass in the night hours on Tuesday to pass in eastern Croatian by the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to follow the registration .
the Croatian police captured them in the near corn fields .
according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles are constantly meeting with new refugees .
there were mainly for Syrians and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with approximately 4000 refugees , Minister of the Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo , to the Maced@@ onian Serbian border that had previously carried out migrants to the Hungarian border , agreed to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade however , denied that it would be able to suggest certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor want to do this . &quot; he said .
according to the media reports , a first bus would arrived in the morning in the morning , with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town S@@ id , while more bus@@ ses would be expected .
through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria after Germany
the passengers travelled throughout the night of the Maced@@ onian border by Serbia about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have said the police to come here , &quot; said one of
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
it may actually be already predicted to mark the previous Balkan Route route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west @-@ distance route .
Croatia : comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatian Home Affairs Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic previously emphas@@ ized that his country for the case of a strong state of refugees had prepared appropriate plans for possible situations .
he did not refer to details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
you hold strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen Area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner has consistently been a good report about the country , which affects the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian site , some 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border of the Hungarian border .
according to the media reports , they reported last night at the crossing of Hor@@ g@@ os , who led to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , both the two border trans@@ itions Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to pass on to the Croatian border is still uncertain .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior Minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic tried to calm on Wed@@ nes@@ days at a local point in Hor@@ g@@ os : he keep the debates about Alternative refugees from refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , as early as the Hungarian border .
it would not be a very high number of refugees currently .
it could not be said whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
helper for migrants to - dangerous - Alternative items
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute the spread of refugees on which alternative routes by Croatia have been dra@@ fted by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of border area there are still 20 years after the end of the conflict there are still no more spacious min@@ ef@@ ields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers were sent to the border region .

with the exploited information , insi@@ ders @-@ shops should have been made on the financial markets .
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were rewarded .
&quot; the current comparison shows that even those who are finally caught outside of our country borders , &quot; says in the SEC notification .
the processes against 32 continued to be continued in the case .
most of the def@@ endants stem from Ukraine and Georgia .

again , on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for 20 @-@ year @-@ olds .
that not everyone wants to communicate on the tablets , however , be understand@@ able , finally , it was a very personal deal .
the subject of death and dying is to be punished with Tab@@ us , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , al@@ beit the Hosp@@ it@@ ising has helped a lot more in recent years to open the people .
an assessment that is divided by Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ y .
the death and funeral accompanying programme belongs to the honorary employees of the first hour .
through personal exploring on the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in death .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ian Hosp@@ it@@ aller sought the call of Hon@@ orary Agency , she immediately reported and was there in 1995 when it was founded .
Go@@ def@@ y belongs to a team of 45 honorary members - 43 women and two men - the affected and depend@@ ents in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ z Saint Vincent .
all are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ y can handle good with their task and to deal with the experiences gained and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another waiting , hold it for precious and ch@@ asing the moment , &quot; she says .
the offer of out@@ patient &apos;s out@@ patient community service is free and denom@@ in@@ ational .
financial support of health insur@@ ers and donations from relatives and clubs , training as well as trainings and super@@ divisions of the death and funeral directors .
all two years of training are offered for new employees .
the boards described above are present in the house of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1a ) and on the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
other personal wishes can be recorded for postcards , too .
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ ber Gig@@ ant lowered his win sight on a year owing to the weaker demand for freight carriers and higher costs in his boat transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for vacation .
at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
the share fell by more than 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. made a win between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than the previous forecast .
analysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the smaller view is higher , despite the price increases , which will reach an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4 and despite the higher sur@@ charges of heavy and major packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless , that the result was due to the previous year , due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and due to growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company will take solid earnings when expected to weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for a holiday @-@ employment were announced a day later as the rival UPS was announced that 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers have plans to set up the same number as last year .
in the third quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex deser@@ ved $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks investment research asked analysts predic@@ t .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of Z@@ acks predicted an expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex brought a decline in international priority for the last years to stag@@ n@@ ate sales in his unit Express Shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased its results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
in the last quarter sales were increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher cost packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit posted higher income due to higher prices , while the result of higher operating costs in the cargo sector decreased .
in the pre @-@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares decreased by 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
during the most anticipated meeting in the years , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ ag@@ ony @-@ table sitting in order to decide if it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade to make the Leit@@ z .
threatening about them at an end of fin@@ isher , two @-@ story seat @-@ sa@@ vi@@ als is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a memory that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues intend to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double @-@ digit order from the Congress : Maxim@@ ising the US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ written third term : financial stability .
and this third term of mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predic@@ t it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned by the imp@@ ul@@ ously short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make already more careful F@@ ed representatives to rein@@ force these volumes by raising the Zin@@ c for federal bonds - and it is also just one percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , the director of the Mak@@ ing @-@ man Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text that were not to increase the interest rate , increased in@@ security relating to the global market is enough just@@ ification , still to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed is doing , which self @-@ sec@@ ures themselves in the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists , who were questioned recently by Bloomberg , have predicted an interest rate that week .
the financial markets , however , expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists beat the impact by pointing out that a further increase is far away .
in Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average rose by 21.@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy holds the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at this time , &quot; he said .
if it does , &quot; she should go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets , so that it is not in panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an interest rate would calm down the financial markets , because it imp@@ airs the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed will take effect .
one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow con@@ vening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ella had said in the spring and early summer , that in the year despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the proposition may expect .
although the creation of employment slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that F@@ ed sees as full @-@ employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives reported that the main reason is the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices .
the economy can overcome higher interest rates and needs them due to tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ shaped .
but the financial markets all over the world gathered together at the end of the last month after China had appreciated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average value fell by more than 16 % in May by more than 16 % , when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would dro@@ wned the global growth .
this month the market has recovered something , with the Dow Automotive Market is now 10 % less than the end of May .
for the F@@ ed representative , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation , when one should increase the interest rates .
&quot; if events were not occurred on the financial markets and the messages about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US bank@@ note .
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certainty on what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the main activities of the F@@ ed , so they should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the former Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could reduce their monetary expansion &quot; tight &quot; causing confusion about the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , it can be expected from the F@@ ed representatives , that they will not only monitor the developments in other sites , but also consult with other central banks and experts to obtain better understanding of the global economy .
their decision @-@ making &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for Management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ re@@ actions on financial market movements , which seems to be linked with the economic fundament@@ als data . &quot;
L@@ ester , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , has been implic@@ ated for an interest rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its gui@@ deline by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite lim@@ iting effect on growth in the United States , &quot; said L@@ acker .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts down .
the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis as the market collapsed in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on behalf of the Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; I certainly don &apos;t want to fall into the situation in which they are afraid of an interest rate because the markets itself , &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act shall still contain the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that will be changed , I don &apos;t think it should come ahead of the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life relief for refugees
more refugees come to Germany this day in Germany .
to prepare a warm welcome , not without the commitment of a volunteer volunteer workers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a whole number of people who support the un@@ profitable asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is teacher and soul teacher .
she still teaches with her 74 L@@ ences .
every th@@ urs@@ days it works in the asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Strasse .

Brazil &apos;s p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian Organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy in the sho@@ cking way of women as important diet during the breast@@ feeding time . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted in breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk is made of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that provide all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers will catch their daily cal@@ orie intake to increase about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake would not supply the only dietary adjustment of the mothers .
a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the Municipal Council of Bern@@ ried appro@@ ves the building application for the 2.3 million euros of expensive sports hall .
and he did an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar system .
the plans for the long @-@ long gym facility at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports ground step forward by step forward : in the recent municipal meeting , the worked building application was blessed without a big discussions .
earlier , the panel among other things had an application for a &quot; respec@@ tful &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan .
with the &quot; exception , &quot; we went to permit a special form to the roof construction .
accordingly , a &quot; s@@ uns@@ hi@@ c roof with non @-@ adher@@ ent first and roof @-@ covered &quot; is meant to be built .
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; as a result , we get a wonderful large South shelter together , &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the &quot; Liberation , &quot; in turn , the gover@@ ning ten@@ dencies lead for energetic reasons - unlike the development plan , is to lie below ten degrees .
this will significantly reduce the volume of the hall .
the liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan on the roof of the roof . no exceptions , &quot; the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council normally provides more restri@@ ctive amendments to the submitted applications .
the turn@@ around is a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym equipment at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated to be around 2.3 million euros .
grants are expected from school and breaking sports .
in the next step of process the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now presented to the land@@ line .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg draws to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the New Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is seen by the surprising plans of the hospital , the Land@@ kre@@ ise , who confirmed the farm in Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
but a decision on board is to meet the Supervisory Board , and the t@@ end@@ ent on Wednesday , September 23 .
if plans were implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to continue at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should start with fishermen and the further existing interior into Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the employees who do not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au shall be offered to a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year , has now moved to a private practice near the hospital .
with the question he who is going to join , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into the game that was ready to take over the lead on 1 October .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is an &quot; recovery &quot; and distribution of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
fishermen is specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in the interior of gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years Fischer with his team , if the supervisory board is right to maintain both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , shall finally be closed after almost 140 years .
previously , the county had planned this year to 2018 , if the current re@@ building was completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim Clinic .
agriculture in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , came contrary to what the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White couldn &apos;t say , there are several consider@@ ations .
currently there are a short @-@ term care of the car@@ itas and a day sy@@ chiat@@ ry are accommod@@ ated there .
&quot; what better could happen to us , such an opportunity is not coming back , &quot; said Fis@@ her@@ man on the Qu@@ ot@@ asi , the Le@@ ch , who had been taken up by the employees &quot; positively and very understand@@ ably . &quot;
a real perspective for the house , where fishermen has been working for over 30 years , did not give it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take charge of the post of medical directors .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was always threatened with closure , divisions were closed , for example the surgery and birth aid .

refugees need accommodations : study warns of homes
the situation in the German residential market is ten@@ se .
also more refugees seek a affordable stay .
pressure on the property market is growing .
the social housing structure is facing a challenge .
the distributor in the German residential market have long been begun .
with the coming refugees and unemployed people from the EU , more people push for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , it would have to be built up to 400,000 new units by 2020 .
on the conclusion of this result , a study on behalf of the social housing project &quot; Social residential construction . &quot;
for comparison : this year , 260@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
thus , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are not obliged to live asylum seek@@ ers in the first three months of their stay .
many then put them on the property market and lined up in the apartments in front of the apartments .
however , according to the Federal Office of Stati@@ stical Office , less than half of the asylum seek@@ ers stayed in the last year .
however , the negative development of the residential market is not only the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant improvements in residential development policy of the last years .
Germany Schie@@ fer a residential deficit before itself , which becomes bigger one year ago .
at present , about 77@@ 0.000 living units were missing in the metro@@ politan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many experienced people lived in large cities in flat @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the property market &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per capita has decreased for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social residential construction &quot; strikes a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to stim@@ ulate the social housing structure .
the property tax could be ab@@ stain@@ ed , and the property tax for funded dwell@@ ings will be suspended .
also , according to the Alliance , according to the Alliance you need to am@@ use attractive dis@@ continu@@ ance possibilities .
the support program for refugees in the state bank Kf@@ W operates in cities and municipalities already well .
a good week after the start was posted on Monday evening with 184 million euros , more than half of the roughly 300 million euros made available .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia should serve a corridor .
considering Hungary it is not a passage , there are always more refugees crossing the road through Croatia .
Zagreb announces that departure from Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les to the north .
of course , the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate via the neighbouring country of Slovenia over the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Slovenian interior minister , and if it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Home minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already a Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is still a Schengen area .
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , there are hundreds of refugees to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people had come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV RTL broadcast .
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees in the morning .
new laws that came into force on the same day , are practically unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to leave refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; you can travel , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police have picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of the news reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with both the bus and Ta@@ xen to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they &apos;d have attempted to reach the green border to Croatia .
the refugees won &apos;t fall on border f@@ ences at the Croatian @-@ Serb border .
the border hang@@ s other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90s .
now , min@@ ef@@ ields will now create a safe passage .
according to Hungary , there are hardly any refugees after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday , the police closed 3@@ 66 offensive people .
shortly before tor@@ sion in Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian Law , the conqu@@ ering and damage of the boundary , are off@@ ended .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
prison sentences up to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were met on Tuesday in the newly arranged &quot; Tran@@ se@@ urs , &quot; of which nearly all - 93 - is the main transfer of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically , nobody has a view to granted asylum in Hungary .
according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
in front of the &quot; transc@@ ei@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , some hundred refugees were gathered .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke a worker started to disman@@ tle workers .
they gathered around the tr@@ ash to leave the tens of thousands of people over the road in the past few weeks .
the pl@@ ums were dismant@@ led , and one of the recording facilities in the border place was rebuilt .
no one was to express itself the goal of this renovation .
Austria access to the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country also strengthened its border controls .
however , about 20,000 migrants sailed the government still in the country .
around 1400 people wait for the journey to Germany in Salzburg .
the traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot .
Mayor drove &quot; rocks &quot; over the border
&quot; we were facing the bridge held on Sunday with the cleaning , when suddenly ten people were standing with travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ her Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany stopped , however , because of the refugee stream there was unexpected by train traffic to Austria , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the stran@@ gled together with two other helicop@@ ters and their cars on the border to the Na@@ he Pass@@ au .
prior to first we have once provided our un@@ trusted guests , with lunch and drinks .
we have said right , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was of course for us , &quot; so Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man left him not to transfer a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we are very happy , &quot; says the Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening in W@@ els of a ICE went up in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to start with the short notice , that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still try to try the boundary .
the regional train , however , was removed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein on Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge firm with the Bavarian neighbours is soci@@ able on Sunday , day before a two @-@ bridge sport@@ scar , organized by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
now , Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends another tick over to us is a logical outcome of a apparent Greek politics :
instead of helping to help establish structures in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke site , human@@ ity has officially launched the state of human@@ ity to support the stance of the Hungarian Government , the state of the Hungarian Government .
sorry for this policy are not only those Austrian who are now faced in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
moreover , they must realize that the &quot; praised country , &quot; which she invited and welcome , is nothing but another refugee camp .
there will be a major challenge , in view of the persistent refugee flow and the close win@@ em@@ akers , who make decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers .
and there will be another greater , peace , security , and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the quest for 35.000 winter@@ ly qu@@ arti@@ ly
Konrad has filled all hands with the refugee camp .
Christian Konrad is always acc@@ ust@@ omed to have his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to stop qu@@ arti@@ facts for thousands of refugees .
chaos in the first floor in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already seen a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported his first success .
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without a great vort@@ ex , Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; master performance . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , however , spoke of a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad with a need of 8@@ 5,000 things in the he@@ ur@@ igen year .
in order to meet the numbers , 35,000 accommodations must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will provide the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; said Konrad .
he has already led interviews with the capit@@ alists .
they would have added to him , even for the coming refugees quar@@ rel@@ ere .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it goes well , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations of the asylum seek@@ er also sets up the ORF action &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot;
individuals can offer individuals un@@ complicated accommodation on the platform .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier announced the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ner must have a certain height of the hand@@ le@@ holder or size of the gro@@ unding .
for a temporary period , the &quot; emergency standards &quot; should apply .
by contrast to the interior of the Ministry of the Interior , he reveals Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , who is not telling the im@@ perc@@ ep@@ tions without further .
persu@@ as@@ ive force is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier does not cause the Republic to cause no cost as they themselves stated .
their workforce , they want to increase it to three to four .
the own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ase was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better distribution
first no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the City of Linz .
this is currently not necessary because they are unable to under@@ take these measures without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) .
however , further locations are to be checked for emergency services .
critic@@ isms of the Town Council to the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts have to make their contribution here .
See@@ hofer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone session with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday the other occurr@@ ence in the refugee question is corro@@ ded .
See@@ hofer i@@ sures me that the German border are not mir@@ ro@@ red .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continue to continue .
however , there is the corresponding limit controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will not be giving it any more .
however , the protective seek@@ ers would however be brought to Germany by regular trains .
P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again required more hard solidarity in the refugee camp from the other EU member states .
that now Austria leads to inspec@@ tions again through Austria , is a logical result for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger &quot; a logical result . &quot;
the next Run@@ ta@@ stic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
in four of the six store@@ ys of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is tra@@ pped , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented in young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in start@@ up companies in the New Ship@@ yard and later that he can be acquired .
already from the beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - a few of which promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ ta@@ stic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ centre , which belongs to one third of the City of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is owned by Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
a total of 30 percent of the 2700 square meter space in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent there is en@@ quiries .

in fact , Jut@@ ta Bre@@ it wanted to get a dog .
this project had to close the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , she has got an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop compared to the business , which it sells among other things , bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes of various manufacturers , everything is turning all around Dam@@ en@@ han@@ di@@ caps of the Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets owned by 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
this has been rebuilt several weeks previously .
&quot; but I have been thinking about whether I should open a store , &quot; says Bre@@ it .
decisive for the decision was , among others , that even the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , who are at home in Bologna , were sold from the idea of a personal site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been placed by her mother in the cra@@ dle .

why such a woman with a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , also the specialist woman cannot answer with the last safety .
this is perhaps the fact that a beautiful bag is valued at any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the in@@ gen@@ itor of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called investors .
this property also bin@@ ds man@@ ders to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether it expresses foreign host@@ ile , journalists is concerned or to be revealed in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential campaign is po@@ uring heavily on the campaign .
and inter@@ sec@@ ts well .
this is also registered in the pe@@ at town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million origin@@ ate .
the New Yorker , with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur , is a concept to many in the wine @-@ village on the wine street .
maneu@@ ver in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to -@@ zig corners with it .
his grandfather came out of K@@ all@@ stadt in Palat@@ ine : Donald Tr@@ ump , while in election mode .
the town of K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers then think about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that is somehow exciting , but in their K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter way they are not so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spro@@ uts , with which Tr@@ ump also boasts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , so with the testimony that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
it didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the heart .
although , respect for the performance of the family , however , they ten@@ ds to think that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a bit of great la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name &apos;s nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt , in the circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the investors , says she .
from the village of An@@ de@@ an , Tr@@ ump comes out of the village .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the last grandfather emigrated to the US and in the USA opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers .
the foundation stone of the estate companies were first property in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : your wish to return to the country , failed to return at the Bavarian state , which the Palat@@ inate belonged back then .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once was without hom@@ olog@@ ation , had the director of the Institute for Con@@ clu@@ e History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , explains the film start .
tr@@ ump is the grand@@ child of an &quot; illegal out@@ flow . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ igation of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants from the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the pol@@ arity , it is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , an distant transformation of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born @-@ up Heinz &quot; ) .

Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson face to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the Today &apos;s ratings .
the Nine @-@ Show from Nine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ key created the Fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with facil@@ it@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this dis@@ advantage of the uprising seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , because Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at five major cities compared to Today 33@@ 9,000 .
today a slight increase in the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3.000 ) .

the great innovation for seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of series of the former Erik Thomson .
the new drama about a recent father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics asked how Thomson got a hit @-@ show Solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; .
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and beat slightly The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moderate by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe came to an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour of The Chase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 spectators and roughly 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Chase Australia will agree that hot @-@ Se@@ at finally will end at 17 : 30 .

the final three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery reveals ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have apparently got un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , who wins the Bachelor &apos;s .
the woman , at Sam Wood , at the Bachelor &apos;s degree , was placed in the largest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give thanks to whether she is the one that has received the last Rose .
but as we checked with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows a day before they checked out , you may acci@@ dentally see a hint on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood is holding his lips by the final on Thursday
all three women have left the ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and they called his mind for hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who would receive the last Rose ? , &quot; could their answers to be destroyed , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - besides himself - Mack@@ ay as best partner in Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a single relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought that it was pretty compatible throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on the ground , it makes so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; could be One &quot; that could be .
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m already subject to him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked who he should choose whom Wood is not , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the bach@@ elor &apos;s will be aired on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on the Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent qu@@ eries after his amazing training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some coach would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a little angel , just as it did the Aussie Rug@@ by @-@ League conver@@ tit at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and Hay@@ ne gave the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies ahead of the rest of the team , he encouraged her to grin@@ d her .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne on public in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ reporter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ hey , who advised him to forget his pat@@ ted catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is pat@@ ched by a pun@@ t which was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian tra@@ des@@ hip hopes for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble , and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could imagine no worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; it was a thing that happens now , one cares only for the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne told .
Hay@@ ne made the shar@@ pen@@ er with his original debut at that time in 2007 when a pass at its own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
nevertheless , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the free voters are demanding the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees .
party and leader Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger warned at the beginning of the FW @-@ autumn St@@ alli@@ on at the beginning of a serious crisis against Bay@@ erns schools , when there is no one of the many new disciples to preserve the school@@ ing at least 1000 additional teachers , in order to preserve the schools in front of the coll@@ age . &quot;

the public holiday attraction is t@@ opped up until Friday in the lower Commun@@ e community .
all other main topics were intended .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free elec@@ torate @-@ Meeting .
&quot; of course , the theme of asylum will be transferred to the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , just as it existed during the Yugoslavia during the 1990s .
&quot; that &apos;s not the way , we have to focus on the causes , &quot; said the free elec@@ torate @-@ chief .
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to shift the free voters as fast as possible .
therefore Ai@@ w@@ anger demanded more staff for the administrative , which are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
the FW boss critic@@ ised that several states are not consistent : &quot; we need nationwide standard standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria sho@@ ves right , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to be more powerful . &quot;
but the state policy in big wall@@ ets should not fall under the table .
a year @-@ long contin@@ ual day remains on the agenda : the image policy .
for the new school year , the cult minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot trial &quot; Central level plus &quot; with an extension of the gym@@ nasium in three to four years - in the result it will take nine years to a high school .

&quot; the topic of the G9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW chief .
we call for election freedom for all gymna@@ stics , which they want .

4 people killed after police officers shoot g@@ utter on protest@@ ers in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal when police fired g@@ mig@@ ra@@ de in a crowd that demonstrated the proposed new Constitution , an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Bis@@ hn@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that there were more than 1,000 protest@@ ers outside a police station , some of which threw stones and bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police have deployed tro@@ ug@@ as and then shot into the air , before they return to Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber masks used , of which it is known to kill , but traditionally used as less deadly alternative , obviously a high death rate produced .
the con@@ frontation was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nep@@ als southern levels where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces formed in the framework of the proposed new constitution would decrease their political influence .
there were also protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that want to have a private state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were killed in violent conflict since the 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement signed the country in Provin@@ ces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature said this week through certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .

Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling cash campaign to provide 11 million US $ for humanitarian organizations that would help thousands of refugees trying to flee the European nations since they are torn from war and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of donations in his blog .
rather than letting the announcement make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant who fled with her family from Kabul , wrote her personal experience for seven years .
&quot; for our trip there were many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and mig@@ rant crisis in Europe has grown , many people are looking desper@@ ately for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funding will amount to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / demo@@ graphic by $ 11 million to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

slightly exagger@@ ated diabe@@ tics can be helpful in weight loss surgery .
the benefits of loss @-@ loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if slightly overweight people with diabetes based on weight loss surgery is longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the death @-@ based data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery which wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weigh@@ ting loss operations and obesity surgery , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach .
you reduce hunger and lim@@ bs the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ surgical procedures have been treated as efficiently for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were conducted in people who are overweight , ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain extent of weight compared to size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are regarded as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compared two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach tu@@ bel@@ age - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes for people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI of those subjected to this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BMI in those who do non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disorder was completely dissolved and at 28 % in part .
in the medic@@ ally treated group the diabetes slow@@ ed fully only by one percent , and partially only about two percent .
in addition , the results were performed with the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyceri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors came out .
the researchers also supervised the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is held best below 7 percent , writing the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level dropped by around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; glyc@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , as the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also el@@ ves average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , significantly higher returns in BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete over@@ angle of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit from the surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of severe people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to obesity man who underwent a obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soo@@ thing for people with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we &apos;re waiting for a long time , until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , having fixed their bodies with obesity and diabetes , recur@@ ring is really difficult . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not record all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lie .
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to end violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the lasting refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , devoted to ethics and studies .
he demanded that , under the circumstances , the interests of humanity before the interests of the individual nations or even continents should be put .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
even though the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to overcome the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for which Muslim lands can be created , &quot; he stressed .
in the end , we must think about how the execution in their countries is decreased .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these issues , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented also George Bush &apos;s actions after the terror attacks of September 11 , and issued that the USA violent response was a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .

tox@@ icity centers in the US reports about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years which swal@@ low an alcoholic source of alcoholic , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants rose to children under 12 years of reporting the poison control centres , of 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go out in the not@@ ion , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said some children had to drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant while others do to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mutation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink only because of an inexpensive experience .
teenagers have reportedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol @-@ alcohol to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be stir@@ red by attractive sc@@ rolling of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ ked .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with strawberry , grapes and orange @-@ du@@ ps which are very pleasant for children .
disinf@@ disinf@@ ection products contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
some sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to the alcohol pois@@ oning especially with children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre in Kansas City Hospital in Kansas City , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant with reach of children , and when children come from it then it is a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently taken four ring@@ es of after strawberry @-@ disinf@@ ection products in school had been taken into an emergency treatment .
her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold if legally considered to be drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated them at the G@@ win@@ nice Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah re@@ acted her words and was unable to go as they arrived in the emergency department .
doctors over@@ saw them overnight in a separate children &apos;s illness at signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ian &apos;s mother , CNN .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ aries to store and disinf@@ ecting disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
alcoholic tox@@ ic@@ ation out , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants that ab@@ stain@@ ed a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities believe that the product me@@ thanol contained a fatal solution instead of eth@@ yl@@ al@@ kohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class were planned in the new York State , their &quot; mo@@ cked &quot; teachers by making anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against self @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants and banned them from their room .
the police looked at the vain plan as &quot; creature &quot; and presented discipl@@ ined actions to the school authority .

I don &apos;t think we feel at ease , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of cover competition in Scottish football bo@@ red low@@ lands - de Bo@@ er
the former rank @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there are no title ri@@ val@@ ry with Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they do not show highlights of Cel@@ tic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here not just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there &apos;s a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around the things , swear by D@@ eila .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eila has accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around .
after the defeat of Malmö and the following ex@@ crete from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 people from Aber@@ deen , which now lead to the top of the table now with five points .
D@@ eila said , &quot; Cel@@ tic had already bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry , or sad about what happens .
we feel exactly this - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic , because that makes the players better .
now to get together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton c@@ auti@@ ous in January transfers
despite his comments just a couple of weeks ago that he ha@@ sted out that he ha@@ sted some January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is c@@ auti@@ ously careful with the signing of new access and insi@@ sts that he doesn &apos;t want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ ders .
the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
the players who come in the summer will have this pre@@ season time to integrate what you &apos;ve seen with our own group in this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is served by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

Mc@@ Mal@@ es said : &quot; there is no team who has won everything in poker games or le@@ agues , which didn &apos;t have won the games of this kind . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while rising in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July , unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom had increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
the unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 per cent on the U@@ UK@@ s of NSC 631570 , as the figures for the National Statistics Office ( for dating only ) showed .
meanwhile , the occupation in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent in the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
commenting on the latest figures , the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan for the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase of employment and a decrease of unemployment .

why I am a witness to an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope it is not happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator in the death @-@ chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was first mentioned in January of his best friend , and although I sho@@ cked , I agree .
when the day approached , I began to be afraid .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists don &apos;t want to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications than places available to decide who decides to choose who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who will be selected will observe it em@@ power@@ less .
I cannot do that .
I &apos;m going to sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook &amp; pen drawing up to record what I see .
I just have to try to remind me of all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ part@@ isan on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
she spati@@ ally thought &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks he will help the public@@ ity work of the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Podcasts that I have made .
here I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say security that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ esis ass@@ ailed him to be a favorable practice .
but I believe that there is a strong li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe it is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from that perspective I &apos;ll see him die .
I can not claim to be really objec@@ tively .
there will be other rep@@ orters , where you can contact them .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man of unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police , ch@@ ase ch@@ ase ch@@ ase , coming from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man of Perth that crashed on the police , was un@@ successful when he was in sil@@ ken and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few metres from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the Police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was created on Tuesday at a peace of peace in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when she discovered the susp@@ ects , he attempted to escape in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I come not out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c wasn &apos;t too excited to make his uniform , so he turned out a reliable tac@@ tic . &quot; a good polic@@ eman is negotiated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Master @-@ soccer player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 Cou@@ sins started his car in the dit@@ ch to escape from stopping drinking alcohol and then tried to swim over the Swan River .
his efforts have been un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ sins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards attempted to sp@@ atter him and threat@@ ens to finish the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria decided to install a spy on his st@@ ables every year and threatened to finish the race at once .
he targeted at the ste@@ wards and the integration department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they launched a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last Stro@@ h@@ half on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said to Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best suited to race sport and he himself found himself among difficult conditions as it went around the positive cob@@ alt @-@ feeling of Li@@ dar@@ i that he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months due to the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age alleg@@ ations , and did not want it to look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long been sitting on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .
they know it was far@@ ther .
sometimes you re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it , what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head , and I want my owners think that I &apos;m trying to do my best .
if you start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had uploaded the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integration Division tried to pi@@ onate his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I &apos;m going to be asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com .
apparently , you obviously believe that I am a che@@ er .
if that is the case , they certainly should hold on their n@@ oses because they are trying to hold me out .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , re@@ ig@@ ning President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ un@@ dry , have been aware of the current CEO .
should it be convinced that this will be personal ?
does the RV@@ L stand firmly and make people responsible outside of the train@@ ers in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the sector ?
maybe people think out there , that I am there .
maybe they have to give me my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is thinking about it right now .
but now I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and pushing it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ stration level of the train@@ ers have assembled themselves with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt @-@ analysis at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to that he said &quot; could throw himself his license above the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ prepared mo@@ ors Black ca@@ viar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse , which viol@@ ates the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
I have to take up the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my co @-@ workers had pat@@ ched mud on the leg .
it would have been so last night .
it could have been so yesterday throughout the day , so what was like that .
but it also had so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation on this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need the rules , but here it is too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy competing against rival for claims to ring Ring@@ ing
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ized the &quot; Agenda S@@ etting &quot; on the &quot; Agenda S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites in the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators will have allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring competition &quot; with his team during the high Storm Vic@@ tory in Sydney in Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a little hidden note to the Storm team , after his team had reached the final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland don &apos;t have &quot; too good &quot; in the R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ends the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that they are only concentr@@ ating on their &quot; contact &quot; only on their &quot; contact &quot; .
Bell@@ amy was added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team agree with it , as it means that they are worried they were defeated by the Storm team .
&quot; that is always up @-@ up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ fights when they left us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that in the whole year we have changed anything at our def@@ ensive system or techniques . but in the past six weeks , we made our contact with tac@@ kles for a real focus and that made the trend turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to lose it so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny as it appears again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has got an idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and remember his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ler St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne talks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ized as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a bill of divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and watch it as exciting , in particular its young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of gam@@ bl@@ ers .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they &apos;re a bit worried , to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it went to Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos probably was a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses doing and are not a point of cl@@ amping ?
for me it is the game plans .
when we mention ourselves , it means that we will meet in a phase still on it .
the Storm team will be free at this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will comm@@ ence from next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 deposit according to drug @-@ cl@@ an@@ age
a man , who may potentially have a life @-@ long punishment because of its attempt to get to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which had been for@@ ged into Queensland , was released on a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came to South America on V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the Marina in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life penalty for the attempt to possess a commercial deal of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argu@@ ed that it was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the mag@@ nific@@ ence of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in case of pen@@ al , he lied to the police about his place of residence .
bro@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release .
&quot; according to reading the ins@@ ati@@ ful explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Judge St@@ agan .
but this alone will not be sufficient to stop it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on security deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ ides his Australian and his Serbian Pass at the time of the police , and with@@ holds itself to a lock @-@ block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ oph@@ ile to the end of pictures
a female dog used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand images from child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g taking the phone when this was asleep , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ defined images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the sleeping H@@ og@@ g &apos;s hand .
she saw it , the conf@@ using news and al@@ ar@@ ming immediately her mother immediately .
the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analyzed then computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; Web research , concepts for searching for in@@ consistent pictures of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed that he would have done so , since it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile in the Internet , &quot; and then he &quot; was there to be a polic@@ eman , to sc@@ are them . &quot;
the state lawyer E@@ ili@@ dh Robertson told the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a su@@ p that he is addic@@ ted to people .
he answered that the search were carried out on the computer from him , but said it was to happen because he wanted to ass@@ ert a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ma@@ ids .
he asked his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
he said he was sick of his head when he drinks , and said he would see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson , added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was fasting and weeping .
she then saw the in@@ contin@@ ual pictures on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused was using computer and Playst@@ ation to speak to girls who saw a lot younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pleaded guilty on the meaning of the indictment , to have in@@ disp@@ ro@@ wed images of children on the 14th of June of this year against the charges and did not appear before the court hearing held on 24 March this year .
def@@ endant Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g appears not in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; can be found in his tre@@ ason .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael went missing the verdict up to October , to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted security deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for some people in custody .
he was still taken before the date of judgment to the directory of sexual crimes .
Schle@@ user devi@@ ates to small border crossing to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up by the major control point in the German @-@ Austrian border .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are human @-@ un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee to the Te@@ gel clinic , which was placed for months in a small cell .
due to injury of their human rights , prisoners were eligible for financial compensation , when they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision adopted the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
those affected can even then hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex in@@ mate of his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe ; he was housed in a single cell with approximately five square meters floor space between June and November 2009 , and the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who was transferred to the outside of his estate , was transferred to a bigger cell .
his ministry is due to un@@ question@@ able detention conditions against the State of Berlin .
however , the Constitutional Court uph@@ eld the judgment of the chamber &apos;s chamber and refused to return the case .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
although for legal reasons there were only a few days of detention to the repar@@ ation for the compensation , a compens@@ atory was given .
otherwise , &quot; an infr@@ in@@ gement of the legal protection of the personality is to be afraid . &quot;
the chamber decision must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the constitutional judges have already strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus they only said in April of in@@ mate damage , because he was sitting naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision from 2011 to also the multi @-@ assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe , moreover , confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , a prisoner of in@@ exhau@@ sting accommodation in November 2009 .
the then war ra@@ cket lasted three months from 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come in the head@@ lines for the last few weeks .
prisoners are therefore continually included in 23 classes , aggressi@@ veness , even to temples , it is said to have already passed because of the ang@@ ered location .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of young@@ sters , 19 are to fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are making the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are expected to come to Germany by the Federal Ministry of Germany this year , according to the testimony of Vice President Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrates the unusual challenge of determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we create it . &quot;
what comes to Germany , con@@ veys the following overview .
it is necessary to apply to various forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( by the Pest@@ el Institute ) apartments every year - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living room is rather dramatic , but above all at paid out@@ fit objects : annually 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social flats come from the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments will also apply refugees .
for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
a lot to little is that from the perspective of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing each year would have to arise and that the Federation would have to grant € 6.4 billion a year .
in spite of this , scientists and the Federal Minister of State is that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates of the institute for labour market and working research , 55 percent of those in Germany can be employed in employment .
however , refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically in their qualification in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but it is crucial for the integration of refugees , but they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation to the admission fee , but also for self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the thr@@ um , there was a political turn@@ around in Germany : the labour ban for refugees at the recognition of work .
while there was an employment ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ers of asylum seek@@ ers .
in society itself - even because of the lack of lack , the visibility is thought that refugees ought to be made faster than access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German language .
so far , there is no exclusive offer of general and business @-@ related language courses .
research shows also that work@@ places are most often communic@@ ated by personal contacts .
the structure of networks is , therefore , according to the view from Thr@@ än@@ hardt to the king road .
the Berlin School of Education has found that only a few steps had to give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the root @-@ root parents , it is only once very important to hold the family , &quot; says Il@@ ya Kos@@ chem@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family from the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in different languages .
if the need of educ@@ ators were rising sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate aims to increase the training capacity by increasing the training colle@@ ges .
in the countries school students are prepared without language categories in welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by full @-@ educated teachers , but as in Berlin , also of teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of short@@ age , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations from the Berlin school administration .
the German student body estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Federal State asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ali@@ zed the study - the only exception as far as Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its stance .
study expenses could be facil@@ itated by access to the university .
for refugees with a resi@@ ding or for@@ tification does not receive any benefits after asylum seek@@ ers , if they begin studying .
the latter is basically not a B@@ af@@ ö@@ t , since they are not falling under the circle of b@@ af@@ ög@@ s .
Ged@@ ulated refugees had to have lived four years in Germany in order to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ G @-@ entitled , from January 1 , 2016 , this sp@@ ue has fallen to 15 months .
but these finance plans must be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German student works .
the students should immediately get b@@ ang@@ aro@@ l immediately .
Islam will in future play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually revi@@ ve the same rights as they have the churches , and continues to develop the existing state @-@ churches right to a new state religion .
it is also important that the creation of a Islamic welfare state , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers to the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights belongs to the rights .
so the representatives of Islam must be united to clear contact partners and willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and to build some control options .
it also belongs to the read@@ iness to act on religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed his concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
those who wanted to escape such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will in future be a lot more than a topic of society today .
thereby , the majority of ownership will have to change as a result of degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany indeed - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination scenario over a decade and a General Gender Equality Act .
but it is very slow to learn how the NSU @-@ folders showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and advoc@@ acy groups have been committed to Germany for a long time and for why international agreement such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany , must remain reality in the coming years , if the country will remain peace@@ fully and its new citizens should use their ways - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is unable to maintain the expected refugees medic@@ ally , by the name of the President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we create this , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel impres@@ sively .
however , additional money has to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery demands for the same time with the registration of health cards .
subsequently , services could be reck@@ oned with the federal states later .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to see so many people with the limited performance catalog to see the asylum seek@@ ers of asylum .
otherwise the doctors do mainly make voice bar@@ riers .
as early as before , the Berlin @-@ based health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de proved that migrants are clari@@ fied in relation to their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical surg@@ eries would have accepted the interpre@@ ting costs , it calls for them .
also , many refugees had been helped with more general medical start @-@ ambul@@ ances in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic ga@@ ze .
among the refugees , there are much more un@@ treated disability , and with the young people it is about HIV clari@@ fication .
however , with the partial other disease pictures , German doctors from their education , however , says Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite in@@ fest@@ ation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize , &quot; and in which the medical care is concerned , the refugees may be bl@@ ur@@ able even in sight by refugees .
the Syrians would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees and even doctors .
in order to practice , however , they would have to recre@@ ate their qualification and bl@@ ur@@ red again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is superf@@ lu@@ ous according to the Federal Patent Code ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) : most of them suffer from trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially viol@@ ate the refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains the president of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study published in Munich is evidence that every fifth Syrian refugees had traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone who has been diagnosed on a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress error is suffering from the so @-@ called Flash@@ back with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart attacks and fat@@ alities .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentration problems , strong sc@@ ru@@ th@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , early treatment may be necessary , Mun@@ z stated .
so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ically ill refugees get a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide an application for psycho@@ therapy , but the processing usually lasts several months .
in addition , non @-@ skilled workers or doctors , who are not trained in psychological illness , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ under@@ estimated , says Mun@@ z .
man@@ ege invites to dream
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst attacks on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to attract any age group in the sp@@ ell of intri@@ gu@@ ing acro@@ b@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and embar@@ rass@@ ing entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst joins the cre@@ ege on the bricks by was@@ ps to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and juni@@ ors .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the actual time stage production .
for more than 33 years , the Cir@@ cus is in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst .
the gift to am@@ a@@ ze the family is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to take part in a completely different world for two hours . &quot;
the administration of the world @-@ flat fla@@ ir , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst .
this fla@@ ir can now experience 50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour .
the Cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces by talented artists from around the world .
in the International Cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family pul@@ ls the audience with a joke and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .

60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every aspect .
the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ izes the mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the post@@ ure of circulation are only very often subject to different animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst is also taking place : &quot; it is not good for our animals , don &apos;t let us go well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents are enjoying every string unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately mentioned , will be read from the eyes after every wish .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal doesn &apos;t feel good , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the head@@ count .
the top commandment is : good for the animals .
specifically on her Zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra@@ des , the Pro@@ bst family is proud of .
the two animals spent eight years in a struggle and nothing happens .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst says .
the zeb@@ ox is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mascot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
so for each visitor is likely to be something there .
&quot; one thing is safe , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with my whole heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst will take place from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 : 00 pm .

Zimbabwe : Robert Mug@@ abe holds a false speech in parliament
Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he was im@@ pover@@ ished , but the case of the case spread rapidly over the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by the claims of dep@@ uties of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mug@@ abe with Bu@@ ehr@@ inger .
last month , they had hidden it and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opponents have received SMS messages upon their cell phones which they warned against Mr. Mug@@ dis@@ es .
&quot; the message comes from one number , which is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said to journalists at Mug@@ dis@@ es . &quot;
they warns against the members concerned that the immun@@ ity ends in parliament , and as soon as they leave parliament , the parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .
the leader , who led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , was concerned &quot; concerned about the dangers for politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
in this year , HP will split into two publicly tra@@ ded companies and split the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected amount reduction leads to a load of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP announced in one statement .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive which should guide the unity after separation .
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is smaller and more focused on HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ness portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual and &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ reach , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; says an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , in order to produce electrical installations and the Palo Alto garage is &quot; the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive re@@ structure to handle the conversion of traditional PCs towards mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers , and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area which is based on the conviction that closely focused companies achieve a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas .
this optimi@@ stic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss out at least the next four matches for England , and in view of its history , his stake in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace at this recent problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and then returned to his old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that was not well healed .
that is no major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his kn@@ uck@@ les or with the injuries , which he had previously .
this may be true from purely medical perspective , but such as Wen@@ ger even recognized , there is the corresponding danger of further injuries , whenever one player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 from Arsen@@ as 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five play times .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight players since 2007 / 08 , which have been one of the most vulnerable days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but arsen@@ al believe that an improvement in the risk of po@@ aching during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come from an injury , you have a more acci@@ dental period of time in which you have to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome them .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the species , which he deserves .
Arsenal begins his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on coming Wednesday and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team .
h@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveling to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start in part .
Wen@@ ger can begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ c@@ ott .
&quot; I try to keep balance and players who need it to indul@@ ge a small break @-@ break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are passed through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the slots with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten in 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
on Tuesday evening , the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake , in which the Richter scale was 3,2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has moved the apprentices@@ hip out of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and ab@@ orted from the distant hope , to lead its club to its first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is imm@@ ed , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked for arsen@@ al .
we stayed in 2006 very close to it , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in the shop to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship celebration : the Com@@ edy show that gives us a serious lessons about male friends
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , particularly in regard to how the need for men to open , now more doub@@ ted than ever has become , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ court prove .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ de ( CA@@ LM ) has announced the year &apos;s campaign against a erb@@ ated life ) 2015 than the year of the man to question the culture in question if they are seeking help when they need this .
friendship is the heart of the battle to master this challenge .
a current study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressed symp@@ tom thought that if the suffering has enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances are doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circuit of mentally healthy friends cut the risks of mental problems .
but of course you must first have friends so that friendship can work .
in the age of social media , communication with its focus on style , the in@@ ability of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , viable and successful , doubles , even if the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists express ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , everything on costs in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on its head .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ined by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents at football matches in cozy singing and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can definitely get back in any case , even if they often return to explore fully their feelings .
as a employee of the telephone calls it explained to me : ... &quot; my listen@@ er on people who are de@@ pressed and vulnerable to me , really demonstrated to me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
the old phr@@ ase , &quot; I come to righ@@ tly , &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , when you talk about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes in mind , when I try to offer long @-@ term comprehen@@ sion systems .
it presents quite clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much of my objective out@@ si@@ der status via phone the people in sight of desp@@ air can also help , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend of Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ festiv@@ ity with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you &apos;re sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile and say hello .

di Mary meets , to help PS@@ G help to destroy Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh Cav@@ ani after his hits vs Malmö .
in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and will help PS@@ G to pass by Malmö .
here are the game Report and the response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cav@@ ani considered Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö at the stadium stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met in less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before it finally increased its lead when Cav@@ ani recorded a head@@ board at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ oc@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A we needed a strong start to the Swedish champion , since they don &apos;t just want the qualification for the K.@@ C. laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class@@ mate of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ s &apos;s team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics missed opportunities in front of the gate . he became later in the game against his home town team and against the club , with which he began his lively career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to look back to our opponents because there are certain things we have to do in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; that is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we have won , although I am sorry that we haven &apos;t reached another two goals . &quot;
according to his injury in one of three modifications to the Paris @-@ team , Mus@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris @-@ Team on the weekend , but he was able to hold his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was pier@@ ced by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian gul@@ ing@@ man became known as the man who took over the PS@@ G on the next stage in Europe , and he made it clear why when he entered into Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is pass behind the Malmö Defense , before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of our multilingual network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off , to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine National players on the field and was excited with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle class .
but out of a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who passed away from Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ posts at the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ alignment and bad cre@@ tions , not least from Sw@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not only in less than five attempts , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had installed him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill if he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass of Jo@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria in a turning turning turning away from Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute by the P@@ ect .
the second gate finally fell short after the Hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus scored the six season of the season , after Hi@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had spotted a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
that finished all thought that Malmö could come back into the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to stop the end result before the spare player E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized in the end .
the trainer of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later announced that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwe@@ gi@@ ans said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have played only in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level .
the qualifying games do not submit . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca betra@@ ys X@@ avi , he said already before the F@@ EM 2008 before leaving from Barcelona .

Matt Dam@@ on doesn &apos;t play diversity in the film
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ american film@@ makers Eff@@ ie Brown on a discussion about the diversity and said she &apos;s not needed behind the scenes .
while a result of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light dis@@ rup@@ ted the experienced actor Brown , as this emphas@@ ised the need of alternative perspectives , referring to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do you do it with the instr@@ umentation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; wrote Dam@@ on .
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , ins@@ ulated un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actors of The Mar@@ tian settled .
Dam@@ on and Brown closed the producer of producing Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ thing brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to think people who think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and it is a sp@@ line that is defeated by its white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People put up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to film ; Dam@@ on answered that their direction &apos; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion has been broad@@ cast@@ ed , the Social Media explo@@ ded dis@@ appro@@ ve about Dam@@ on &apos;s Comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni pushed his rage over the clip , saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can tell their diversity - this is SO KNOW that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the site served more than 5,000 retin@@ ets and 4,000 liqu@@ eurs since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a time when the precise r@@ att@@ ing representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
after the teenage father of Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Movement of Black lives had a nationwide effect and urged the legisl@@ ature and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against dy@@ es .
in February , the singer Prince pays homage to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums are silent , &quot; ( albums are still their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums are still very important .
more recently , leaders of the Black lives Mat@@ ter movement have published a statement on the question of the Fox News character Elizabeth H@@ assel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate @-@ group .
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le that are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he received an invitation or already received the Pope , is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport climbing and operating help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition @-@ show , which completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obst@@ acle course .
during the season there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the finals .
the last task assigned the climbing at a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time , with which he finished the first Ath@@ lete , which completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of the American Ninja Warrior . however Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds qu@@ icker than the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! News after the hard fighting victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 , or for life , &quot; Isaac said E ! about his hor@@ des money .
so suddenly .. I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished first at all , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money is going to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it will be one of the fastest time , &quot; says We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , it receives the great horror .
I don &apos;t think he was swe@@ aring up about it .
he is just so happy having done what he has done .
he received awards of awards earned by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off told me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt so felt when they had sw@@ apped the roles .
America Ninja Warrior is pro@@ longed for a season , which will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers grinding at Minnesota T@@ wins past
MIN@@ N@@ EA@@ N The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once again they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly with Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field .
the T@@ wins brought an opportunity to climb within a half of the Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League Wild@@ card game .
for Detroit , though only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so hard to hold on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all the victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad 8 .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept supporting his early offensive support for Detroit three times in the first two routes , then once in the sixth and then once in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested for 6 times in the 1 / 3 interior and performed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go inside into the game .
the newly designated tiger @-@ ho@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since then he had four hits against the Seattle navy on July 6 .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the bal@@ lot of wood , &quot; said Aus@@ m .
he looked good at ( impact training ) , looked clearly better from the bull@@ pen , and he brought it right into the game .
with three rings at the back of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double in the left hand line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colourful , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man with whom he was confron@@ ted , in front of the design@@ ate ro@@ ok@@ ie @-@ kn@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , which was entr@@ en@@ ched by a two @-@ Run .
with a couple of buyers and the end @-@ Run in the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen made the third B@@ eman Tre@@ vor of Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double play .
it was that in the major league &apos;s leading 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe got a double play .
after Detroit added a fan @-@ run at the end of the ninth down , the Wall managed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of Bruce Ron@@ don and scored a 5 @-@ 4 stand .
the right @-@ handed train , however , turned to three pit@@ ches for the fifth grade .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the start of the game by an unprecedented Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers received three R@@ uns in the first two routes against the right @-@ handed @-@ veter@@ an who had been kn@@ itted before the game of the injury of the po@@ orer , after he had been missing more than one month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;ve wished me , &quot; Hug@@ hes , &quot; but I felt worse than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches since the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off batt@@ ali@@ on , there was one single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game that hit a single &quot; up the middle &apos; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the runner in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third b@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , as he tried to get the threat .
the Tig@@ ers came in the second to receive a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to a 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he was not well beaten , but he caught the right spot .
Hug@@ hes was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the relie@@ ver right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ viewer .
Hug@@ hes came to three hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs at Hug@@ hes .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal Sanchez was divided because of a violation of the litter concentration .
it is investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder from Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , since the middle of August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder line , is to be activated for the launch on Wednesday .
with Sanchez C@@ d out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted by the vulner@@ ability list to start T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 in four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since then he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has found on 20 August due to a force in the right wr@@ ist in the right thigh .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is playing in Minnesota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )

his arrival was expected for the night at Wednesday .
people are then to be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , like the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday night .
it reck@@ oned up to 450 to 750 years of coming refugees .
several sp@@ ades of the Hisp@@ anic state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees may temporarily wait there .
they will then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in Hessen , according to the issu@@ ing officer responsible for the first @-@ up government .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up a great number of refugees in sports halls because of the great number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria a option
the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; I believe that the thou@@ ght@@ ful thinking about military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said .
he cast away the European states &quot; collective consciousness . &quot;
four years ago , we were happy that the cup of military involvement in Germany has passed .
&quot; now the conflict broke out in front of our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive rise of international assistance to refugees .
Austria controlled in southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again adopted inspec@@ tions on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister for Internal Affairs , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station , and no one sent back now to Hungary .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; she declared .
on the question of an agreement to which Germany could take a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , it had already been giving discussions between the General Director General of Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
concrete figures did not refer it and rejected talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the last days , tens of thousands of refugees came from Hungary to Austria in tens of thousands of refugees .
your goal is usually Germany .
ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit with several other EU leaders for next week .
Germany finished on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have not committed to a common approach in the crisis so far .
the EU interior ministers want to take a new attempt to take over another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee cluster in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in their first and distribution of human beings .
the association will manage this together with the countries , announced the funeral for almost four @-@ time meetings with the Prime Minister in Berlin on the late Tuesday evening .
Merkel under@@ cut those people , the protection , they receive these .
but who does not have a lead @-@ eye view , could not remain in Germany .
this view was op@@ pres@@ sive in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor has stressed the state as a whole , now has to overcome a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
in the meantime , thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed his 175 km long border with Serbia in the night .
a few hours ago , the government announced that the border reached Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring land is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary needs to prevent the execution of the excav@@ ation of Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said to the planned new border .
the Romanian government condemned the Plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of men who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of migrants lost their way to the Greek border .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but who wants to pay attention on its stream@@ lined line , it is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged .

they should be kept at room temperature and be consumed within less days .
then they drink naturally pure or in tasty dishes .
but there is also sa@@ vory food with a special note .
it mel@@ ts the lightly bitter taste of man@@ holes like ch@@ ore@@ se and ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Mang@@ och@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and game .

with the place in symbo@@ lic@@ ally , it is evident that the tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered a young August@@ ine fri@@ ght around the year 1510 / 11 some months in Rome .
he emp@@ tied the city as a fallen sin @-@ ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions let him em@@ powered him in his later battle against Rome in his later battle .
Luther was then initiated by his thes@@ es against the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the Western Church .
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the major works painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and explained Bible tex@@ ings .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar alto , who form@@ ulated his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and screen in 150 moti@@ ves .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 year old - but by no means in@@ significant is with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite dark .
for about three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he had made a sub@@ jective @-@ artistic selection from the many theme of the &quot; Book of all books . &quot;
created are cycles that dev@@ ote topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or father@@ hood .
he spont@@ aneously said several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler Publishing House with his focus on art books .
and this is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who portra@@ yed on the basis of painting with the particular Bible places .
he has interpreted the Bible verses from Ot@@ mar Alt and thus into today , translated into current connections . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
it is embedded in the original Bible study of Martin Luther and a proposition of the artist who form@@ ulates his personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden spoon .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to give twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Old , born in 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; once the up@@ bringing happened to the tube , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern was to save the art in faster time again : &quot; the perception of imag@@ inations is influenced by an advertisement , and that is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed .
artists have a different desire and del@@ ights to show things .
pictures are always curious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to view the viewer in the pictures , &quot; letting them appear , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost conf@@ essed the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , which has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like what he understands with his images . &quot;
old did not care to compreh@@ end the Bible completely , but chosen for him important , also mysterious subjects .
&quot; it was not a collaboration on the eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images that explains the text . &quot; a picture of a picture was created .
for Hans Mö@@ hler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for se@@ venti@@ onal both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and sheets - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition presenting the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X track
plans were made , place found , company responsible for a circuit board . a year later , almost everything was done - yet before the official opening of the BM@@ X track had already been completed .

DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees to 2019 , and the Bundesliga takes a distinct sign on the weekend .
football react to Germany and sec@@ ures his help in Germany and sec@@ ures his help in managing the upcoming problems .
&quot; I hold this for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , it doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; it needs to be interested in each individual , this theme in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday at the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery and meet the minister of State for Mrs Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ lu and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; he will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced .
football could help and wool will help .
the decisive move must , however , must establish politics .
this is why the German soccer league has therefore expanded his youth initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung we ensured that this program continues to continue until 2019 , &quot; Mr Wol@@ s@@ bach stated on the edge of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some Federal officials support this program .
as early as this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ized a clear sign , if they are on the left tri@@ cot instead of the otherwise custom@@ ary Spon@@ sor@@ rows ( Hermes ) to help &quot; We assist - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sports leader Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler told the &quot; Picture &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; Self @-@ intel@@ li@@ vity . &quot;
&quot; the refugee movement of refugee goes every time , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we can use soccer players , no , we have to use our ir@@ radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that were so incredibly suffered , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ he@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the national team .
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large common association with German football . &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had launched their own projects in their places was great .
it is as great that small and smallest associations are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent is living in football .
&quot; that is of tremendous significance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government represents 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole world for 2015 , &quot; K@@ id@@ s@@ bach reported .
reports : SAP Managing Director loses an eye on accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reportedly lost several reports that the left eye was lost in the beginning of July .
after the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water glass , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost ble@@ eds , he was power@@ less , then to@@ wed to the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could work with his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet at the over@@ sight session in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was involved in the meeting and &quot; full unemployed . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software group .
&quot; I am full of SAP , &quot; full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I stood at regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t generally comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer it was no longer in German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to have such a personal history to the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen that something . &quot;
&quot; it is important to get up again , if you &apos;ve fallen . &quot;

football : Bv@@ Q without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes of Marco Re@@ us opened their com@@ eback in the first group of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the football field in the Du@@ el with the F@@ k Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we can &apos;t go back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
if Re@@ us will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B Coach is open again : &quot; we expect return from it to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ ry only on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change to the door@@ ke@@ epers .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking place in place of headquarters in Nov@@ ki .
&quot; he trained in an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the world champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is being used in all Europe @-@ League games in all Europe @-@ League games , however , Tu@@ ch@@ el left out .
he is also going to match the second match with high probability .
the for@@ ging statement by players Re@@ us that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League had to be the goal , holds the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for re@@ tra@@ ce@@ able : &quot; that Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
robot cars : government wants role @-@ iter@@ ations for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be the conduct of the vehicle &apos;s technological progress .
in Wednesday , the Federal kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which , among other things , will see investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday at the edge of the Auto Show in Frankfurt from a &quot; new mobile era . &quot;
automated driving and net@@ worked driving will increase the road safety and provide less steel , &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt said .
he also plans to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G7 countries , which also come together with representatives of the industry .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport is emphas@@ ized among other things the significance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and a generous donation on digital radio channels .
for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on highway 9 in Bavaria .
to ensure the driver &quot; no additional liability issues are br@@ ushed , &quot; the German government plans to examine the legal framework conditions &quot; and , where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
for instance , Germany would like to use some international reasons , that the permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also plans to use a change in the Vienna Convention , which only sees people as a driver so far .
in increasing driving , the car will take over the management , the driver will more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that process the surroundings and process the data in seconds .
according to a study published by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , high @-@ automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
nevertheless , driving vehicles in public roads are expected to be expected until 2020 . &quot;
value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German site estimate the authors of the study by 2025 will be roughly 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; says the SPD traffic polit@@ ician S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l .
the question of liability upon accidents and safety of personal data of the driver must be clearly explained .
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday , on the AA pre@@ set by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test facility DE@@ K@@ RA , came to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect it at all in 20 years - 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed by 2025 saw an autonomous vehicle , 33 percent in the US .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the digital network , only seven percent would agree to be controlled during the whole journey on all roads .
on the free@@ way , the flu@@ ent traffic could still be 15 percent , while St@@ au is 45 percent .
well every fourth would leave the car to control under any circumstances .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a very great fashion show and a wax figures : the designer Jean Paul G@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which can be frigh@@ tening up to video projections thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , who was among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he was bald men in skirts .
&quot; I can &apos;t tell you today that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of the hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in former times it was ble@@ ached , it was genuine , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designers has changed his attitude towards a show of his person .
actually he had been , because : &quot; for me it sounded a bit about death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you come into the museum .
the impressive collection had already been at the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; he said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it &apos;s about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into which barely another work of the man who has written fashion history without ever completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically , the vision is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed universal artwork , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ ying to fr@@ ying , for example a styl@@ ist is engaged .
14 tons of material have handled the makers according to the curator , Thierry Meyssan , by Thierry Meyssan , by Thierry Meyssan .
just before the start of the October Festival was a special ker@@ f : a leather pants out@@ fit with cor@@ sa@@ ett .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are s@@ auer as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier says .
G@@ aul &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is also shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender and fashionable walking attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was dressed with his ted@@ dy b@@ HS and clothes , Gaul@@ tier said .
with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
he brought the throw of fashion later he taught himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought it later .
for his first own fashion show he cannot pay the bab@@ es .
they got nothing but allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
previously it went to long stick@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen , to make a metre .
the embro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and lace originated in large amounts of customers , which they worked for example to ceilings and she@@ er curtains .
this does not work anymore today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the E@@ quest@@ rian Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important .
in the beginning of the pl@@ u@@ ener lace fashion played fashion a larger part , was then p@@ atter@@ ed by the Heim@@ tex@@ as Industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt is called some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that insp@@ ires itself to the previous Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , an increasing contractor .
who has no service in the textile industry in Germany is no longer available on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
E@@ quest@@ rian Pl@@ auen is a member of nine further companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener and Em@@ bro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they may carry out the protected label .
over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of the turnover were broken .
there are almost no private shops and wholesale outlets .
our products hardly achieve our customers in this way .
today , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively via chains .
the export , current to Russia and the USA are also weak@@ ened .
so enough reasons for new routes .
the industry association is also attempted to points through environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embro@@ ider@@ y region in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ecological and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
designer Ute Schmidt is teaching at the regional office of the western Sax@@ on College Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ y and tips .
in order to op@@ pose the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories , which need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design is often only varies , to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile design@@ ator Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ formed the historical snow line .
in doing so , the machine suff@@ oc@@ ates small kitchen .
the au@@ sp@@ ener Gold@@ smith in Bianca &apos;s H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ge was inspired by this : &quot; previously I couldn &apos;t start with traditional pl@@ u@@ ener . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ sole for its jewellery .
in an elabor@@ ate technique , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region can identify themselves with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies in the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers who have lived their ancestors in pl@@ ot@@ ting and surroundings and who want to be a reminder .
with this , I see my jewelry as the modern amb@@ ass@@ adors of the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip .

XI p@@ ushes to open the economy bro@@ ader for the world
the economy has to be gradually opened to the outside world to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday to a group that was contra@@ cted with the steering &apos;s steering .
&quot; China should use to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business inv@@ entions , &quot; said he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Executive Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
new boo@@ ths to promote and reforms will bring new moment@@ um and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for entry to market access , relaxation of the border controls policies , con@@ veying of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population .
after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified , which are not subject to investments in question .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance , as it promotes the market a larger part in the allocation of resources , a legally governmental business environment and the market open , said the statement .
the government also checks the controls over those transferred to the company , and to ensure that companies decide how they lead their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border business operation and new mechanisms by promoting regional growth .
within an offer , state controlled sectors open , other areas are open to private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , it is made easier for foreigners who require a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; to ensure the demands of the application and the application process will be facil@@ itated .
the right of attor@@ neys to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leader such as Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli were part of the meeting , as announced in an explanation published after the meetings .
EU aims to double mercury @-@ limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission plans to double the limit for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and consumers in order to achieve a significantly higher dose of the nerve .
the F@@ ood@@ watch Consumer Organization , which is a reasonable tool for the EU , critic@@ ised the plans in sharp : &quot; risks and side effects of industrial and environmental policy are passed on , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the ne@@ ural po@@ ison@@ ous fish are to be raised at the end of the food chain like Hai@@ - or S@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury in kilograms of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly exposed to mercury that , based on the current limit values about 50 per cent of the length should not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be available .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU aims to contam@@ inate the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0,1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch therefore described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fish , such as car@@ p usually very low so low , that they already hold the planned maximum values already today .
the lowering of the cl@@ an@@ ism is , therefore , &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des indul@@ g@@ ation man@@ oeu@@ ver , which helps in the economy , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a high @-@ quality heavy metal , which en@@ rich@@ ly applied on the food chain above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; minor amounts may cause particularly severe damage of the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Commerce declared on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; health threat of the general population &quot; is not expected .
mercury is mainly through the coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written document by the German Federal Ministry of Health , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ ke ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount of Germany em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish around El@@ be , Rhine and Donau was &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; had quoted the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March out of paper .
during the past year , warning from mercury in fish already included the most commonly reported health risks in the R@@ AS@@ FF @-@ warning system .
