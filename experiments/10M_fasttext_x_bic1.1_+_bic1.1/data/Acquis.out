a reaction to blood group determination has to react with all the tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ ol@@ og with the antibodies or another on the label specified .
if a recur@@ r@@ ence is used by the manufacturer , the following factors or appar@@ itions does not occur : a ) ha@@ em@@ ol@@ y@@ tic features .
the tit@@ er is measured by always a re @-@ dil@@ ution of the tests on the double in a suitable medium .
the tit@@ er is the incidence of the number of the strongest serving , in which a reaction occurs ; the dil@@ ution will be calculated exclusively in volume of blood cells in the total volume .
anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time that is necessary for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carriers .
the World Health Organisation has established international standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ent international standards , and for reag@@ ents of other speci@@ fic@@ ity are reported in time standards .
according to definition a specific number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the tit@@ ers , which are observed at individual preparations ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group determination of most speci@@ alities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ iter that observed in a series of dil@@ ations with a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tic flood .
the tit@@ er gives the dil@@ ution of refle@@ cting in the last mixture within a series which occurs a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ tically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination are present ( currently anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ full anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed in comparison to the International standard prepar@@ ative or a state of standards in international units ( See Bulletin , O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 ) .

if a difference is stored under the recommended use by the manufacturer , the necessary features should remain at least one year long .
according to label , the exp@@ iry date of a refund in the label is less than one year after the last satisfactory host test .
based on the label date for dry reag@@ ents , after the results of the ret@@ ace@@ ous tests , it is addressed by the state regulatory authorities .
dry reag@@ ents are kept in a atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or vacuum , while dried in the glass container which they have been dried and so it is closed so that no moisture may enter .
a dry re@@ sign@@ ment may lose the maximum 0,5 @-@ H. of its weight when using further drying of phosphate @-@ pent@@ oxi@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to avoid bacteria growth , the competent authority may determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the delivered solvents ) is added to a ant@@ is@@ ep@@ tic and / or anti@@ bi@@ otic fluid if the reag@@ ent with the added substance remains the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite of speci@@ fic@@ ity and effectiveness .

reag@@ ents , equal whether in fluid form or after rest@@ itu@@ tion , must be transparent and cannot contain se@@ di@@ ments or visible particles .
as long as possible , the international exchange for the international exchange @-@ group @-@ determination are not possible to become artificial , at least as long as long as an international agreement has come into a uniform system .
reag@@ ents for blood @-@ related determination are distributed in such a way and distributed in such amounts , that in a container , it is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also for carrying out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount required in a container must be so large that the content may be used in this protocol to perform tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer @-@ laboratory equipment has over all production stages and insp@@ ections of the reag@@ ent determination in written records .
reasonable samples of all out reag@@ ents are possible to store long from the laboratory of the laboratory until with some probability it is no longer used to be used .
the reag@@ ents of the reag@@ ents can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) of origin ; some of these represent the effective component , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the reag@@ ent .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups according to its effective origin .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ent human origin consist of substances that contain substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable reag@@ ents do not contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black @-@ white printed label in English and French . the following information includes : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,

a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Anti @-@ D serum is simultaneously dissolved in parallel to the un@@ diluted international standard of anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) ser@@ um or equivalent comparison chart compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
