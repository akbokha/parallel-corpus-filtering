this document provides a summary of the European Public commission ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) is assessed by the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) in order to get to recommendations regarding the application of medicines .
if you need more information about your disease or your treatment , please read the package handling ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ies .
if you wish more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for intake levels ( 7.5 mg / ml ) and as a inj@@ ected solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .

A@@ bil@@ let is applied for the treatment of severe severe episodes and pre@@ vent@@ ic episodes for patients who have addressed in the past to the medicine .
injection moulding solution is applied to rapid monitoring of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral medicine is not possible .
for both cases , the solution can be applied to the single or melting tablet in patients who prepar@@ es the swal@@ lowing of tablets .
for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the dose should be removed from as@@ certain@@ ed .
this imp@@ airs signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of ner@@ ve cells each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol probably works especially as &quot; partial ag@@ gression &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but lower than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ gl@@ itter work@@ around the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder occurs with the brain , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol helps to norm@@ alize the activity of brain , creating psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their recur@@ sive symptoms will be avoided .
the effectiveness of as@@ gen@@ eric , the recur@@ sive symptoms of symptoms , was examined in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of injection @-@ related solution was compared to two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or similar conditions that suffered to increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in a further study , A@@ bil@@ ical was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ ical and placebo which had been stabil@@ ized in 160 patients where the symptoms were stabil@@ ized with A@@ bil@@ ical symptoms .
the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ ical inj@@ ected solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered to increased un@@ rest , with the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psychological ) and placebo over a period of two hours compared to placebo .
in all studies the change of symptoms of patients with a standard dial for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body is the melting of the melting , and absor@@ bs the solution .
in both trials , patients who received A@@ bil@@ ical in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger decrease of symptoms of increased rest@@ less@@ ness than the patient receiving a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bil@@ ical in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
in addition , A@@ bil@@ let prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than the placebo in previously treated patients treated with previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bil@@ ical inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg cans were also reduced to placebo than placebo increased un@@ rest and similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of A@@ bil@@ ical ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal distur@@ ban@@ ces ( un@@ controlled ) , ac@@ o@@ deficiency ( nau@@ sea ) , irrit@@ ation , spar@@ sely ID ( increased s@@ ali@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxi@@ ety .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bil@@ ical during treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and during which the lack of man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol came in response to the risks .
Moreover , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection @-@ related distur@@ b@@ ance in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes on bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , when an oral treatment is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . licence for placing on the market of A@@ bil@@ ical in the whole European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is designed for the treatment of a heavy @-@ polar episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly active episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
a increased efficacy of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mono@@ therap@@ ies or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been detected .
with view to the bigger sensitivity of this patient group , lower Initi@@ al dose should be considered to be considered as clinical factors ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is applied to combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the emergence of Sud@@ et@@ ric behaviour is one of the psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ection disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ mental therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting no elevated suc@@ cul@@ um risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ika .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be treated with attention in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ectious disease , cardiovascular disease ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are applied for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sensitive phar@@ maceuticals ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there was an unusual reports during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be drawn into consideration to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if a patient has developed signs and symptoms which led to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without any additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ica must be removed including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was supposed to be in patients with cr@@ amp@@ ons in the an@@ am@@ ese or states that are in connection with cur@@ v@@ eins in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years old , with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ os@@ ene patients who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , an elevated death of death in comparison to the placebo .
there was however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and response to un@@ wanted rov@@ ascular events in treated with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ol .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma , was reported in patients who have been treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated that allow directly .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is observed , or a healthy life of vit@@ ality and could lead to serious complic@@ ations .
due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nerv@@ ous system is careful when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption Rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically un@@ relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ ine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol at 107 % while the C@@ 09 remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) metabolism can result in common use with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensively .
if you consider the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits of potential risks in the patients should be considered .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , must have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions .
after depos@@ ed the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the Dos@@ age height before the start of the companion therapy .
di@@ lem@@ az@@ em or or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be counted with a constant increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentration .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substr@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ot@@ am@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Methodi@@ x@@ ym@@ orph@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tr@@ am@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to al@@ ert their doctor when pregnant or pregnant women during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
due to the in@@ sufficient data security on humans and due to the concerns during the re@@ productive studies , this medication may not be applied in the pregnancy , unless the possible use just@@ i@@ fies the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be warned that dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to use , until they are safe , that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence on it .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant effects ( * ) :
the incidence of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ ins@@ on@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was observed in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.1 % for patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and 15.@@ 1 % was treated with O@@ lan@@ ig@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes on bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was achieved in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
at a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo where potentially significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters resulted in no medi@@ cally significant differences .
the CP@@ I ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ym@@ pt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol patients compared to 2.0 % of the patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ mental therapy , and over their occurr@@ ence even in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the mal@@ ign@@ ited neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ic syndrome , sp@@ aw@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and increased mortality in older de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch were un@@ inten@@ tionally or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without ob@@ serving time .
although there are no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in treating an over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ; it is un@@ likely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis occur in the treatment of an over@@ dosage of benefits because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma proteins .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ rupt through combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and for the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , for the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ pollution and to the hist@@ amine H1@@ N1 .
at the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol at doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed a dos@@ sier from 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor @-@ lig@@ ations , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the Put@@ ting .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study , 52 % of those patients who held a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from measuring instruments intended to be defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Scale , showed a significantly higher improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ized patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ mar@@ z@@ ol group and at 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ der @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included in significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with more flexi@@ bly dose over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed a placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness against placebo .
in two placebo and active mon@@ otherapy studies more than 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed up against placebo in week 3 and an accounting effect which was comparable to the result of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol proved an equivalent percentage of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic remission of the man@@ ie on like Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially refle@@ cting on lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy , refle@@ cting an superior effectiveness in reducing diagnostic symptoms in comparison to mono@@ therap@@ ies with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks followed by a long@@ time extension period of over 74 weeks in various patients , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed up to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of an anti@@ bi@@ polar response .
based on in vitro studies the enzym@@ es CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 for the stretching of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is responsible , the N @-@ De@@ alk@@ yl is generated through CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 cataly@@ tic converter .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol for extensive met@@ abolic applications using CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and at almost 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ener patients showed no gender dependent effects .
a broad calculation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics showed no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the effect of the smo@@ ker on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and de@@ hydr@@ ate Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study involving human liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect as regards the impair@@ ment of the liver function on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and de@@ hydr@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to attract sl@@ ats on their met@@ abolic capacity .

tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of men , so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects recorded a dos@@ sier dependent side deficiency ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accum@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ ym@@ ular cor@@ ps ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 mg / kg / day ) at the recommended maximum dose of ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people ) .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the eradi@@ cation of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose of people from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ) from the recommended maximum dose while people based on mg / m2 .
however , in the human gest@@ ure , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate from hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole not found more than 6 % of the concentrations that were detected in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of vitro sol@@ u@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ x of the mid Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ rupt through combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ der @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included in significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ies more than 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness against placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol as a solution for intake with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in tra@@ ff@@ ing form in healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) depends on an individual clinical status in consideration of the medic@@ inal product or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further leading treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is indicated , see a summary of the features of medicines by AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting tablet or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution .
there are no research on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ ety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different than caused by schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and lack of polar episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ ental therapy with gasoline coding in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ol injection solution is considered necessary , the patients should be observed with respect to extreme maritime or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
research on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution lie in patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical po@@ is@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal medicines ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be treated with attention in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ectious disease , cardiovascular disease ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are applied for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sensitive phar@@ maceuticals ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there was an unusual reports during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate , swe@@ ating and cardiovascular disease ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is observed or a healthy life of vit@@ ality and could lead to serious complic@@ ations .
nevertheless the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was bigger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , in a study where healthy subjects were applied to in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ ent , and received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) at the same time .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is considered as clin@@ ically relevant .
in the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) met@@ abolic applications a common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol at CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ ecting inhibit@@ ors , must have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions .
after depos@@ ed the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the Dos@@ age height before the start of the companion therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) received in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the following side effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ mar@@ z@@ ol injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the incidence of side effects listed below is defined in the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were reported in clinical trials with oral @-@ based Ari@@ pi@@ mar@@ z@@ ol as possible medical relevant effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was compared to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.1 % for patients under placebo .
in another study , over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was observed in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
at a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo where potentially significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters resulted in no medi@@ cally significant differences .
the CP@@ I ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ym@@ pt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol patients compared to 2.0 % of the patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ mental therapy , and over their occurr@@ ence even in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the mal@@ ign@@ ited neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ic syndrome , sp@@ aw@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and increased mortality in older de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles was associated with statistically significant improvements of ag@@ iti@@ oning / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) , 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and behavi@@ our@@ al disorder was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms of ag@@ gression and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed average improvement from the base value on the P@@ AN@@ SS exc@@ itement Compon@@ ent scores in primary 2 @-@ hours end@@ point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gression , a similar effect was observed in terms of the total population , but a statistical significance was observed due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) showed a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the people &apos;s share in response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ ol 77 % ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ized patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) showed significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ der @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , refle@@ cting the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , revealed an superior effectiveness in reducing the reduction of clinical symptoms compared to mono@@ therap@@ ies with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in various patients , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed up to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly during prevention of a bi@@ polar response .
the Ari@@ pi@@ mar@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % greater the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two for@@ cements .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the average time to reach maximum plasma guns at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target body after repeated treatment with a system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were in 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human@@ ist exposure of 30 mg in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ um .
in studies for re@@ productive treatments according to intraven@@ ous application , no safety concerns of matern@@ al exposure , 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) was over the maximum human@@ ist exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) for safety sp@@ har@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated administration , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , com@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the can@@ ter potential have no particular haz@@ ards for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans ; therefore , they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects recorded a dos@@ sier dependent side deficiency ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accum@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ ym@@ ular cor@@ ps ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times the average Ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for people ) .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the eradi@@ cation of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( which is from 1 to 3 times the mean maximum dose dose or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose while people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed according to dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 times the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study enrolled in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters were early as anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( in general administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) containing a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines ( given in combination with other medicines for reduction of side effects ) .
overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
when people were treated for patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the disease and the survival of the disease .
on the other hand , people who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was known as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el included in terms of these indicators .
it may also do not have to be applied to people who have low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic numbers at the beginning of the treatment .
the Medic@@ inal Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was included in patients with which the first treatment was not more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines containing other drugs to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted Ab@@ ra@@ xis Bi@@ os@@ ci@@ ence Limited for placing the placing on the market of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in people where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( Neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic value &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y during the Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y grade 3 , the treatment is to lower until a improvement is reached to level 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with dam@@ aging kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of non @-@ sufficient data for the un@@ certainty and effectiveness .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic@@ ulation formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other for@@ form@@ ations of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
when an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately termin@@ ate and treated a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment , and the patient must not be treated with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no renewed ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be re@@ directed to &gt; 1,5 x 109 / l , and the thro@@ at number has grown to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with det@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
while clearly with ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was not detected in connection with kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardiovascular fail@@ ures are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or under@@ lying heart or lung disease .
if the patients received from ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a can be treated with the usual non @-@ emet@@ ry and con@@ current means .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane should not be used with pregnant or women in a child@@ bearing age that do not use an effective conception , except the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ um@@ eric .
women are able to apply a reliable detection method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is enrich@@ ed , during and up to six months after the treatment is not a child .
male patients should be advised against treatment over a sperm @-@ con@@ sens@@ ing , since the therapy with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertil@@ ity .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) that can be affected by the traffic authority and the ability to serve machines .
listed below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer study once all three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane were treated .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking significant hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was fast rever@@ si@@ bly and dos@@ is@@ fied ; Leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indications ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .

the application of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two introductory studies and 4@@ 54 patients that were treated in a randomised phase III study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in shape of an infusion of about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion in over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 hour infusion with pre@@ medication for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute infusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
when recording to the study , 64 % of patients had a affected general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ elles .
14 % of the patients had no chemotherapy , 27 % had only had a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity versus P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by an improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y grade 3 in a time during therapy .
the natural process of peripheral Neurop@@ ath@@ y for demol@@ ition on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane according to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of the aggregate P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el in accordance with 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute infusion of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 In the intraven@@ ous gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el Plas@@ ma@@ sts took effect in multi@@ phase mode .
the medium distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching exotic distribution and / or small connection from P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intraven@@ ous tum@@ ours of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el using 260 mg / m2 of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing half @-@ grade P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than a solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in vitro trials of human liver micro@@ some and tissues is reported that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is associated with 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zes .
after a 30 @-@ minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative agents was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ abolic rate 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ as , which indicates a far non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is a biological medicine which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also contains the same substance ( also called &quot; Reference Medic@@ ations &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which a blood @-@ trans@@ fusion complic@@ ations could not occur if the intervention is not possible , and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected .
treatment with se@@ duc@@ es must be led under the supervision of a physician , who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with ill@@ nesses that is indicated for the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be performed by the patient or his super@@ vis@@ or , so that they have received a reasonable guide .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al failure , or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ aries should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per employee in adults respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the Iron values of all patients are required before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency is , and iron ore products should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients who receive a chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems can be caused an@@ emia caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ le deficiency or that the body does not suff@@ ice to the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in .
ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by one cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was involved in the formation of ep@@ och@@ et@@ al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to administration as a injection into a v@@ ein in the frame of a main study with 479 patients caused by kidney problems caused an@@ emia .
all patients participated in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene before they were either killed on se@@ duc@@ ts or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the modification of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ aries between the beginning of the study and the completion period in weeks 25 to 29 .
furthermore , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of the skin spec@@ ulated Ab@@ se@@ amed showed that of the treatment of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who were caused by kidney problems caused an@@ emia , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ aries of patients who were put on se@@ duc@@ ers were reck@@ oned on the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients continued to have E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / d@@ dl of the output value from 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally occur as ab@@ rupt , st@@ ing@@ ing mig@@ raine head@@ ache and tur@@ bul@@ ence .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who possibly are ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ep@@ och@@ e@@ al@@ fa or one of the other components .
se@@ f@@ amed as a injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems because other studies are necessary to ensure that these are not an allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for se@@ duc@@ es , according to the regulations of the European Union of proof , it was a comparable quality , safety and economic profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the se@@ amed , is prepared for medical professionals in all Member States information , including information about the safety of medicines .
in August 2007 the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG , a permit for placing on the market of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .

a rise of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ s by more than 2 g / d@@ dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) over a four @-@ week period should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients occasionally , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ aries can be observed or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ - target concentration .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ ability the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in @-@ management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of 10 g / d@@ dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / d@@ dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s exceeds 2 g / d@@ dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / d@@ dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ och@@ on @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be close to safe , in order to ensure that ep@@ och@@ in al@@ fa in the lowest permitted dose , is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ aer@@ ob@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with an extremely low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) might require higher yield doses than patients where the initial deposit is less badly ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .

thus early as possible - for example , a few weeks prior to the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous bloo@@ d@@ work programme - should be started , so before the start of the se@@ duc@@ al therapy great iron reserves are available .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 CPU / kg ep@@ och@@ e@@ al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery procedure and the day of surgery ( day 0 ) should be given .
in this case , ep@@ och@@ in al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 instead / kg each in 10 consecutive days , on the day of intervention and 4 days immediately thereafter .

in case of chronic ren@@ al failure , 8 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentrations should not be exceeded in section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , an increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese stim@@ ulated effici@@ encies ( ESA ) were given to a concentration of over 12 g / d@@ dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
controlled clinical studies did not show any significant benefit from the gift of ep@@ o@@ yst@@ ic concentrations , when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ation exceeds the concentration of an@@ aer@@ ob@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome and avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fusion .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster increase should amount to approximately 1 g / d@@ dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / d@@ dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
patients with chronic ren@@ al failure and clin@@ ically evidence of cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease should not be exceeded in the 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
according to these findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency are not accelerated to accelerate the progression of ren@@ al failure .
in patients with tumor @-@ patients receiving chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ och@@ in @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in response should be considered ( patients who may have to be trans@@ f@@ ited ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize the risk for possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with the goal of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision on application of re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction taking part in the respective patient who should also consider specific clinical context .
patients who are planned for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c procedure should be evaluated if possible , prior to the beginning of ep@@ ic @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and accordingly .
patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive don@@ tic surgery , should have an appropriate thro@@ mb@@ osis proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis , because they have an increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ ous diseases , especially at a level of cardiovascular disease .
furthermore it cannot be excluded , that in the treatment with ep@@ och@@ in al@@ fa for patients with a basic volume of &gt; 13 g / dl can consist of an increased risk for postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cul@@ ature events .
in several controlled studies , for ep@@ ilep@@ sy is not proven that in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia should improve the overall survival or reduce the risk of progression .

the most common adverse effect during the treatment with ep@@ och@@ in al@@ fa is a dos@@ sier dependent growth of blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mb@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ous events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ines .

survival and progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were randomised trials and trials .
in the open study , no difference in overall survival was affected between the patients with re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etic in treated patients and the control patients .
in these studies , Avastin was consistent with recur@@ ring human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etic in treated patients with a premium due to various more frequently col@@ ign@@ ant , statistically significantly higher mortality than in controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complic@@ ations with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etic in treated patients and controls satisfactory .
there is an increased risk for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumour @-@ patients who can be treated with re@@ combin@@ ants of Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etic , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results are treated on the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in for tumor @-@ patients receiving chemotherapy with the goal of transfer a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ aries under 13 g / d@@ dl , since a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .

the holder of approval for placing on the market is obliged to perform the risk management plan listed in the pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ ree , as stated in version 5 of the approval of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as to every subsequent revision of the Risk Management plan .
a updated R@@ MP should be implemented in accordance with the &quot; CH@@ MP Guidel@@ ine on Risk Management System for &quot; Human Use &quot; at the same time with the next updated report on the un@@ certain@@ ity of medicines ( peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , PS@@ UR ) .
Moreover , a updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • In receipt of new information , the influence on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance or the measures to risk reduction could be considered within 60 days after reaching an important ( the Pharmac@@ ology or Risk Assessment )
• In a month before your treatment suffered a heart attack or stroke , if you suffer from un@@ stable Ang@@ ina P@@ ect@@ oris ( for the first time or ampli@@ fied chest pain ) the danger of a blood sugar formation in the v@@ eins ( deep Ven@@ enth@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis ) is - if you had occurred earlier than such a blood sugar
the blood disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( v@@ ascular disease of the cardi@@ ac disease ) or the brain ( cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) would have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with se@@ duc@@ es , it can come back to a slight drop @-@ dependent increase in blood pl@@ ets that will return to other treatment .
their doctor will perform regular blood studies in order to control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment regularly .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ at@@ ol@@ ys@@ is ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12- or fol@@ ates , should be taken into account and treated with se@@ eable jets before the start of the therapy .

if you suffer from Er@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ ast@@ open@@ ia , it will break your therapy with f@@ ooth@@ es and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , se@@ duc@@ ts have to be given through injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if it is treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to a kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value the risk for problems with the heart or blood vessels could be increased and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing potassium , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with se@@ duc@@ ts , until the potassium values are in the norm@@ ality range .
if you suffer chronic ren@@ al weakness and clin@@ ically obvious heart disease , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s will not exceed a certain value .
according to these findings , the treatment of blood vessels with se@@ duc@@ ts in adults with chronic ren@@ al sw@@ elling ( kidney failure ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al failure .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ och@@ in @-@ al@@ fa @-@ free and the desired effect should be considered for the evaluation of the effectiveness of se@@ duc@@ es .
200 Your doctor regularly determine your values of red blood @-@ colour ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and maintain your se@@ eable dose as possible to keep the risk of a blood sugar ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ical event ) .
this risk should have been very carefully derived from treatment with ep@@ och@@ rome vas@@ cul@@ ous events , especially if you have an elevated risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cul@@ ous events , e.g. if you have occurred in ob@@ ese ( adi@@ po@@ ison@@ ous ) or if you have occurred in the past , thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ di@@ mb@@ osis or lung em@@ bo@@ lie ) .
if you are cancer patients , you think that Ab@@ se@@ amed affects the growth factor for blood cells and some circumstances may affect the tumour in certain circumstances .
if a major orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery is im@@ min@@ ent , the treatment of your an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the treatment starts .
if your values are too high for red blood cells ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) , you should not receive se@@ amed because an increased risk for blood sugar after surgery exists .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is applied for the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after the exchange years and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high level of fra@@ ction ( bone damage ) , including those who have suffered a slight temper@@ ed hip as at hat@@ red ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease which changes the normal course of the bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should be at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with stro@@ be should be taken before the first infusion with a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 I@@ U ) , or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( funds against inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , in the three days after the infusion of symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pped symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ ometric , a part of the data material for Z@@ ig@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ rates and hip fra@@ c@@ tures were investigated over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis more than 50 years , who had been recently explo@@ red for a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in total of 357 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was , whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme , which builds bone remains ) in the blood , norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared with the initial value .
in the study of older women the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ it@@ edi@@ atri@@ cal ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ it@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) with those under Placebo the risk of stro@@ kes was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with stro@@ ked rates 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 by 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less frequent in the inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may not be used in patients who possibly have op@@ pressed ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ onate or one of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is subject to the risk of kidney difficulties , reactions to the infusion place and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissues ) in a pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides re@@ conn@@ aissance material for doctors , informed A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients where the side effects of the drugs should be explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended an intraven@@ ous infusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a once a year .
patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic stro@@ ller is recommended by the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operative supply of the stro@@ be ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by physicians , experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long @-@ emission period was observed in patients who have addressed to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly efficient , in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . ( see Section 4.4 ) .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic stro@@ be is recommended by an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. neutral or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular vitamin D before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ infusion .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with ren@@ al functional distur@@ b@@ ance ( see paragraph 4.4 ) In patients with a cancer @-@ arg@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as a limited clinical experience for these patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose rate is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of older patients similar to younger is similar .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use with children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data are missing and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cancer in@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia should be treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the onset of therapy ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid integration of the effect of zinc @-@ hydro@@ chlor@@ ic acid on bone structure can develop a temporary basis in sympt@@ om@@ atic mort@@ cal@@ ine , their maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is highly efficient , in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . ( see Section 4.2 ) .

for patients who need dental implants are no data available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ cable in the pine area .
the clinical assessment by the treatment doctor should be the basis for treatment plan of any patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the prevalence of severe adverse events reported by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 852 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ ate Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) , the total th@@ reading between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .

ren@@ al trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ hydro@@ chlor@@ ic acid was treated with ren@@ al dysfunction , which is expressed as a decrease of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase of the serum ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the creation of cancer @-@ arg@@ ance ( measured before the administration ) and the emergence of kidney failure , and a reduced kidney function , were similar in a clinical study at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary rise of the serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of treated patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with placebo .
based on the rating of the laboratory technology , the temporary calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , at 2.3 % of treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % associated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to avoid clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after rap@@ proch@@ ement and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the number of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local responses to the infusion of infusion , g@@ elling , sw@@ elling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tics , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic section ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including c@@ ol@@ ed@@ eic acid , were treated .
many of these patients had indication of local infections including oste@@ o@@ itis , and the majority of reports about cancer patients after tooth replacement or other records .

in case of an over@@ dosage , which leads to a clinical relevant mort@@ cal@@ ine , may be achieved through the gift of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous infusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was achieved in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone mar@@ mal@@ ine or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the pain k@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ rates .
effects on morph@@ ological verteb@@ rates A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed significantly over a period of three years as well as already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk for bo@@ ast@@ ically fra@@ c@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hat@@ red fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reported a constant effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip fra@@ c@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo @-@ treatment significantly to all ages ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ asing of the bone density of the lum@@ bar sp@@ ine increased by 6.7 % , the total hi@@ ps by 6.0 % , the increase of the threshold by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
Kno@@ ch@@ enh@@ ist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vic .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ et@@ ric ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo an increase of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone @-@ volumes and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone mar@@ i@@ potenti@@ ary phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d type ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 517 to 1,@@ 246 patients in perio@@ dic@@ ally intervals during study duration .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value for 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value of 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value for 36 months .
the vitamin D mirror was not measured without rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the infusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to the placebo treatment with BM@@ D at the overall th@@ igh and scra@@ per in all points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment caused over 24 months in comparison to the placebo treatment to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total and 4.3 % on the scra@@ per sphere .
in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study , 508 were randomised , and 185 patients received the BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % when compared to placebo .
in another study in men ( CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was based on the percentage change of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , based on the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light @-@ heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone tumor ( median serum ) of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ fold in age @-@ specific normal value when recording to the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ hydro@@ chlor@@ ic acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg of risk cartridge once daily during 2 months was detected in two six months of comparative studies .
in the combined results after 6 months , a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain k@@ ill@@ ation was observed , compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified at the end of the six @-@ month main study as a Respon@@ sibility ( to the treatment ) were included in a follow @-@ up period .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with fra@@ c@@ ron@@ ate patients treated at the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic concern could be kept in 141 of the treated patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron treatment , compared with 71 of the postoperative follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 m@@ g. of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data based on dos@@ ages .
after that the plasma spot rapidly increased to &lt; 10 % of the highest value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , not exceeding 0,1 % of the highest value .

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients suffering from obes@@ ity ( body Mass index - BMI ) of 30 kg / m ² or over and ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or higher ) and beyond one or more .
in addition , four trials were conducted at over 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used compared to placebo as well as supporting funds for setting the smo@@ ker .
the studies for the adjustment of the smo@@ kers showed no consistent results , so the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA were difficult to estimate on this application .
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? s The most common adverse events of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA , which were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper breath@@ s . ng The full list of adverse events reported in connection with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA .

SSE over@@ l@@ ent patients as well as in patients with obes@@ ity was examined and furthermore at 3800 patients in further indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) demonstrated un@@ wanted effects in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients who were treated with weight reduction and due to accompanying met@@ abolic diseases .
however , if the incidence was statistically significantly higher than corresponding effects of placebo ( for un@@ wanted effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ wanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . ng With the evaluation of side effects , the following Frequ@@ encies are found :
very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rarely ( ≥ 0.01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very often l@@ ä
only slight symptoms were observed in a toler@@ ant study , in which a limited number of persons indicated from up to 300 mg were observed .
the patients had a BMI of 30 kg / m ² or BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² and one at the same time as hyper@@ tension and / or dys@@ li@@ pi@@ d .
n weight reduction after one year was for A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference between -@@ 4.9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) .

the percentage of patients who achieved a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % , was 51 % in the pic@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
the difference of the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.001 ) .
improvement of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken over 20 mg , were about 50 % due to the effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % due to the weight reduction explained .
for two hours , the Ste@@ ady @-@ State plasma spot were achieved after 13 days ( C@@ max = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ tr@@ ug@@ h = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14,@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 268 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) .

a summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Business Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which will be assessed by the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to get to recommendations regarding the application of medicines .
Ac@@ counts is applied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent ) patients ( especially overweight patients ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabet@@ ic medicine ) is not performed . • It can be used together with another diabet@@ ic medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition , it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that can not be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fi@@ yl@@ sal@@ n@@ ant or ins@@ ulin , the old dose of the sulph@@ ate resin amount or ins@@ ulin can be maintained with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar level ) , except for patients with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the amount of the sulph@@ ate content / ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin is better util@@ ized and the blood sugar level decreases , so that type 2 diabetes can be better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fi@@ yl@@ sal@@ ac , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cop@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible to reduce blood glucose levels when using doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of additional administration of action contributed to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ ate material in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was examined in 289 patients , the patients who received Ac@@ t@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.14 % in the patients who took placebo in addition .
the most common adverse events in connection with Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , infections of the upper respiratory trac@@ ts , weight gain and hypo@@ thesis ( reduced sensitivity to maturity ) .
Ac@@ counts may not respond to patients that may not react to patients that may not react to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabet@@ ic K@@ eto@@ ia ( high blood levels - acid ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ cars should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in for patients where Met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for placing action in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white until wh@@ it@@ ish , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and carry on a side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also shown for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficient with ins@@ ulin in@@ sufficient and in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are end@@ anger@@ ed by at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or eyel@@ ids , particularly those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and eyel@@ ids are observed when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular disease study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ ular disease has been carried out .
in this study demonstrated an increase of reports on heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output current ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm range ) or with other signs of a liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the norm@@ ality are increased , the liver parameters are as soon as possible .
if such patient symptoms have developed to hin@@ der a h@@ ep@@ atic irrit@@ ability , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ ment , ti@@ red@@ ness , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver parameters .
the decision on whether the treatment of the patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be continued until the procedure of the laboratory parameters should be directed by the clinical evaluation .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ sier dependent weight gain was proven that can be stir@@ red from fat deposits and related in some cases with a liquid sample .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ l@@ ution , under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a minor reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ ance ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of the increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity , patients who have pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as a two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with a sulph@@ ate combination with ins@@ ulin , the risk of a dos@@ is@@ depend@@ ant hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
following the market launch , thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ces , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported using an appearance or deteri@@ oration of a diabet@@ ic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but linked doctors should report to the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered to be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages un@@ desirable events concerning bone arri@@ es from randomised , controlled , dual @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
the proj@@ ect@@ ancy rate was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures in 100 patients with women who were treated with a reference medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular disease , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures in 100 patients ) with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures in 100 patients ) with patients who were treated with a reference medication .
patients should be aware of pregnancy , if one patient wishes for a pregnancy or who occurs this is the treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of the inter@@ actions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmaceutical industry of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ color , Phen@@ pro@@ Cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .

the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one to 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ an@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin @-@ resistant inf@@ ins of matern@@ al substr@@ ates and reduces the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for red@@ dish growth .

these lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens as well as in other hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ tic agents .
there were AL@@ T @-@ Anst@@ ents in clinical trials over three times the upper limit of the norm@@ alization beyond placebo , however more rarely than in comparative groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ sal@@ as .

in the over a period of 3.5 years of current pro@@ active study , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) who were treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) who were treated with a comparative study .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day had no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to effect over a activation of specific kernel acceptance ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity of liver , grease and sk@@ el@@ eton mus@@ cul@@ cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver , and the peripheral happiness increases in case of ins@@ ulin @-@ resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as a mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years in order to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic efficiency ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) after two years after therapy was determined by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was recruited in spite of three @-@ month optim@@ isation , with ins@@ ulin had to be random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continue to receive non @-@ ins@@ ulin , a reduction of the ins@@ ulin p@@ ation in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one group was observed .
clinical trials over one year showed a statistically significant decline in the album / cra@@ at@@ in@@ ine source in comparison to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mono@@ therap@@ ies with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week study on type 2 diabet@@ ic tests .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma @-@ tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels and slightly but clin@@ ically significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ ol des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
compared to placebo , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one there was no statistically significant increase in LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d reduced values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the wet tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this is an effect on tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as on the ep@@ ic tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were randomised in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to an existing anti@@ diabet@@ ic and cardiovascular disease .
according to oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is res@@ or@@ ously absorbed , whereby the top con@@ cent@@ ric concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is usually reached for 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in roughly three times of the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in Inter@@ action Studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmaceutical industry of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ color , Phen@@ pro@@ Cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
according to oral application of radioactive waste pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in the f@@ ooth@@ ache ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elim@@ ination period of the un@@ altered dum@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active met@@ abolic syndrome is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in healthy subjects in patients with reduced kidney function , but resem@@ ble the rates of the or@@ atory Clear@@ ance of the parent .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , pursuant to repeated administration volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ l@@ ution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac disease .
this is due to the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ an@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin @-@ resistant and increased ins@@ ulin subsi@@ dies for red@@ dish growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , hyper@@ pl@@ asia suffer from hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( with male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epithel@@ ium .

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be used in patients who possibly are ins@@ ens@@ itive to ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can result in blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for placing on the market of action in the entire European Union .
when two types of ins@@ ulin are mixed , the amount of the rapidly acceler@@ ating ins@@ ulin must first be recorded , then the amount of a long acting ins@@ ulin .
3 If when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in patients a dose rate is required , it may be necessary in the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
prior to travel , which should go over more time zones , the patient should be noted that ins@@ ulin and meals must be applied to other times , ins@@ ulin and meals to other times must be applied .
5 General disorders and complaints on the administration fee resp@@ ects - Local sur@@ sensitive relation to the inj@@ ections during the ins@@ ulin is able to perform local gra@@ vit@@ ational measures ( tube , sw@@ elling , it@@ rust , pain and ha@@ emat@@ om at the injection point ) .
diabet@@ ics should therefore always be concentrated abund@@ antly , swe@@ ets , cookies or sugar fruit juice with either in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Gl@@ uc@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an incorporated relief measures or by glucose , which is administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mol / l ) with 204 diabet@@ ic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabet@@ ic patients showed that an intraven@@ ous acet@@ one induced norm@@ ality ( blood sugar 4,4 - 6.1 m@@ mol / l ) reduced the mortality rate by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours , and the total duration of the activity is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist profile of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d was studied in a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabet@@ ic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , however , the assum@@ ption is close that pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist profile in children and adolescents is similar to adults .
infusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in concentrations 0.05 g / ml - 1,0 i.e. / ml ins@@ ulin is human in the inf@@ usions of 0.9 % sodium chloride , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D glucose in polypropylene at room temperature for 24 hours .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied in patients who have already have signs of cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in the joints ) or gyp@@ sum no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; ) . larger u@@ rat@@ ers , which can lead to money and bone damage .
if the ure@@ ical tile is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ imal after two to four weeks , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months still tox@@ ins may occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients have at least taken more medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for prevention of tox@@ icity .
the drug is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo patients ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ions ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied to a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary tract was in the blood by the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of those who were Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of those who were once daily 120 mg , during the last three measurements a ure@@ tic tank in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under@@ taking placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , patients with heart failure in prehistoric times may also affect an increased risk of certain side effects , aff@@ ecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering blood cholesterol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with heart and blood vessels could be found .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic emia in diseases that have already led to u@@ rat@@ abl@@ ation ( including one from the patient history of known or currently available for Gi@@ cht@@ k@@ not@@ ens and / or Gi@@ cht@@ arthritis ) .
if the serum har@@ ness of the serum is still more &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase can be considered to be considered as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney limitations , the efficacy and safety have not yet been examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and young people since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the use of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
due to organ transplan@@ recept@@ ors , the application of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ pri@@ zed cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other hard acid resistance , it can come to an acute gyp@@ sum during treatment starting in treatment , because the lowering of the serum levels may first be mobil@@ ized in the tissue .
B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ i Ny@@ han syndrome ) an absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the ur@@ ine of rare cases to rise to a storage in ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease During clinical trials in phase 3 , light contra@@ di@@ lig@@ ations of the liver function was observed in treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended , before the initial treatment course and in the course of the clinical examination a liver function was performed ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ oph@@ yl@@ line Z@@ u were not carried out in exchange studies to Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , but it is well known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or can lead to a rise of the@@ oph@@ yl@@ line ( a inhibit@@ ing of the@@ oph@@ yl@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
at subjects the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ x 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors did not be associated with clinical significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ etri@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / war@@ far@@ in Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without that a dose adaptation for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or the other active substance is required .
in a study with subjects were 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x a medium 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 substr@@ ate , which indicates a possible weak yield effect of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be demonstrated that the simultaneous dosage of ant@@ acids contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the intake of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decline in the C@@ max by 32 % , but does not cause significant alter@@ ation of the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies don &apos;t leave any adverse events of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at to the pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experiments performed un@@ related to direct or indirect harmful effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .

7 Off@@ ered long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies were treated either for up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years had been treated with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during the long @-@ term - renewal @-@ related events were similar to those found in the phase 3 trials ( see table 1 ) .
the following previously treated events were reported in all re@@ lin@@ ux@@ e@@ at@@ - treatment groups in total more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ time extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the information referred to .

the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study of the proportion of patients with which the last three months of particular serum levels were &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ um@@ or@@ in@@ ine value at the beginning of study ( bas@@ eline ) of ≤ 1.5 mg / dl or 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum con@@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) for the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily with commonly used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the act @-@ results showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as compared to the treatment with conventional treatment Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the serum pole increased to &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) during the physician attendance in week 2 and maintained continuously across the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum in@@ con@@ dens@@ ate values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney control unit The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney control ( d. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was measured at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to the percentage process of the serum concentration of serum concentration , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with serious ren@@ al dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum sal@@ ari@@ ous concentrations of 10 mg / dl ( 40 % of patients ) had taken together a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L to study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in the incidence of tox@@ ins showed that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 had required a treatment against an explosion protection ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients ) required for a tox@@ ins .
this was associated with a reduction of the Gi@@ cht@@ k@@ not@@ ary size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the gyp@@ sum up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ W values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open @-@ time extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ cent@@ ric Time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at increased easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg of dos@@ is@@ oned .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg will be observed for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at a rise of AU@@ C which is greater than the dos@@ si@@ proportional increase .
after taking easier or multiple oral doses between 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2,8 @-@ 3,2 µg / ml and 5,0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease of serum concentration , unless this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ s@@ s / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma links of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary con@@ flu@@ ence of Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is achieved over the concentration of concentration , which is achieved with doses ranging from 80 to 120 mg .

the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or take other medicines ( including ant@@ acids da , calcium and vit@@ amine supplement ) .
in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down after the first dietary intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
da Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in medicines referred to in the European Union , based on data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D mirrors .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror was treated in patients that had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than those who were only in Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data that it is contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dosage , exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digest@@ ion apparatus such as abdom@@ inal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ ort ( mal@@ formation ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( tur@@ bul@@ ence ) , D@@ ord@@ e ( Ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ spher@@ o@@ ia ( swal@@ lowing ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ( bl@@ otted belly ) , as well as sour cream .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids da , calcium and vit@@ amine supplement ) for the day .
the following references are exactly to abide in order to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swal@@ lowed up only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patient must not drop the tablet or the tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first dietary intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

the doctor therefore shall be atten@@ tive to all signs and symptoms , which should be noted on possible radi@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and the patients should be noted on the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ant vi@@ ations such as dy@@ spher@@ ag@@ ie , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ sp@@ at@@ ern@@ al pain or new or dis@@ car@@ ing the medicine ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ ign@@ ant effects would be increased in patients that do not take the medicine under correct and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that point on an ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ages of the patients are improved and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , rarely ( after market introduction ) Mag@@ en- and Du@@ an@@ al@@ op@@ zer@@ a , among them some serious concerns and complic@@ ations , reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ros@@ is of the pine trees , usually in connection with a tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ o@@ itis ) , was reported mainly intraven@@ ous for cancer patients , whose therapy was administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ous .
there are no data available which indicate whether the removal of a bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who need a surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ros@@ is of the pine trees .
the clinical assessment due to the treatment doctor is crucial for treatment of treatment in any patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the patients should be noted that they should be taken during the failure of taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after they noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on the same day .
other disorders that affect the mineral change ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ v ) , should be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the start of the therapy .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some or@@ als can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at when they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken together with a variety of usually used phar@@ maceuticals without clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for application with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore neither apply to pregnant women during pregnancy .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered adult patients who tran@@ spl@@ ant a kidney or liver to prevent a dis@@ mis@@ sal of tran@@ spl@@ ant transplan@@ tation by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company submitted the results of previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study was presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients where transplan@@ tation was cancelled after treatment duration of one year ( looking for example , as often as a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a re @-@ recording of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
furthermore , shorter studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant were performed and examined as in advance to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .
tre@@ mor ( lemon ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea / vom@@ iting , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ) , diabetes , multiplied potassium content of blood ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) and ins@@ om@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with lots of hy@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , mac@@ ro@@ id antibiotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in ) or one of the other components may not be used .
patients and doctors have to be careful if others ( especially some vegetable ) drugs can be taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f as the Adv@@ ance dose or the dose should be adapted accordingly to the same time .

only doctors who are familiar with immune @-@ intensive therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant spati@@ ations should be placed this medication or make changes in immune diseases .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft reactions or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ tak@@ ings or immun@@ ity .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the narrow control in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a consequence of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be primarily based on the clinical evaluation of deriv@@ ative and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ reflective regulations ( see below &quot; recommendations
after the switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f you should control the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ar level in front of the conversion and via two weeks after switching .
on Day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both for@@ ums and kidney transplan@@ tations .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ar is recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in immediate re@@ transplan@@ tation phase .
da Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , can take a custom@@ ization of the Adv@@ ance Dos@@ is@@ diag@@ as several days until the Ste@@ ady State reaches .
if the state of the patient in the first postoperative phase no oral medicine is permitted , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be derived intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an infusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress the transplan@@ tation must be maintained ; consistent if therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy should not be specified .
dose recommendations - Tran@@ splan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ tation The or@@ ale Adv@@ ance Therap@@ y should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift at the morning .
further dose adap@@ table can be later required , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ ization of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation The or@@ ale Adv@@ ance therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift at the morning .
dosage recommendation - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be changed from a daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f at once daily dosage of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant after conversion from other immun@@ om@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day the treatment with the recommended initi@@ al and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant are recommended for proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft reactions .
cardi@@ ac tran@@ spl@@ ant In adult patients that are converted to Adv@@ anc@@ ards , an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is to be taken once a day .
other tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers although there is no clinical experience with C@@ rad@@ le for pneum@@ onia , pan@@ cre@@ as and mut@@ ually transplan@@ ted patients , came in an oral initi@@ ating dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intest@@ inal transplan@@ tation in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adap@@ ts in special patient groups with reduced liver function For maintaining Bl@@ utt@@ le@@ mirror in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with heavy liver function .
patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function ex@@ erts no effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum cruci@@ ble ) is recommended to calculate the amount of canc@@ er@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary .
change@@ over from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f At conversion from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ - to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is caution ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the Tal@@ ar level in the whole blood The dosage should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of dis@@ mis@@ sal and toler@@ ability in individual cases under in@@ feed of whole blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ valley controls .
it is recommended to conduct frequent controls in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ ar @-@ mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be inspected according to Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ f , dos@@ ages , modifications of immune depression treatment or simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentrations ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since there is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , there may be several days , even until the Ste@@ ady State entered the medicine .
the data in clinical trials should make sure that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the tal@@ low levels should not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the T@@ alt@@ itudes of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are usually in the blood of liver tran@@ spl@@ ant usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with ex@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance of liver and kidney transplan@@ tation , blood concentrations in the field of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ ts , or other side effects , which may occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposition .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the narrow control of one medicine in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of growing patients with gra@@ ft reactions , that have proven to other immun@@ om@@ ress@@ ants as a therap@@ ist , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Adv@@ anc@@ ers .
for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the tran@@ spl@@ ant gra@@ ft during adult cardi@@ ac gra@@ fts and transplan@@ ts still have no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of C@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible interaction , which can lead to a down@@ force of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of plant medic@@ ations included , or other plants , during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentration in blood is offered as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subjected to such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a group of group or sept@@ um @-@ hyper@@ t@@ rophy was observed , which therefore may occur in advance at the agra@@ f under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are already existing cardi@@ ac suffering , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , liquid over@@ loading and oil .
as with other immun@@ oh@@ res@@ si@@ va , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin due to appropriate clothing or using a protection factor with a high protective factor .
if patients who take the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of P@@ res such as head@@ aches , changing consciousness , forces and vision should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since H@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , l@@ act@@ ose is contained in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ al Gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption particular attention .
simultaneous use of medic@@ inal or vegetable medic@@ inal products , which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore reduce blood values from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore advis@@ able to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels with simultaneous gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain even more exc@@ essive concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was with anti@@ gly@@ ot@@ ica such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ bi@@ anti@@ bi@@ otic Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics studies that the increase in blood levels mainly resulting from the increased bio availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , resulting from the inhibit@@ or of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal rein@@ forcement .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in case of acute di@@ vor@@ cement , can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 using your metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us set down the cle@@ aring of ster@@ oid counter@@ tiv@@ a and therefore increase the Hor@@ mon@@ exposition in order to avoid over@@ ly anticip@@ ation measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ti@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and can extend its half life .
the results of a small number of investigations to tran@@ spl@@ ant spati@@ ations do not provide evidence that tac@@ ne@@ lim@@ us in comparison to other immun@@ oh@@ res@@ si@@ va an increased risk for un@@ desirable events in view of the course and outcome of pregnancy .

factors such as a lower ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fra@@ ction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or caused by treatment with cor@@ r@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids at higher Clear@@ ance rates are to be responsible for transplan@@ tation .
this makes it possible to complete that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed before the separation , whereby the separation is mainly via the G@@ alle .
for stable patients who have been changed from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose , the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .

Adv@@ ate is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital bleeding ) .
the dosing and frequency of the application indicate whether they were used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding associated with surgical intervention .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from factor VIII lack , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems like bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa will not extract from human plasma , but is lab@@ elled as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by one cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was involved in the formation of the human Gerber factor VIII .
Adv@@ ates is a different drug approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , unlike , is unlike differently , so the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe severe H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ilia A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drugs is examined as prevention of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age and surgical intervention .
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ oc@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; evaluated .
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ oc@@ ate ( observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , p@@ ains ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be applied in patients who possibly have op@@ pressed ( allergic ) against human Gerber factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for placing the placing on the market in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution is done after the sever@@ ity of factor VIII , after the place and the magn@@ itude of blood and clinical state of patients .
at the following h@@ äm@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII activity should not drop below the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and the acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of patients passed away .
during treatment course , for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections a reasonable determination of factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ tile is enrich@@ ed .
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their response to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery and have different half tones .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma has not achieved , or if the bleeding is not ruled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out to im@@ itate an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the dosing rate should not be exceeded after loading the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ at@@ orial activity by factor VIII made by Ig@@ G Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ in who are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma .
the risk of developing in@@ hibition , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ cav@@ ities is most dependent on the largest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ tras and an@@ am@@ ne@@ ak @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after change@@ over from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product was observed on another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( lower tit@@ res ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare ear@@ ching of ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A , women lie above the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and nurs@@ ing time .
the incidence of incidence of A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who were all treated in previously untreated patients who had a higher risk for formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients ( 234 ) calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) ( b ) The unexpected waste of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII mir@@ ro@@ es occurred in post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE infusion fusion .
blood co@@ ag@@ ulation was calculated during the time and factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed adequate values on the 15 . postoperative day .

furthermore , there was none of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) by prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) to a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study showed 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treatment inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of con@@ am@@ amin@@ ating proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statistically significant upward improvement as well as a persist@@ ence peak of the anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms , which refers to an allergic reaction or a hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity .
four patients were dis@@ closed on the occurr@@ ence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , Haut@@ es and increased number of os@@ in@@ oph@@ ile gran@@ ul@@ o@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions .

based on the list of available data , the CH@@ MP has continued to have a positive rating , but consider that the safety profile is closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP based on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a sub@@ mitting PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation procedure should apply for another 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited transferred to the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company receives its application for approval of the application of H@@ air@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Women men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the chest , brain , bones or wheat rop@@ es ( tissues , the other structures in the body are connected , surro@@ unds and support ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that is genet@@ ically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which was changed so that there was no copies of itself and thus unable to trigger pressure in humans .
advanced in the tum@@ ours have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and to form the cancer cells that once again form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein that is formed from not def@@ ective in the human body using p@@ 53 gene , usually carries the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be recovered .
at Li @-@ wom@@ men@@ i cancer , where p@@ 53 gene is faul@@ ty , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the cancer cells can grow up and share .
the company submitted data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Women men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ building , in the bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP &apos;s answers to the questions submitted to him , still some questions were un@@ explained .
based on the initially submitted documents , CH@@ MP was created on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , not suff@@ iciently demonstrated that injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors has advantages to the patient .
the Committee further concerns relating to the processing of medicines in the body , the manner of administration as well as the safety of drugs .
in addition , the company had not enough proven that advanced in a reliable way can be manufactured , and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient .
the company does not having regard to CH@@ MP , whether it has rel@@ ying consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergi@@ es ( loc@@ ust@@ o@@ gens , caused by an allerg@@ y to poll@@ en inflamm@@ ation of the nose ) in patients with mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( g@@ ged nose ) in patients .
for adults and adolescents ages 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ ob@@ aze twice a day one tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( hidden nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drugs can be found on the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the loc@@ ust@@ ter@@ ity re@@ pt@@ ome , reported by the patients prior to the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
cont@@ est@@ ation of the nose reported regarding the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose reported the patients receiving aer@@ ob@@ aze , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.9 % in patients receiving P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under@@ took a decrease of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who was des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine alone .
the most common adverse events of aer@@ ob@@ ars ( observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate ( heart failure ) , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( thro@@ mb@@ osis ) , tox@@ icity , ti@@ red@@ ness , ti@@ red@@ ness , ti@@ red@@ ness , ti@@ red@@ ness , ins@@ om@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ akia may be used in patients who possibly have op@@ pressed ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ rin , P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other parts , against ad@@ ore active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another drug for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) .
Aer@@ bl@@ aze should also be used in patients that have been used in a Eng@@ age @-@ angle ( elevated ocular pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ ose ( hyper@@ tension of thy@@ ro@@ id ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension of thy@@ ro@@ id ) or a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic attack ( caused by a brain blood ) or a risk for ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic attack .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for the placing on the market of aer@@ ob@@ aze in the whole European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , it is possible to swal@@ low up or cut off .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in case of the absence of data to the un@@ certainty and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after cl@@ auses of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use of application to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can take the activity of P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
after reduction in sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper air@@ ways , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be continued as a mono@@ therap@@ ist .
da Aer@@ un@@ aze P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , also contains con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ kers such as Bro@@ ken cri@@ pit@@ ations , per@@ oral or nas@@ al as ab@@ ov@@ arian agent , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rin , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective , and the data are not sufficient to add appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
safety and the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data are not sufficient to add appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
patients must be informed about it that the treatment at the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , nau@@ sea or similar other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of the head@@ aches ) must be set .
in case of the following patient groups to be careful : • patients with cardiovascular disease • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , Diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus , bladder and bronze medal in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as Anti@@ hist@@ amine can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reaction and reduce their magn@@ itude .
in addition to clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in addition , ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered , but were observed no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or alter@@ ations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
in the results of the psych@@ ologists testing , no significant differences were detected between those with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the placebo treated with placebo , regardless of whether it was des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzyme was not yet identified so that interaction with other drugs can not be excluded .
in @-@ vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 does not in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ sights of the application of aer@@ ob@@ aze while pregnancy is not backed up with a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase of frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the prevalence of normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals do not always be transferred to humans and based on the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ction properties of P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , aer@@ ob@@ aze should not be applied in the pregnancy .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied however , that in very rare cases it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to a impair@@ ment of per@@ ti@@ ghtness , or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms may vary between a Z@@ RNA depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a Z@@ NS stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ tures ) with possible let@@ tering .

a Z@@ NS stim@@ ulation is particularly likely with children as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dried , P@@ up@@ ill@@ ary and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stic cells / b@@ oph@@ ile and also the expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in an individual dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement values including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective battles or the tasks that are associated with the fly .
in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of phar@@ maceuticals in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage can cause more lik@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or manifest@@ ations of a c@@ NS path@@ ogen .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients at the age between 12 and 78 years with seas@@ onally allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , where 414 patients received Aer@@ bl@@ aze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine ant@@ agon@@ ist effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ aze tablets , determined from the total score for sympt@@ om@@ atic ( except nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ ist over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ aze tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membrane , was significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ ist over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in respect to gender , age or ethnic origin .

A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal gen@@ ic r@@ hin@@ itis and two trials in patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by adding the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ ling , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) and after six weeks of treatment .
other studies have been submitted to verify that the body does the sy@@ rup , the solution to insert and melting the processed tablet in the same manner as the tablets and use in children un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
in an allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of sympt@@ om scores ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo .
in both studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the decrease of the sympt@@ om volume after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who possibly have op@@ pressed ( allergic ) against deser@@ ted adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for placing A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to reduce the symptoms of allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent organic Rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience of clinical studies for efficacy in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine with adolescents aged from 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic Rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease @-@ loss and can be resum@@ ed after the demol@@ ition of the symptoms and their re@@ alities are resum@@ ed .
using persistent organic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patients can be recommended during the allerg@@ y time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , where ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ology study was in@@ treated with am@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the high @-@ performance effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied however , that it may occur in very rare cases that can result in severe impair@@ ment or ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose of 5 mg 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us reported than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that were reported commonly reported than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dried ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common adverse events occurred , which occurred in 5.9 % of the patients who were treated with deser@@ ted adin and in 6.9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
in a multiple dose study , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were observed , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the isolation of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stic cells / b@@ oph@@ ile and also the expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
under a clinical study with multiple doses , in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg taken daily over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ology study , in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the neo @-@ times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ intervals .
in case of a single dos@@ sier , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement values including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective battles or the tasks that are associated with the fly .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ating of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching gra@@ ins of nose , Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , lac@@ ri@@ cane and ro@@ cking of eyes and it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic Rhin@@ itis can be divided in dependence on the duration of symptoms , alternatively in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic Rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic Rhin@@ itis is defined as an occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis is defined as an occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
how the total of the questionnaire was shown for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden of allergic sensiti@@ v@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was also examined for further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the under@@ lying path@@ ology of path@@ ology resp@@ ects the body similar to different forms and chronic patients can be recruited as a simple pro@@ spect@@ ator .
since the history of the history is a physical factor in all ur@@ inal diseases is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also expected to improve the symptoms of chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ m@@ oods and the amount of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine , chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , from the study .
improvement of the it@@ ching around more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of the patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and wax significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point rating for evalu@@ ating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist study , in which the patients were similar to the general seasonal allergic sensiti@@ itis , was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no applications for clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , this enzyme responsible for the met@@ abol@@ ism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ad@@ resses was not yet identified so that interaction with other drugs will not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine hem@@ med in vivo non @-@ CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ sier with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 7.5 mg as meals ( fet@@ al @-@ rich breakfast ) does not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
treatment with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ adin carried out pre@@ clinical trials , with a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to the tox@@ icity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and from Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated administration , com@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive recovery , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has no particular haz@@ ards for men .

in June 2008 Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially distributed with the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company receives its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people for the protection against influenza , which is caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a strain of flu virus that may cause a future pan@@ demic .
a influenza pan@@ demic breaks out if a new tribe of the flu virus has to spread , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against people .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts contained in the vaccine known in the vaccine , and forming antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later in a position to form a touch with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus of this common mono@@ cl@@ onal antibody .
subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus was removed with the &quot; surface an@@ ic &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , det@@ ects the human body as a body @-@ foreign ) and is used as a component of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this gives the scope of the scope of the clinical data base to meet the assessment of vacc@@ ination of vacc@@ ination as well as to meet the requirements of the EMEA to pre@@ pan@@ demic vacc@@ ines .

it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are caused by the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for those who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase may not be taken as a solution , but it cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been examined .
A@@ gen@@ ase should then be instit@@ uted if the doctor has examined the an@@ tivir@@ al drugs of the patient previously , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood disc@@ ern@@ ed that the virus may be addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gen@@ ase reduces the people in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines in the blood and keep it at a low level .
AIDS does not cure diseases , however , the damage of the immune system and therefore does not hesitate to develop the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gen@@ ase was examined in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , however without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who were previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing .
this drug with low do@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced phar@@ maceuticals was compared with 206 adults who had taken earlier prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other proteins .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in blood ( vir@@ us@@ last ) or change of vir@@ al load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks in A@@ gen@@ ase , more patients had a vir@@ al load under 400 copies / ml than in placebo , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the vir@@ al load , however , with the children who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing , only very few for the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing , the vir@@ al load was the vir@@ al load as effective after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant against four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gen@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of vir@@ al load after four weeks as in the patients who continued their previous Prot@@ eas@@ ant .
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( mal@@ fall ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , skin r@@ ash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase should not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive against Am@@ b@@ av@@ ar@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase may also be used in patients receiving Johann@@ is@@ cab@@ bage ( a plant compound for the treatment of depression ) or medic@@ inal products , which are treated equally as A@@ gen@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in blood health .
how other drugs against HIV is in patients who take blood cells , the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ ore@@ tic syn@@ dro@@ mes ( symptoms of an infection which are caused by recovered Immun@@ e System ) .
the Gender Equality Committee reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs for the treatment of treated HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee established that the benefit of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not proven .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; extraordinary circumstances since the time of approval for scientific reasons only had limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the market launch of A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children from 4 years .
usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules to pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r can be taken together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r should be done considering the individual vir@@ al resistance measurement and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio availability of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis , not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg Am@@ fra@@ vi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhanced additive of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gen@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ ul@@ vi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ b@@ lown t@@ av@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing were not examined in children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data to the un@@ certainty and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data , the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules in adult patients with medium @-@ severe liver function was reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be patient with light or even liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also the substr@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ be@@ et 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal joints that contain Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) may not be applied because of the risk @-@ reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r during the intake of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be noted that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not result in a cure of HIV infection that they can continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections , or complic@@ ations of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including the treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase does not prevent the risk of a transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are treated with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , have an increased risk for severe liver problems with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneously an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the related information of this medic@@ inal product .
patients with pre @-@ existing restricted liver function including chronic hepatitis C shows an increased frequency of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ ca@@ oids , which are changed over CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , unless the possible benefits of a treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tik@@ ost@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the ad@@ ren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
because the fuel exchange of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors strongly depends on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended for increased risk of my@@ opath@@ y including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , ph@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Standards ratio ) , are methods to determine the concentration of active concentration .
in patients who take this medication at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma concentration of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ diction can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with am@@ big@@ u@@ r , the patient should therefore be monitored to o@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ an@@ them , especially if there are still low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of a tox@@ icity because of the high prop@@ yl @-@ fat content of the A@@ gen@@ ase , this formulation is con@@ ferred in children under an age of four years and should be used with some other patient groups .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be set on duration 5 if a r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , was reported about the occurr@@ ence of Diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or a result of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other ill@@ nesses that were necessary for their therapy to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical - dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing , there are reports about an increase of bleeding including spont@@ aneous mut@@ ans hem@@ at@@ ome and Hä@@ mar@@ thro@@ at .
with HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ def@@ ective patients , an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ atic reaction to as@@ ym@@ pt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ ist infections which leads to severe clinical trials or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial en@@ e@@ ology is believed ( including use of grain liver , alcohol consumption , heavy immune disease index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ros@@ is reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with a low therapeutic width of A@@ gen@@ ase may not simultaneously provide a small therapeutic width and also the substr@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ be@@ et 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 substr@@ ates with a low therapeutic width ap@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with drugs , the active substances used mainly via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , and are associated with serious plasma concentration and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance performance .
during the attempt , the lowest plasma concentration by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were observed very often un@@ desirable effects at the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) The serum levels of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r can be ab@@ ased by simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) .
if a patient receiving Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ us@@ av@@ irus are , and , if possible , check the vir@@ al load and add the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ vi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ b@@ av@@ r ( see also E@@ at ir@@ ence below ) .
508 % increase , for C@@ ups by 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ b@@ av@@ ed capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ b@@ av@@ r were used twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily to prove the efficacy and im@@ aging of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower if Am@@ b@@ av@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) were approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ b@@ av@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended for eng@@ aging , because the effectiveness and in@@ ability of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist study for the application of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gen@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore at the gift of E@@ lin@@ ir@@ ence in combination with Am@@ b@@ av@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ fra@@ c@@ ence in combination with Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both protein spl@@ end@@ or would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin based on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited information can be assumed that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin reduces the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
if this medication should be used simultaneously , be careful because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly a sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
when this product is applied together , be careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and rolog@@ ical monitoring is supposed to be difficult , as an exact predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of retinal gas concentrations ( AU@@ C ) resulted in a rise in the plasma concentration of 193 % and thus too an increase in Ri@@ fug@@ ut@@ in related side effects .
when it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ u@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gen@@ ase is recommended to achieve a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ gs in at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not performed , but the plasma concentration of both medic@@ inal products could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of 700 mg of fi@@ os@@ amp@@ ar@@ r , and 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in serum levels by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 4 ) to the value which was observed after 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day without simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub @-@ str@@ ate , Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied to inter@@ actions together with A@@ gen@@ ase , possibly inter@@ actions .
the patients should therefore be connected to toxic reactions , which are used with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , Ant@@ azi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption distur@@ b@@ ance .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ vul@@ si@@ va that are known as enzym@@ es ( phen@@ yl to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r can lead to a ab@@ ased the plasma spot of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r .
the serum concentration of calcium @-@ channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ pl@@ di@@ pin , n@@ du@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ ec@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 through am@@ b@@ lown vi@@ r , reducing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medication .
simultaneous intake of A@@ gen@@ ase , its plasma concentration can increase considerably and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination with p@@ ter@@ ist@@ rates , ten@@ sions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ ul@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ spl@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days increased to volunteers , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol grew about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ conv@@ ey interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gen@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glucose cor@@ rid@@ ors , unless the possible benefits of a treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tex @-@ ero@@ i@@ der effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a reduc@@ t@@ ase , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose fuel exchange is strongly dependent of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , increases increases of plasma concentration in simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase .
since plasma level increases this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors for my@@ opath@@ y including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , the combined use of this medic@@ inal product is not recommended .
there is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as recommended as stabil@@ ization of the mirror , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with simultaneous gift of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase should not be used together with oral @-@ recorded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while at the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase with par@@ l@@ ative Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r , the patient should therefore be monitored to o@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ an@@ them , especially if there are still low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of its low reliability of historical compar@@ isons you can currently be given no recommendation , such as the am@@ us@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose if Am@@ b@@ av@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on .
in case of simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , it is recommended for increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ diction is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended in simultaneous gift of A@@ gen@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful abol@@ ition of the possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk enabled rats , Am@@ b@@ av@@ r related materials have been proven , however , it is not known whether am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is over with breast milk .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the onset in the u@@ terus to the end of the nurs@@ ing time Am@@ b@@ av@@ r , showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight when post@@ pon@@ ed .
the further development of offspring including fertil@@ ity and reproduction was not imp@@ aired by administration of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r on matern@@ ity .
the Indi@@ ct@@ ability of A@@ gen@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years and studied clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
most of the effects related to the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment of side effects were slightly extended until moderate , occurred early and conducted sel@@ dom to treatment .
many of these events is not clari@@ fied whether they are related to HIV @-@ treatment or any other HIV @-@ treatment simultaneously , or whether they are a result of hor@@ s@@ under@@ age .
most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects were taken from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing did not received 1200 mg A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , noted by the investig@@ ator as associated with the study medication , were listed and present in more than 1 % of patients , as well under the treatment of respon@@ sive laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peripheral fat tissue , more intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al tissues , hyper@@ t@@ rophy of the breasts and dor@@ man@@ ne@@ at@@ al tissues .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not treated persons treated with Am@@ b@@ av@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in for a medium duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( bul@@ b@@ aked ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients were represented at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - previously treated patients under Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a median duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.001 ) .
sk@@ ill@@ nesses were normally pronounced as moderate to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ cul@@ op@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z and occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without the treatment with am@@ us@@ vi@@ r had to be demolished .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose , especially in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
with HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ def@@ ective patients , anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to as@@ ym@@ pt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily together with low dose of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed among women &apos;s glyc@@ eride and CP@@ I values , which received A@@ gen@@ ase , together with low dose of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently .
in case of an over@@ dosage the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are included .

the link between the activity of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of the HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not pre @-@ treated patients with currently permitted F@@ os@@ amp@@ ar@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed , as with other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - described in rare cases .

for gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance testing , Gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations can be applied to estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resistance than the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I / I , L@@ 33@@ A / C / W / W / C , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance on F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions as regards the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation template can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to attract the latest interpre@@ tations systems for analysis of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing analyses in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with an inclined sensitivity against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated genet@@ ics creates a certain clo@@ ister against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on the clo@@ ister between Am@@ b@@ av@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ing for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not pre @-@ treated patients ( one of them had a resistance to L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , Washing Ink 2 / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) .
in reverse , Am@@ b@@ av@@ r reserves the activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates ; upon receipt of this activity , the number and resistance of resistance mut@@ ations is dependent on the isol@@ ates .
early termination of an ag@@ gression therapy is recommended to keep up the accum@@ ulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in the borders which can result in the subsequent treatment .
the receipt of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a randomised trial , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ y ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; b@@ oo@@ st@@ ert , &quot; received .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty @-@ three ( s = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity versus the A@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis turned the non @-@ sub @-@ security of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in terms of time @-@ adjusted average reduction of the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ underwater wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ born A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase provides solution to intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of those treated with PI had previously treated at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) together with A@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients in the study included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in an median increase of CD@@ 4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered as anticipated benefit with PI &apos;s children who are expected to be considered an unexpected benefit of &quot; un@@ used &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increases , for C@@ ups by 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered along with am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
administration of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on concentration of ampl@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) remains un@@ affected by the food intake although the con@@ current food intake influences the magn@@ itude and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approx . 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an unexpected penetration of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r from blood circulation in the tissue .
this amendment leads to a decrease in the total concentration of active ingredients in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ b@@ av@@ r that remains the active part , probably unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ b@@ av@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents during the dosing intervals in the Ste@@ ady state concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s .
therefore , medic@@ inal product , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or in@@ hib@@ itions or in@@ hib@@ itions or respectively , must be given to be given at the same time when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg times daily , leads to a similar daily ambul@@ b@@ ular exposure such as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ b@@ av@@ r is from the solution 14 % less flexible than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase Solution and A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a million@@ basis .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al function is likely to reduce the elim@@ ination of am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ es lead to Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ es which is comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity of mice and rats occurred among male animals ren@@ ig@@ ne h@@ epat@@ oma cells in dos@@ ages that followed the 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice a daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ b@@ lown .
the 21 under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ h@@ epat@@ oma cells and car@@ cin@@ oma were not yet resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
from the present assessment data on humans , both of clinical studies as well as from therapeutic application , however , some evidence for accept@@ ing a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro diagnostic tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro @-@ core tests on human peripheral l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes included , was Am@@ b@@ av@@ irus nor presum@@ ed toxic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven in clinical use by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far in clinical trials any significant liver tox@@ icity was observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gen@@ ase even after the treatment of therapy .
studies for tox@@ icity in young animals , which were treated from 4 days at the age of 4 , showed a high mortality in both the control and with am@@ b@@ av@@ ed animals .
however , at a system@@ ic plasma exposition the significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) was observed , however , a number of minor changes including th@@ ym@@ us@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhanced additive of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ kings ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ ul@@ vi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ b@@ lown t@@ av@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be observed in patients with weak or light liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , ph@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Standards ratio ) , are methods to determine the concentration of active concentration .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be set on duration 27 if a r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with pharmaceutical - dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance performance .
508 % increase , for C@@ ups by 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ b@@ av@@ ed capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) were approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ b@@ av@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended for eng@@ aging , because the effectiveness and in@@ ability of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ fra@@ c@@ ence in combination with Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both protein spl@@ end@@ or would be low .
when this product is applied together , be careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and rolog@@ ical monitoring is supposed to be difficult , as an exact predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
when it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ u@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gen@@ ase is recommended to achieve a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ gs in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data .

in a clinical study , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ ul@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ spl@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days increased to volunteers , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol grew about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ conv@@ ey interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in case of simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , it is recommended for increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ thin@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ b@@ av@@ r by 22 %
this drug may only be used during pregnancy only after careful abol@@ ition of the possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , of which was administered by the ni@@ p@@ ation in the u@@ terus to the end of the nurs@@ ing time Am@@ b@@ av@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the body weight when post@@ pon@@ ed .
the Indi@@ ct@@ ability of A@@ gen@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years and studied clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
in case of an over@@ dosage the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are included .
an an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was diagnosed in both acute and chronic l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes tissue lines ( MT @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.08 µ@@ M in acute cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µg / ml ) .
in reverse , Am@@ b@@ av@@ r reserves the activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates ; upon receipt of this activity , the number and resistance of resistance mut@@ ations is dependent on the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the therap@@ ies with PI advanced children should be considered as expected for the unexpected benefit of &quot; un@@ used &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ b@@ av@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents during the dosing intervals in the Ste@@ ady state concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s ..
therefore , medic@@ inal product , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or in@@ hib@@ itions or in@@ hib@@ itions or respectively , must be given to be given at the same time when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al function is likely to be low on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the benefit of using R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ner &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase Solution was not included in PI previously treated patients with PI previously treated patients .
the bio availability of Am@@ b@@ av@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis , not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be taken once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to un@@ plug ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase Solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ b@@ av@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2800 mg Am@@ b@@ av@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase solution to intake and low @-@ sensitivity R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided by this combination .
although a dose adjustment for Am@@ b@@ av@@ r is not necessary for an application of A@@ gen@@ ase , a application of A@@ gen@@ ase is contra@@ cted in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl@@ fat content , A@@ gen@@ ase solution is a solution for infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver problems and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can lead to a competent shirt of the metabolism of this drug and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects such as cardiovascular problems ( z .
the patients should be noted that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to cure HIV infection that they also develop in opportun@@ ist infections , or complic@@ ations of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including the treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase does not prevent the risk of dying from HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .

after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the les@@ ions were not completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
when a dose has been left , the patient must wear the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapeutic plan .
in a thin layer , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is absorbed in a thin layer and st@@ oned with a stran@@ t in@@ ted skin area until the cream is completely coated .
there should be a abstra@@ ction in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and associated with a possible dis@@ card of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a abstra@@ ction in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the associated organ or Gra@@ des @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .
in other studies where no daily Vor@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene were performed , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis was observed and a case with a pr@@ un@@ ing of leading stro@@ kes were observed .
in a application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses an increased risk for severe skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , causes severe skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , a treatment is necessary and / or caused by a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reaction responses were applied to the outcome of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulties when leaving the body , which required a emergency customs clearance and a treatment of the affected area .
for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly in connection to treatment with other cut@@ aneous accounts for the treatment of external F@@ eig@@ h in the genital and periods there are no clinical experiences yet .
limited data suggest an increased rate of gra@@ dients among HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown in this patient group in relation to eliminate F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces but a lower efficacy .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or hair set was not examined .
local reaction actions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or the sever@@ ity of local su@@ pers@@ ist actions , a treatment period of several days may be made .
according to the re@@ generation of the treated skin , the clinical outcome can be judged by the end of treatment approximately 12 weeks after treatment .
since there are currently no data about long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months of treatment , should be combined with super@@ fi@@ brill@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma other appropriate therap@@ ies .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s are no clinical experience , therefore the application of previously treated tum@@ ors are not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7,@@ 25 cm2 ) a lower lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of the response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy consists of .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or in the lip @-@ range within the lip of light .
there are only very limited information about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants on anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis in the lower and hands support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such a such application is not recommended .
local skin reaction occur frequently , but these reactions usually take effect in the course of the therapy of intensity or going back after the dis@@ advantage of the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if the local skin reaction changes the patient &apos;s large dis@@ comfort or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days .
out of the data from an open clinical study reports that patients with more than 8 nu@@ is@@ sions have a lower total healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stim@@ ulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od should be used with caution in patients who received immun@@ os@@ mut@@ ation treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies no direct or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ t@@ ale development , re@@ bound or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although it has not been reached after one time after several more top@@ ographic application ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , there may be no recommendation for use during the breast@@ feeding period .
most of the most commonly shared and possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions to the place of treatment of F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( 3@@ 3.7 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
the most frequently reported and possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects include Complaints on the application area with a frequency of 28,@@ 1 % .
the study of 185 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of the Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with the related adverse events were a reaction on the application location ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
side effects associated by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
this according to the investig@@ ative evaluation of the clinical evidence shows that it frequently came in this placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently due to local skin reaction including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , corrosion / abor@@ ators ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) and oil ( see section 4.4 ) .
this according to the investig@@ ative evaluation of the clinical evidence shows that it is very frequently used in those trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream ( 31 % ) , heavy cru@@ ises ( 13 % ) , heavy ra@@ ch@@ ement and sal@@ aries ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was detected with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment place or in the ambient area .
the unique combination of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags may result in nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
clin@@ ically severe adverse events that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alised themselves according to oral or intraven@@ ous liquid .
a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic investigation have been demonstrated after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od of the Alp@@ ha@@ inter@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that the effectiveness in relation to a complete recovery of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ od treatment is significantly superior over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .
in 60 % of the patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients experienced the sever@@ ity of patients alive ; this was 20 % of the 105 treated with placebo in the case of placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved in 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared with 5 % of 161 treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five time application a week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tumor were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super fever cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 with a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open @-@ controlled study study showed that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of is@@ o@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three weeks of regular use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , untreated clinical trials , has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ tension nu@@ is@@ sions within one @-@ related 25 cm2 of large treatment plants on the un@@ hair@@ y scal@@ p or on the face .
the bi@@ ennium data from two combined observation studies indicate a recur@@ rent retinal vas@@ cul@@ mination of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indicator of external cases , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super fi@@ bre@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma occurs normally in a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients usually and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four randomised , double @-@ blind studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , placebo n = 313 ) .
in these studies the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not shown in these studies where dosing are not shown ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks
a minimum systematic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest pharmaceutical concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and totalled 0,1 , 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 single bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / poor ( 75 mg , 6 bag ) .
the calculated value @-@ time was about 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of a previous study ; pointing to a prolonged retreat of the phar@@ maceuticals in the skin .
data on the system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low according to top@@ ical application of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years , and similar to healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study for the derm@@ ic tox@@ icity at the rat no . doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly lower weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; a result of a result of four months showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice at three days per week induced no tum@@ ors at the point of use .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small system@@ ic absorption from human skin and not mut@@ agen@@ ic , is a risk for man due to the system@@ ic exposure as very low .
the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice that was treated with the real @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger number than in the control group with low u@@ VR .
it can harm other people even if these same symptoms have seen as you . − If any of the listed side effects you are considerably imp@@ aired , or you don &apos;t notice any side effects , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ies .

the study was mainly examined the safety of the medicine , however , its effectiveness was measured by its effectiveness in relation to the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in ur@@ ine and in relation to the size of the liver .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me acquired the G@@ AG concentrations in ur@@ ine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) , head@@ ache , oste@@ o@@ ath@@ y ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the infusion place .
frequent side effects in patients under five years of increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen saturation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sh@@ aken frost .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react sensiti@@ vely to patients ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction ) .
each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every year , to verify all new information , which may be updated whenever necessary .
the manufacturer of al@@ en@@ az@@ y@@ me is treated patients who observe al@@ en@@ az@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to infusion and development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ enzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the placing on the market from Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology under the use of Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ oth cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ WS , E@@ ier@@ stock of Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is inde@@ xed to patients with proven diagnosis of a Mu@@ ti@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ de outlet I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
the initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient is responsible for a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended .
safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency has not been determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended .
with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ treated patients can develop inf@@ usions , which are defined as every side effects , which occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients also should remain monitored continuously , and the infusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be provided within a reasonable clinical environment in the recovery equipment for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies are forming against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an inf@@ usions , must be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer break is concerned , due to the theoretical increased risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction after a inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of the infusion with medic@@ ations ( Anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti @-@ py@@ rol@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of inf@@ usions .
in case of a light or intermediate @-@ infusion reaction , the treatment with anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ines and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be used and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to the half of the infusion rate where the reaction is occurred .
in case of a single , severe inf@@ usions reaction , the infusion has to be stopped , the symptoms have to decline to decline , a treatment with anti @-@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
infusion rate can be resum@@ ed on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate , where the infusion is to be resum@@ ed .
3 ( Anti@@ hist@@ amin@@ ika and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usions .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal experiments on direct or indirect harmful effects to the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data placed in new@@ bor@@ ns , exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , is recommended to do not satisfy during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse reactions in clinical trials were classified mainly as inf@@ usions , which in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients were observed in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
un@@ desirable medication actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension to a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older are often specified in the following table : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some cases with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related involvement in the upper respiratory trac@@ ts and lungs beside the previous history , severe reactions were seen , including Bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ y , breathing and fac@@ ial ton@@ ers ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted medicines related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me associated with a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly heavy blow @-@ form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients there occurred within 3 months after the treatment to a ser@@ op@@ o@@ con@@ version , whereby it came to the patient at the age of 5 with a severe decrease in times ( on average after 26 days over 45 days with patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature evaluation from the study ) were detected in 13 / 45 patients by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ en@@ cip@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , among them 3 patients where it has never been come to ser@@ op@@ t @-@ version .
patients with a lack of low distortion mirror was a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , while in patients with high antibody tit@@ res , a variable reduction of G@@ AG was observed in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed an mar@@ g@@ inal effects of a mar@@ g@@ inal effect to the enzym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vitro , which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to stand in connection with the incidence of un@@ wanted medicines , even if the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted medicines are typically taken together with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the grounds for the drug therapy is in one for the Hydro@@ ly@@ se of the cum@@ ulative substr@@ ate and the preventing a further accum@@ ulation of sufficient recovery .
after an intraven@@ ous infusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly taken out of the circulation and cells in the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely to have Mann@@ osis 6 phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the entire disease range was , the majority of the patients had the mean phenom@@ ena and only one patient demonstrated the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited , if they had an ongoing exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the mean FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients were treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients compared to placebo group an improvement of lung function and the ability to occur in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining that effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and a number of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease of the percentage of FE@@ V is not significant in this period of clinical and absolute lung @-@ volumes increased over propor@@ tion@@ ately propor@@ tion@@ ate children .
out of 26 patients with H@@ ep@@ nuclear anom@@ ali@@ es 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a considerable decline of G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µg / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was found that remained constant until the end of the study .
as regards the h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients who summar@@ ize significant changes in five efficacy of normal subjects ( mean age range in 6 minutes ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a single year @-@ old open phase 2 study was carried out in which primarily the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was studied at 20 patients , which at the time of their recording to the study was under 5 years old ( 16 patients with a heavy duty shape and 4 with middle course form ) .
in four patients the dosing was increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 .
in several patients a size of magn@@ itude ( n = 7 ) and one weight gain ( n = 3 ) was found according to the Z @-@ score for those aged form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with mean delay form , whereas in the older patients with severe depression and no progress in cogn@@ itive development were observed .
research @-@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schem@@ es were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent in patients who have trouble with weekly inf@@ usions , however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schem@@ es is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will provide any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drugs will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those affected by older and fewer patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is applied along with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another drugs against cancer ) in patients receiving chemotherapy alone ( by an operation alone cannot be removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ity ) - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body . • Advanced or metastatic &quot; non@@ small cell lung cancer , who doesn &apos;t attack the plate epithel@@ ium cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated previously , in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who had previously applied other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , and had previously applied for any therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( vitamin B6 ) should be obtained and inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , it should additionally be given an &quot; Anti@@ emet@@ ry &quot; ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed in its active form goes lighter than in healthy cells than in healthy cells , which results in higher concentrations in the active form of the phar@@ maceuticals and a longer term of cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in one main study of 456 patients for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ jk , who had previously had no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study enrolled 5@@ 71 patients with local experienced or metastatic disease which had previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further product against cancer ) , and in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , aver@@ aged 12,@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months in the single administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously treated chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies however , patients where cancer does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells when applying A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the calculation .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. a approval for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each bottle of water must be dissolved using 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary wick is taken from filling and diluted with 0,9 % sodium chloride injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml . ( see Section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell car@@ cin@@ oma except for superior re@@ epithel@@ ial re@@ epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .

the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body @-@ surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an infusion in a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after P@@ emet@@ eries - infusion in the first day of every 21 days treatment course .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous bronze @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma following a period of 10 minutes for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
reduction of the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reaction must be given a day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ r@@ ost@@ ero@@ id .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and taking it during the entire period of therapy as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ ry rate .
patients must also receive a in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third movement cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift , including the differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ wel .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose survey must take place under consideration of the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the pre@@ heated therapy cycles .
after the recovery , the patients must be treated according to the tables in Figures 1 , 2 and 3 that are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mono@@ therap@@ ies or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
patients don &apos;t develop cancer @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degree 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the patient must treat the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient must pay the value before the treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when patients after 2 dose conduc@@ tive tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the appearance of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies did not notice that in patients at the age of 65 years or compared to patients aged 65 years an elevated minor risk is an increase .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of non @-@ sufficient data for the un@@ certainty and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , there were no dose adjustment in patients with a cancer @-@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which is suggested for all patients recommended dose adjustments .
the data base in patients with a cancer @-@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limitation of &gt; the 1.5 times the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; to the 3.0 times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( near liver metast@@ ases ) was not especially examined in studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the bone - mark@@ er and P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must not be administered to patients before the absolute Neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic value has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the flow rate has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose of dose for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ hel@@ ical numbers , thro@@ at number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous therapy cycles - see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ology and ni@@ ch@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity such as Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia had taken care when a pre@@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed patients must be referred to folic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ y@@ - l@@ act@@ ate measure for reduction @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( cancer @-@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) , the simultaneous non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of treatment and minimum treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended for a treatment with P@@ emet@@ ye@@ asts must be avoided by taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients where these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ screening , hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid - collection of a trans@@ cellular room a dra@@ ining of the eff@@ lu@@ de before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment will be explained .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were often reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , when this drug was administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated se@@ dim@@ esi@@ ve ( except yellow fever , this in@@ oc@@ ulation is contra@@ cted ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
because the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage caused by P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be noted before the treatment - g@@ inn insi@@ sts on the lock enhancement .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( C@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed clari@@ fication by a result of an increasingly rising effects of side effects .
therefore , be careful when patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cra@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) provides high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and minimum , 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ ye@@ are avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data about the interaction potential with a long half life as Pi@@ ro@@ x x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - are avoided .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of t@@ inn@@ s status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ ye@@ asts in pregnant women , but as an@@ abolic anti@@ metabol@@ ites are expected to occur in pregnancy in pregnancy .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must not be applied during pregnancy , except it is necessary and after careful depreciation of the user for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to the re@@ productive capacity caused by P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment course , advice regarding the sperm con@@ vi@@ ve confusion .
it is not known if P@@ emet@@ re@@ ty goes over to the mother &apos;s milk and un@@ wanted effects in the des@@ ill@@ ary inf@@ ant can not be excluded .

it is applied with over@@ sized adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low cal@@ orie @-@ poor , low @-@ induced diet .
patients who are taking all@@ i and can assume no weight loss after 12 weeks , should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ies .
these enzym@@ es are in@@ hib@@ ited , they can not eradi@@ c@@ ate some fats in the diet , causing a quarter of food @-@ guided fats .
in a third trial all@@ i was compared with 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
in both studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who were 60 mg in total , after one year , had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 there was no significant difference for patients of relevant weight loss .
the most common adverse events of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , Fl@@ atus ( winch ) with stu@@ ff@@ ness , hat@@ eful / o@@ ily chair , sec@@ ular secre@@ tion ( f@@ ooth@@ ness ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing the transplan@@ tation on gra@@ ft reactions ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from long @-@ term mal@@ ign@@ es ( with which not sufficient nutrients from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to cholesterol ( a liver disease ) , and pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the placing on the market of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ory , low @-@ induced diet .
all@@ i cannot be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there are not enough data to be efficacy and safety .
however or@@ list@@ at is only minimal fast@@ ener , is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of the dosage necessary .
• Over@@ all active ingredient , or one of other components • Premature treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • chronic mal@@ absorption syndrome • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Comp@@ ens@@ ing treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurr@@ ence of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat single meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction of diabetes with improved met@@ abolic control should take patient to consult a medicine against diabetes , before the onset of therapy with all@@ i must consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dosage of anti @-@ diabet@@ ic treatments should be adapted .
patients who possess all drugs as well as drugs against high blood cholesterol , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ies if the dosage of this medicine must be adapted .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating matern@@ ity measures in order to prevent severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea possible failure of the oral contra@@ diction ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a decrease of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ine plasma concentration .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) .
most patients who have been treated with or@@ list@@ at up to 4 full years , remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ carot@@ ene in the norm range .
however , the patients should be recommended , before bed@@ time a supplem@@ entary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient Vit@@ amine absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) .
following a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a reduced number of volunteers at the same time , or@@ list@@ at received a minor decrease of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experiments shown no direct or indirect effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effect of the phar@@ maceuticals , as the absorption of recorded fat is avoided .
the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the number of cabins are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
the prevalence of adverse events that were detected after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at were not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of certain size .
† There is pl@@ au@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day have been administered over a period of 15 days with normal and overweight patients without a significant clinical outcome .
in the majority of the reported cases of or@@ list@@ at @-@ over @-@ do@@ dis@@ ation , either no side effects or similar effects were reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on humans and animal it can be assumed by a rapid response of any system@@ ic effects , which are due to li@@ list@@ at the properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect places the l@@ umen of stomach and the upper @-@ int@@ estine through the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic fl@@ pas@@ en .
clinical trials was derived from 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 , prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ ory , fat @-@ induced diet .
the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been rated as follows : as a percentage of the body weight in the study course ( Table 1 ) and as proportion of those who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output value ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss during the first 6 months was observed .
the average change in the total cholesterol amounted to 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value : 5,@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value : 5,@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value of 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( initial value of 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .
in the wa@@ ist circumference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting at 10@@ 3,7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( base value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abolic or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ ur@@ able 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .

this means that the active ingredient preventing a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , by recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemicals therap@@ ies , which are strong and moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are , 59 % of the patients who have been treated with alo@@ es in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 by 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
during chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are , 81 % of the patients who were treated with alo@@ es in the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy alone ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the placing on the market of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : prevention of acute mal@@ ine and vom@@ iting for strong chemotherapy due to cancer disease and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting for moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced through a highly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on passage , patients with am@@ nesty or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , be careful with the simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or by patient where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or which tend to be an extension .
except in connection with a further chemical therapeu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi in the days after chemotherapy was neither used for prevention nor to treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made up against tum@@ ours of the five investigated chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics not ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ ak@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration of Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , of a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one population based pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis showed that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , par@@ tr@@ al@@ in , ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the cle@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not before , therefore the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women , unless it is necessary by the previously treated doctor .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , who were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and fruit ip@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity actions and reactions to the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar Frequ@@ encies of adverse events showed un@@ wanted events such as in other dosing groups ; there were no dose of action @-@ relationships .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably does not have an effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 intraven@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mcg / m2 intraven@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mcg / m2 intraven@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mcg / m2 intraven@@ ous ( half @-@ time 7,3 hours ) , given that day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ ron was given intraven@@ ous .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 667 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of palm oil received with patients who received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron that was given to day 1 intraven@@ ous .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study responded to the following tables in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was similar to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the respective effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron .
following the findings of clinical research , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the formation of the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ formation and repe@@ ating the duration of the shareholder .
the aim of the survey carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of I.@@ V. in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg in single doses .
Res@@ or@@ ption According to intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease of Plas@@ ma@@ concentr@@ ates a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average terminal time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately in the total dose range of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in patients and cancer patients .
according to the intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured in 11 ho@@ k car@@ cin@@ oma patients between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ sts at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic sim@@ ulations , that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration from 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days , total exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to a time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was 0.75 mg higher after the one time .
about 40 % are elim@@ in@@ ates with the kidneys , and some 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic cases , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro clinical trials for met@@ abolic symptoms have demonstrated that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination of an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose have been found in ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made up about 40 % of the given dose .
according to a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection of patients , the total body weight amounted to 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver function , the terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al time and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of dose is however not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate over the maximum of human@@ ist exposure , which indicates a small relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 From pre@@ clinical studies indicate that palm oil can block only in very high concentrations of ion@@ ing channels , which are involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ formation and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose induced in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , who were given daily over two years , resulted in an increasingly incidence of liver tum@@ ors , en@@ doc@@ rine Ne@@ op@@ las@@ men ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , an@@ ni@@ er@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors with rats , but not with mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not completely unknown , but due to the used high doses and da Alo@@ xi at a time for one @-@ time application , the relev@@ ance of these results will be assessed as one for humans .
the holder of this approval for placing on the market has to inform the European Commission on the placing on the placing on the market in the context of this decision .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the pro@@ hibit@@ ing of the authorisation for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection @-@ solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon should be similar to any biological medicine called Ro@@ feron @-@ A with the same practice as an effective component which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference Medic@@ ations &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a long @-@ lasting liver disease ) .
the liver tissue damage caused by micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation also shows the values of the liver Al@@ an@@ in@@ - amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood .
it is produced by an yeast which resulted in a gene expression ( DNA ) which is attached to the formation of the active ingredients .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon &#91; sic &#93; data presented to the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( active structure , composition , and clarity of drugs , efficiency , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared to 455 patients with the effectiveness of the reference rate .
in the study , as many patients after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of the treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus is applied to the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document , Author@@ ised for non business , only asked the importance that CH@@ MP grants the recommendation for placing on the market .
in addition , concerns are noted , that data on the stability of the active and market product are not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C aff@@ ecting the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ feron @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease was infl@@ amed with more patients than at the reference point ; in addition , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the study used in the study was to evaluate the medicine a immune response ( i.e. the body creates antibodies - special proteins - against the phar@@ maceuticals ) , not suff@@ iciently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pet@@ igo ( one with cruci@@ fixes for continuous skin infection ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or or ker@@ os@@ hen ) , de@@ fle@@ es and intact wounds .
Alt@@ ar@@ go is intended to be used for the treatment of infections , which were det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because bur@@ go against this type of infections may not work .
Alt@@ ar@@ go can be applied in patients with the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface must not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment within two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient and consider alternative treatments in consideration .
it affects the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was rejected by the end of treatment .
119 patients ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under@@ ne@@ ath Alt@@ ar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of the 71 patients under@@ ne@@ ath the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Alt@@ ar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin dies , about 90 % of patients were treated with both groups .
however , in these two studies , however , Alt@@ ar@@ go was detected in the treatment of wast@@ ew@@ ays ( failed cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or of infections , which were det@@ ectable , or probably caused by M@@ RSA .
the most frequent tri@@ but@@ ary effect with alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 from 100 patients ) is a matur@@ ation at the contrac@@ tor .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Alt@@ ar@@ go during short @-@ time treatment of the following su@@ perf@@ icial skin infections , compared to the risks : • Im@@ pet@@ igo , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ations , break@@ through@@ s or se@@ wn wounds .
the European Commission issued Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the market launch of Alt@@ ar@@ go into the entire European Union in May 2007 .
the patients , which shows no improvement within two to three days , should be considered adequate , and an alternative therapy are considered to be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ ization or a heavy attack by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is canc@@ eled , the oint@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is supposed to be applied for the treatment of infections , where M@@ RSA is known as a path@@ ogen , is assumed ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary wounds caused the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections which were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant forkli@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , was in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered as a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvements or deteri@@ oration of the infected place .
the effect of simultaneous application of retri@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means of the same skin surface has not been examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentration , which have been achieved by people after top@@ ical application , or infected with su@@ perf@@ icial manner in vivo , a clin@@ ically relevant shirts in vivo can not be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 . after the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the medium retin@@ ot@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be applied to the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic exposure according to top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not necessary , when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction elast@@ icity after oral care and are in@@ sufficient for reference to impact on the birth and the red@@ dish / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
in pregnancy Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a system@@ ic anti@@ bi@@ otic to avoid .
the decision on whether the breast@@ feeding continued / terminated or the therapy with Alt@@ ar@@ go continued / finish , is between the benefit of the nurs@@ ing for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Alt@@ ar@@ go therapy to the woman .
in clinical trials in 2@@ 150 patients with su@@ perf@@ icial skin infections , the Alt@@ ar@@ go had applied , the most frequently reported an@@ rit@@ ation in the passage that affects approximately 1 % of the patients .
action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ in , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis due to a specific binding point of the 50s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , distingu@@ ishes itself from the binding positions of other ri@@ bos@@ om anti@@ bacterial substances .
data suggest that the Ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ ary centre and the Pep@@ tide @-@ transfer@@ able Center .
due to binding at this binding point , P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ ine to block the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transferred , are blocking partly P @-@ binder inter@@ actions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
due to the local prevalence of resistance the resistance of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some infection forms , an advice should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity from Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , ir@@ respective of whether the ins@@ ulator were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to treat the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ant factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ val@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was applied 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion and placed on sh@@ ielded skin for up to 7 days .
of 516 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary wounds , individual plasma proteins were obtained .
the rehear@@ sal was performed on days 3 or 4 during adult patients in front of the medi@@ ation and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system for people after top@@ ical application of 1 % Sal@@ be applied to 200 cm2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP shirts .
Met@@ abol@@ ism in vitro oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic syndrome in human liver mic@@ ros@@ omes became mainly convey@@ ed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under small participation of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in vitro investigation on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , or in cultures of human blood l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in @-@ vivo test chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither by male nor female fertil@@ ity associated with reduced doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which reaches up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest possible exposure in human beings ( top@@ ical application on 200 cm2 ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ iz@@ a study of rats were ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development fixing ( reduced body weight ) and matern@@ al tox@@ icity .
the holder of permission for placing on the market is necessary to present a pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ ree system , as in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is present and works before the product is mark@@ eted and as long as the product is applied .
the holder of approval for placing on the market is obliged to perform more detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ ree activities , as described in Version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of R@@ MP which will be agreed with CH@@ MP .

Ambi@@ rix will be used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) for children aged between one and 15 years that have not been immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied as part of two doses existing vacc@@ ines , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may not be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ isation has a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that it can be led out of two doses existing vacc@@ ination .
if a cancellation dose against hepatitis A or B is required , Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural body of the body ) , &quot; as it can defend against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens than a &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the new vaccine Twin@@ rix adult and the new vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect against the same diseases , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given as part of three doses existing vacc@@ ines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data covering the application of Twin@@ rix adults are also used as a letter for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of a protective antibodies .
in an additional study of 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine is compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led me from 98 to 100 % of im@@ min@@ ated children one month after the last injection of the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar at a 6 - and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ination boxes ) are head@@ aches , App@@ et@@ it@@ deficiency , pain due to injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ ri@@ ment ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not react to the active substances that may not react to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals . a permit for the placing on the market of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standard dim@@ entation plan for the lay@@ outs with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the appointment of the election , and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a guide is w@@ alled for Hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination .
the anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis C anti @-@ hepatitis ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as according to vacc@@ ination with the particular mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ants .
it is not fully assured whether immun@@ ity competent individuals who have addressed to a Hepatitis A@@ - Im@@ vaccine will need to be protected as a protection because they may also be protected in no more det@@ ectable antibodies due to the immune memory .
3 . as with all injection practices , one an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction should be immediately available in accordance with the gift of the vaccine treatment that will always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the flo@@ b@@ di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ema is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
using hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies resulting in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be required .
because intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimum success towards a sub@@ optimum success , the injection paths should be avoided .
however , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood cl@@ ine distur@@ b@@ ance , as it can be inj@@ ected in these cases after in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ ent gift .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the form of a separate inj@@ ections at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ an@@ us , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus influenza type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immune depression or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that potentially adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ination units of this formulation , the frequency of pain , tube , sw@@ elling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache and fever comparable with the frequency of vacc@@ ination and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ ination .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses are accompanied by a total of 10@@ 27 Imp@@ air@@ ings at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans match combination .
the only exceptions were the higher ranges of pain and mat@@ ri@@ dity on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination ambient Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix was given , about pain , compared with 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination .
the incidence of Mat@@ s was similar high ( i.e. above the total vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9,6 % of subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received the 3 @-@ cans combine material ) .
the frequency increased pain and mat@@ ri@@ dity was low and comparable to the combination of the combination of combination with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme was observed .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year Imp@@ aired , the occurr@@ ence of local re@@ actions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ent group compar@@ es with the 3 @-@ cans match combination with 360 ELISA units formed in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of combin@@ ant Hepatitis B Surface an@@ tigen .
however after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , was not per subject .
the proportion of Imp@@ aired on severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ination using Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses @-@ vacc@@ ination with the combination im@@ ply Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B , was statistically not different .
in clinical trials that were carried out at Imp@@ air@@ ingen in the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the ser@@ op@@ o@@ con@@ sion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % had a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 , administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ op@@ o@@ con@@ sion rates for Anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 , administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study that was carried out in 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ati@@ fication with three doses .
in the 289 people , whose immun@@ ity was evaluated , the tit@@ op@@ rot@@ ates rates ( SP in table below ) was significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 , according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose elements significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response in a clinical study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds were reported one month after the completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the Imp@@ air@@ ings received either a 2 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ines with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine , with 360 ELISA units formed in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B Surface an@@ tigen .
for people who were at the time of the footprint between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies were detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ o@@ deficiency observed in this study was comparable to the anti @-@ vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination sim@@ ulations , consisting of 360 ELISA units formed in@@ activated h@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies is comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ines which is equivalent to 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ines .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was taken in the second year of life with the help of a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ an@@ us , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus influenza type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 cans of the present formulation of adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ations and ser@@ op@@ o@@ con@@ sion rates as for former formulation .
the vaccine is available both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ alties at any external particles and / or physical visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transferred by vir@@ al food@@ stuffs and beverages , but can also be transferred by other ways such as through Baden in water poll@@ uted waters .
you can feel very tired , a dark white in , a bl@@ az@@ oned face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow ) and other symptoms that possibly make a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not protect fully from infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you are inf@@ ant / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ ines you are already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child can &apos;t feel un@@ likely or sick / feel ) a vacc@@ ination may not be avoided .
a protection against other infections which may harm the liver or symptoms which are similar to those after a hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• If your child already has an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can express yourself with ju@@ icy skin , breathing need or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • If you have occurred one allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the administration of the second vaccine dose ) .
with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will give you your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend using your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced level of effective components per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a formal in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a recur@@ ve Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced salary in effective stock is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give to your child a vacc@@ ination protection at the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from those who suffer from heavy blood cl@@ ine distur@@ b@@ ance to the skin and not in the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a disease or a treatment in your physical immune defence / or if you / your child will undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis / child .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in those cases , but the immune response of those persons on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong the response to vacc@@ ination is required .
21 Tell your physician , if you receive / your child any additional drugs , or if you have been vacc@@ inated without de@@ formation , or if you have been given / your child before have been given / or Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ bies ( antibodies ) have been given / or this is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient , and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B virus .
if another vaccine will be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as possible different lim@@ bs .
if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after a injection of Imm@@ un@@ lob@@ bies , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
normally , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women is not administered , but it is ur@@ gently required that it can be vacc@@ inated against Hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B .
important Information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please provide your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) once upon you / your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination you will talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has been announced since the opening of the first authorization for the placing on the market , CH@@ MP grants the opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix is positive .
however , since May 2003 , Ambi@@ rix was only placed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited to the small patient exposure .
ammon@@ aps may also be used in patients at the age of over one month with in@@ competent en@@ def@@ ective , or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium trans@@ missible spongiform encephalopath@@ y .
ammon@@ ite is administered - divided into several single doses among meals - swal@@ lowed under the diet or through a gast@@ ric acid ( by abdom@@ inal ceiling in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ probe ( through the nose in the gast@@ ric hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , because Ammon@@ aps could not be compared to another treatment or placebo ( investig@@ ational medicine , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ aps may also lead to appet@@ ite , a abnormal acidity level in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , pot@@ ence , irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , skin surface or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ aps prevent patients with interference from the ur@@ inary cycle to high pressures .
ammon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances because of the rarity from the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug .
the use is indicated in all patients where a full end deficiency might have been manifested in new bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ scale form ( in@@ completely en@@ ary def@@ ective , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself according to the first life of the months ) , there is an indication for the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese consist of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with sw@@ elling distur@@ b@@ ance , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated with regard to the protein tolerance and the development required daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose So@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 @-@ 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and with both adults and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosphate or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ ys@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is necessary in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ c@@ yn@@ a@@ yn@@ thetic lack must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces as a risk for the emergence of ec@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately .
every tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium sever@@ ity and econom@@ ising of incoming clinical trials should only be used with caution .
given Met@@ abol@@ ism and separation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ o@@ ate of young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal thick@@ ening and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional ner@@ ve cells in the brain and thus ensures a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be noted whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in breast milk , and this is the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the breast@@ feeding period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one desired event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they did not stand with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ rec@@ tom@@ y patient in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ ia , severe mort@@ cal@@ orie , peripheral Neurop@@ ath@@ y , peripheral Neurop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old small @-@ child with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ o@@ ate , which showed an intraven@@ ous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ si@@ fied neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ulate is a met@@ abolic active compound , con@@ jug@@ ate with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is di@@ vor@@ ced through the kidneys .
hi@@ de@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen phenol acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both coupl@@ ings contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for de@@ position of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ ine cycle can be assumed that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0,12 and 0.15 g of acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine nitrogen are produced for each gram .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early pre@@ mat@@ urely and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early symptoms of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was nearly always inf@@ ill , and the disease lead himself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their silent analogue analog@@ y within the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , util@@ isation of alternative way to nitrogen oxide ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ) , protein and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase the survival rate of neu@@ rop@@ ath in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life @-@ month ) diagnosed cases to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy were the survival rate of 100 % , but even in these patients the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients with many for mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
patients with a delayed form of the disease ( including female patients with h@@ etero@@ zy@@ got@@ es form of or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly trans@@ missible bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated permanently with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some cases , a further deteri@@ oration of the neu@@ rolo@@ gic conditions may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat oxi@@ des to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ o@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enzym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , using phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat for so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after single and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabolism was also examined in cancer patients following i@@ v gift of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ulate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tra@@ ys form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ ine cycles or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ sters , after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate in plasma was det@@ ectable in plasma .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day of oral in three single boxes ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate con@@ cent@@ ric concentrations were five times higher than after the first gifts .
separation The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine over the kidneys .
after the results of the mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses of treated rats no cl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either by mouth ( infants and infants that can not swal@@ low tablets , or patients with s@@ cour@@ ge ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ ky .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 @-@ 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and with both adults and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular , chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ proteins in plasma should be kept inside the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosphate or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ ys@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is necessary in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) of sodium per gram sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
if R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes stopped before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before birth , it came to les@@ ions in the pyr@@ am@@ ids at the cran@@ ial containers .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ rec@@ tom@@ y patient in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ ia , severe mort@@ cal@@ orie , peripheral Neurop@@ ath@@ y , peripheral Neurop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is compar@@ atively similar to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both coupl@@ ings contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore especially suitable as alternative carrier on excess of excess
based on research on the separation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ ine cycle , poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g of acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the neu@@ rolo@@ gic conditions may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the completed product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C .
for this purpose , the measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient must receive a probe about a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 grams in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzym@@ es , so that they can not ex@@ crete after the consumption of proteins in the body .
if laboratory tests are performed , you must tell the doctor that you can take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , da sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist when you have other drugs or taken recently , even if it is not pres@@ cription drugs .
during the nurs@@ ing time , you will not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because the medicine could go over with breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , tur@@ bul@@ ence , head@@ ache , taste problems , im@@ pregn@@ ation of the body , des@@ ori@@ entations , remin@@ ders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neu@@ rolo@@ gic conditions were observed .

angi@@ ox is applied to treat patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example , un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in breast basket with different thickness ) or my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - lifting &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measuring value of the electro@@ cardi@@ ac or an EK@@ G ) .
angi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients that undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with ang@@ ina or cardi@@ ac arr@@ he@@ a to maintaining blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI option .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS with which the effect of angi@@ ox is in case of a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) which was compared to conventional combination treatment with H@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI .
while the PCI was frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) and they received additional drugs to prevent blood cl@@ ots like Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - when preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac cases or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year , as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was the same as h@@ ep@@ arin , except for heavy blood vessels , with which it was significantly more effective than h@@ ep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients that may possibly be sensitive against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other cer@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
it may also not be used in patients who had recently had a bloo@@ d@@ ung , as well as people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and a removable replacement for H@@ ep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd , a permit for placing An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ mun@@ eration ( IA / N@@ ST@@ E@@ MI ) ) with an emergency handle or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bol@@ ster@@ ity of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a result is performed in the patient &apos;s patients , an additional bol@@ us should be given to 0.5 mg / kg and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI required for clinical development , the reduced inf@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours .
directly before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI option consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bush@@ y of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous infusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
safety and effectiveness of a certain bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , should take place a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT , the re@@ constituted and diluted drugs should be thoroughly administered intraven@@ ously before the application .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg infusion dose is determined correctly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al kidney limitations ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is subjected to a PCI ( whether or not treated with the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine at ACS ) or not a lower inf@@ erior rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , the second bolt dose is 0.3 mg / kg , and the ACT is again to test another 5 minutes after the second bolt of the bolt .
in patients with moderate kidney compensation , which led to approval in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , the ACT counted 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .

patients are treated carefully with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding within the treatment of symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is given in combination with another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if they appear in PCI @-@ patients under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age groups may occur in patients who under@@ pass a per@@ cut@@ aneous corrosion intervention ( PCI ) , while treatment principle occur anywhere in the treatment .
in patients who are taking a war@@ far@@ in and treated with bio@@ degra@@ dation , a monitoring of the IN@@ R Wer@@ ts ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) should be drawn to ensure that the value of the treatment with biogas therapy should be reached again prior to treatment .
starting from the knowledge about the mechanisms of action of anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( H@@ ep@@ arin , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these effici@@ encies increase the risk of blood .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall , the upper th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or was administered as a permanent source with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient ins@@ ulin at the blood of glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or ins@@ ulin cannot be processed .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in distingu@@ ishes itself very slightly from human ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and shorter than a short @-@ term human ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was performed in the application in combination with a long @-@ term ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body does not produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and enrolled 572 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , A@@ pi@@ dra was tested in a study with 8@@ 78 adults in a study of type 2 diabetes .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the modification of the substance called gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.14 % at ins@@ ulin l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % of human @-@ ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra can not be used in patients who possibly are sensitive to ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ ulin or one of the other parts , or in patients who have already suffer hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can be affected in the blood @-@ glu@@ ed levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH a permit for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is either a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the field of abdom@@ inal ceiling , add@@ ressing the th@@ os@@ cope or the delta use by continuous infusion in the field of abdom@@ inal wall .
due to the reduced Glu@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced ins@@ ulin changes the ins@@ ulin need to be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
every change of efficiency , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , car@@ cin@@ ating , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the production method can move a change of the ins@@ ulin .
3 A in@@ sufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment , especially in patients with ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can result in a hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and a diabet@@ ic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the change@@ over of patients to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin should be carried out under str@@ ingent claims and may be necessary to change the dosage .
the point of switching of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia depends on the action profile of the used ins@@ ulin , and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances that can increase the blood glucose activity and increases the inclination to hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ che@@ ating enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , disper@@ op@@ ly@@ c@@ ine , Fi@@ br@@ ate , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phs , pro@@ ff@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ fon@@ amid antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ izers such as Bet@@ ting lock@@ ers , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and ti@@ pping the symptoms of ad@@ r@@ ying con@@ spi@@ ke should be weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experiments on re@@ productive medicine showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin regarding pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether ins@@ ulin is super@@ flu@@ ous in human breast milk , but generally ins@@ ulin doesn &apos;t occur in breast milk , nor is res@@ or@@ ated by oral application .

severe hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ che@@ ating pipes with consciousness can be given by a in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Gl@@ ucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a doctor or by an intraven@@ ous gift of glucose .
after a Gl@@ ucose in a hospital the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause for the heavy hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin reduces blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating the peripheral glucose ( especially through sk@@ el@@ eton mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as through the inhibit@@ or of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous g@@ a- and ins@@ ulin delivery occurs faster and the efficiency time is shorter than hu@@ - man@@ em normal @-@ ins@@ ulin .
in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a vital ous met@@ ering range from 0,0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg with a propor@@ tionally glu@@ ed effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more , a proportional increase of the glu@@ ed effect , exactly as human ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice the fast work schedule as normal human ins@@ ulin and scored the complete glu@@ ed effect for about 2 hours earlier than human ins@@ ulin .
the data was evident that at an application of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ tic control is achieved as with human normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before meal .
ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal was cooked , a better post@@ erior control was reached as with human normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal .
if ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after onset of meal , a comparable boy@@ cot@@ ic control is achieved like in human @-@ ins@@ ulin , which is given to 2 billion before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin delivery at Gabe 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before ) before the meal was given in comparison to human normal ins@@ ulin , which was 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the meal was given ( Figure 1A ) and as compared to human normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
ins@@ ulin delivery at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after ) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human Nor@@ is@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
