<seg id="1">This document provides a summary of the European Public commission (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) is assessed by the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) in order to get to recommendations regarding the application of medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or your treatment, please read the package handling (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacies.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish more information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for intake levels (7.5 mg / ml) and as a injected solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. more thinking and talking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not available), Misstrate and honeys; • bipolar-I disorder, in which the patients become abnormal episodes (periods of normal high spirits) alternately with periods normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abillet is applied for the treatment of severe severe episodes and preventic episodes for patients who have addressed in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection moulding solution is applied to rapid monitoring of increased unrest or behavioural disorders if the oral medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">For both cases, the solution can be applied to the single or melting tablet in patients who prepares the swallowing of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the dose should be removed from ascertained.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works especially as "partial aggression" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but lower than the neurotranglitter workaround the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine at schizophrenia and bipolar disorder occurs with the brain, Aripiprazol helps to normalize the activity of brain, creating psychotic or manic symptoms and their recursive symptoms will be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of asgeneric, the recursive symptoms of symptoms, was examined in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection-related solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar conditions that suffered to increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a further study, Abilical was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilical and placebo which had been stabilized in 160 patients where the symptoms were stabilized with Abilical symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilical injected solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered to increased unrest, with the Lorazepam (another anti-psychological) and placebo over a period of two hours compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change of symptoms of patients with a standard dial for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body is the melting of the melting, and absorbs the solution.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both trials, patients who received Abilical in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger decrease of symptoms of increased restlessness than the patient receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilical in four of the five short-time studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abillet prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than the placebo in previously treated patients treated with previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilical injections in 10- or 15-mg cans were also reduced to placebo than placebo increased unrest and similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilical (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled), acodeficiency (nausea), irritation, sparsely ID (increased saliation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilical during treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and during which the lack of manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol came in response to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection-related disturbance in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes on bipolar-I disorder, when an oral treatment is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. licence for placing on the market of Abilical in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is designed for the treatment of a heavy-polar episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly active episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A increased efficacy of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapies or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With view to the bigger sensitivity of this patient group, lower Initial dose should be considered to be considered as clinical factors (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 is applied to combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The emergence of Sudetric behaviour is one of the psychotic diseases and affection disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antimental therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar troubleshooting no elevated succulum risk with Aripiprazol, compared to other anti-psychotika.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be treated with attention in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infectious disease, cardiovascular disease), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are applied for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure sensitive pharmaceuticals) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesien: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, there was an unusual reports during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with ABILIFY treated patients and symptoms of late dyskinesis, should be drawn into consideration to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient has developed signs and symptoms which led to a mns, or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all anti-psychotica must be removed including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol was supposed to be in patients with crampons in the anamese or states that are in connection with curveins in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old, with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosene patients who were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, an elevated death of death in comparison to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and response to unwanted rovascular events in treated with Aripipol.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoazide or hyperosmolarem coma, was reported in patients who have been treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated that allow directly.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrens patients and patients with bipolar Manie due to comorbidities, the application of anti-psychotics, in which weight gain is observed, or a healthy life of vitality and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effects of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system is careful when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the resorption Rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically unrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol at 107% while the C09 remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolism can result in common use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazol in comparison to CYP2D6 extensively.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the joint gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4-inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits of potential risks in the patients should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, must have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After deposed the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be lifted to the Dosage height before the start of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Dilemazem or or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY together with ABILIFY, can be counted with a constant increase in the Aripiprazol- concentration.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethotamorphan / 3-Methodixymorphan ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextramorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to alert their doctor when pregnant or pregnant women during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data security on humans and due to the concerns during the reproductive studies, this medication may not be applied in the pregnancy, unless the possible use justifies the potential risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">As with other anti-psychotics, the patients should be warned that dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, to use, until they are safe, that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The incidence of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystony and Dyskinesis, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was observed in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% for patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripiprazol and 15.1% was treated with Olanigin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes on bipolar-I disruption - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,5% was in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% was achieved in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17,6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">At a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was treated for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo where potentially significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters resulted in no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">The CPI (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol patients compared to 2.0% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects, which may occur in connection with an antimental therapy, and over their occurrence even in the treatment with Aripiprazol, the malignited neuroleptic syndrome, spawdyskinesis and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch were unintentionally or deliberate acute overdose with Aripiprazol in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without observing time.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information on the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in treating an overdosage with Aripiprazol; it is unlikely that hemodialysis occur in the treatment of an overdosage of benefits because Aripiprazol has a high plasma proteins.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazol at schizophrenia and bipolar-I interrupt through combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptor and antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and for the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptors as well as a moderate affinity for the dopamine D4-, for the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7, to alpha-1-pollution and to the histamine H1N1.</seg>
<seg id="76">At the gift of Aripiprazol at doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed a dossier from 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor-ligations, at Nucleus caudatus and at the Putting.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1.228 schizophrens patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled study, 52% of those patients who held a response to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring instruments intended to be defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- Scale, showed a significantly higher improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34% in the Aripimarzol group and at 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olander-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included in significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7% compared with the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with more flexibly dose over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol revealed a placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior effectiveness against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active monotherapy studies more than 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed up against placebo in week 3 and an accounting effect which was comparable to the result of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazol proved an equivalent percentage of patients with symptomatic remission of the manie on like Lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially reflecting on lithium or Valproat-monotherapy, reflecting an superior effectiveness in reducing diagnostic symptoms in comparison to monotherapies with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks followed by a longtime extension period of over 74 weeks in various patients, Aripiprazol showed up to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bipolar response, mainly in the prevention of an antibipolar response.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 for the stretching of Aripiprazole is responsible, the N-Dealkyl is generated through CYP3A4 catalytic converter.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshal period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol for extensive metabolic applications using CYP2D6 and at almost 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolism of CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as pharmacokinetics schizophrener patients showed no gender dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A broad calculation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no reference to clinically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the effect of the smoker on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and dehydrate Aripiprazol was similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study involving human liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect as regards the impairment of the liver function on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and dehydration of Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to attract slats on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies for safety spharology, toxicity at repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, comotoxicity and the canter potential have no particular hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of men, so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects recorded a dossier dependent side deficiency (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymular corps) at 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 10 mg / kg / day) at the recommended maximum dose of steady-State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a Cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the eradication of sulphate conjugate from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended maximum dose of people from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day) from the recommended maximum dose while people based on mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human gesture, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulphate conjugate from hydroxy- Aripiprazole not found more than 6% of the concentrations that were detected in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages that led to expositions of 3- and 11x of the mid Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="293">Neutropenie was the most striking significant hematological toxicity (79% of patients reported) and was fast reversibly and dosisfied; Leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane patients and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Abraxane as a monotherapy in each dose and indications (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in blood, increased crayine in blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dyspherical, blurns, blasting, blasting, dry mouth, mergophagitis, painful stool, pains in the mouth, oral pain, rectal blood disorders of the kidneys, and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest of chest, weakness of musculature, muscular pain, muscular pain, muscle pain, pains in the skeletal musculature, muscle pain, discomfort in grippers, muscle sounds Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Ruhelosibility 1 The frequency of the sensitivity actions is based on a definitive associated case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no cohaler related to these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubul component, which promotes the collision of Mikrotubul from tubular Indian and stabilizes the microtubul by inhibiting their anolysmerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibitor of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network which is essential for the vitational interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is well known that Albumin transforms of plasma cells into the endothelial cells, and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of albumin to the transport of Paclitaxel supported by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendotheliale transportation through gp 60 Albuminescence is conveyed and a Paclitaxel battery in cysteine in cysteine in cysteine in cysteine in cysteine in cysteine.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two introductory studies and 454 patients that were treated in a randomised phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in shape of an infusion of about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion in over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multieccentric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received a monotherapy of Paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 hour infusion with premedication for prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">When recording to the study, 64% of patients had a affected general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastasestelles.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of the patients had no chemotherapy, 27% had only had a adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only due to metastases and 19% due to metastases and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First-Line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus Paclitaxel was evaluated by an improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy grade 3 in a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural process of peripheral Neuropathy for demolition on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane according to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">Pharmacokinetics of the aggregate Paclitaxel in accordance with 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active exposure (AUC) increased from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 In the intravenous gift of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the Paclitaxel Plasmasts took effect in multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume amounted to 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching exotic distribution and / or small connection from Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">Pharmacokinetics of Paclitaxel were compared with intravenous tumours of Paclitaxel using 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing half-grade Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) than a solvent containing Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in vitro trials of human liver microsome and tissues is reported that Paclitaxel is associated with 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-Dihydroxypaclitaxel) metabolizes.</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative agents was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolic rate 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitas, which indicates a far non-renal Clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, over patients at the age of more than 75 years, however, only few dates are available, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is a biological medicine which is already approved in the European Union (EU) and also contains the same substance (also called "Reference Medications").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels, in which a blood-transfusion complications could not occur if the intervention is not possible, and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with seduces must be led under the supervision of a physician, who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses that is indicated for the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self-bleeding, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervisor, so that they have received a reasonable guide.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal failure, or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobbinaries should always be in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per employee in adults respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The Iron values of all patients are required before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency is, and iron ore products should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who receive a chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems can be caused anemia caused by a erythropoietle deficiency or that the body does not suffice to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by one cell in which a gene (DNA) was involved in the formation of epochetalfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to administration as a injection into a vein in the frame of a main study with 479 patients caused by kidney problems caused anemia.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participated in this study had been injected at least eight weeks, Eprex / Erypo in a Vene before they were either killed on seducts or continue Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the modification of the hemoglobbinaries between the beginning of the study and the completion period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">Furthermore, the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of the skin speculated Abseamed showed that of the treatment of Eprex / Erypo for 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who were caused by kidney problems caused anemia, the hemoglobbinaries of patients who were put on seducers were reckoned on the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients continued to have Eprex / Erypo, an increase of 0.063 g / ddl of the output value from 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which occasionally occur as abrupt, stinging migraine headache and turbulence.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who possibly are insensitive (allergic) against epochealfa or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Sefamed as a injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems because other studies are necessary to ensure that these are not an allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that for seduces, according to the regulations of the European Union of proof, it was a comparable quality, safety and economic profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, the seamed, is prepared for medical professionals in all Member States information, including information about the safety of medicines.</seg>

<seg id="386">Claims and successors may vary depending on age, gender and total disease last; therefore, the assessment of individual clinical trials and diseases are required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise of hemoglobs by more than 2 g / ddl (1.25 mmol / l) over a four-week period should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients occasionally, individual hemoglobbinaries can be observed or under the hemoglob- target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of these hemoglobbability the hemoglobin-management should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin concentration of 10 g / ddl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / ddl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobbins exceeds 2 g / ddl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / ddl (7.5 mmol / l), the epochon-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be close to safe, in order to ensure that epochin alfa in the lowest permitted dose, is required for the control of anaemia and anaerobymptome.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with an extremely low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) might require higher yield doses than patients where the initial deposit is less badly (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="401">However, the hemoglobbinate value by &lt; 1 g / L (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the retinulozytensions increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl from the initial value, a response to the epic-alfa-therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with light anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the prefixes of ≥ 4 blood canned foods should be obtained twice weekly for 3 weeks before the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Thus early as possible - for example, a few weeks prior to the beginning of the autologous bloodwork programme - should be started, so before the start of the seducal therapy great iron reserves are available.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 CPU / kg epochealfa, which should be given once weekly over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery procedure and the day of surgery (day 0) should be given.</seg>

<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies did not show any significant benefit from the gift of epoystic concentrations, when the hemoglobbination exceeds the concentration of anaerobymptome and avoidance of blood transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobster increase should amount to approximately 1 g / ddl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / ddl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">Patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evidence of coronary heart disease should not be exceeded in the 4.2 recommended upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to these findings, the treatment of anaemia in adults with renal insufficiency are not accelerated to accelerate the progression of renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="420">In patients with tumor-patients receiving chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epochin-alfa-gift and the Erythropoetin response should be considered (patients who may have to be transfited).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must minimize the risk for possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with the goal of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>

<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Zoledron concentrations by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminded Clearance by Cytochrome P450 enzymers metabolic substances is unlikely to metabolized because CNoledeic acid is not metabolized because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, fuel-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2), renal Clearance of Zoledeic acid correlated with the Kreatine Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the craatinine Clearance, and the average number of patients studied at the average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function until down to a creatinine Clearance up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the coledacid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because of severe kidney malfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), only restricted data are not possible for this population.</seg>

<seg id="749">A summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Business Report (EPAR), which will be assessed by the Committee for Human Use (CHMP), in order to get to recommendations regarding the application of medicines.</seg>
<seg id="750">Accounts is applied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent) patients (especially overweight patients), in which metformin (a diabetic medicine) is not performed. • It can be used together with another diabetic medicine (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition, it can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that can not be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfiylsalnant or insulin, the old dose of the sulphate resin amount or insulin can be maintained with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar level), except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the amount of the sulphate content / insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, so that type 2 diabetes can be better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acettos in tripletherapy was examined; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfiylsalac, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycopylified hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which shows how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a decrease in HbA1c value, which makes it possible to reduce blood glucose levels when using doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Triplea study, the effect of additional administration of action contributed to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphate material in a decrease of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who received ActA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in the patients who took placebo in addition.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in connection with Actos were vision disorders, infections of the upper respiratory tracts, weight gain and hypothesis (reduced sensitivity to maturity).</seg>
<seg id="760">Accounts may not respond to patients that may not react to patients that may not react to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic Ketoia (high blood levels - acid).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Accars should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin for patients where Metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000 the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approval for placing action in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until whitish, round, vaulted and carry on a side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also shown for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin insufficient and in which metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by at least one risk factor (e.g. early heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain or eyelids, particularly those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain and eyelids are observed when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular disease study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macular disease has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study demonstrated an increase of reports on heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output current (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm range) or with other signs of a liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the normality are increased, the liver parameters are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If such patient symptoms have developed to hinder a hepatic irritability, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, torment, tiredness, appetite and / or darker harn, are the liver parameters.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision on whether the treatment of the patients with Pioglitazone should be continued until the procedure of the laboratory parameters should be directed by the clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dossier dependent weight gain was proven that can be stirred from fat deposits and related in some cases with a liquid sample.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, under the therapy with Pioglitazone, a minor reduction in the mean hemoglobbance (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobs by 3-4% and hematocrits by 3.6-4.1%) and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobs by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitivity, patients who have pioglitazone as a two-fold or triple combination therapy with a sulphate combination with insulin, the risk of a dosisdependant hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, thiazolidindices, including Pioglitazone, was reported using an appearance or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but linked doctors should report to the possibility of a macular edema; a suitable ophthalmologic examination should be considered to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages undesirable events concerning bone arries from randomised, controlled, dual-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="782">The projectancy rate was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures in 100 patients with women who were treated with a reference medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular disease, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures in 100 patients) with pioglitazone treated with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures in 100 patients) with patients who were treated with a reference medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of pregnancy, if one patient wishes for a pregnancy or who occurs this is the treatment (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of the interactions have shown that pioglitazon has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical industry of Digoxin, Warcolor, PhenproCoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interaction with medicines that can be metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contractors, Cyclosporin, calcium carbonate, calcium chloride, and HMGCoA-reductspice are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with fibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone to 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a decrease in AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the treatment with pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulanemia and increased insulin-resistant infins of maternal substrates and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refractive index of the lens as well as in other hypoglytic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">There were ALT-Anstents in clinical trials over three times the upper limit of the normalization beyond placebo, however more rarely than in comparative groups under Metformin or Sulfonylsalas.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a Outcome study in patients with pre-existing macrovascular disease was the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone by 1.6% higher than in placebo when Pioglitazon bzw</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its market launch, rarely more than congestive heart failure under Pioglitazon reports, however, when pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of notifications due to inhibitions from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone treated groups and more than 7,400 patients treated in comparative study patients.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of current proactive study, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) who were treated with pioglitazone treated with 23 / 905 (2.5%) who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day had no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to effect over a activation of specific kernel acceptance (peroxisome proliferator activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which leads to an increased insensitivity of liver, grease and skeleton musculcells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver, and the peripheral happiness increases in case of insulin-resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as a monotherapy has been continued over two years in order to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic efficiency (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">Blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) after two years after therapy was determined by Pioglitazone in 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study about 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was recruited in spite of three-month optimisation, with insulin had to be randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">Patients under Pioglitazon reduced the mean HbA1c - value by 0.45%, compared to the patients who continue to receive non-insulin, a reduction of the insulin pation in the group treated with Pioglitazone group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials over one year showed a statistically significant decline in the album / craatinine source in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapies with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18-week study on type 2 diabetic tests.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma-triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase of HDL- cholesterol levels and slightly but clinically significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">Clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazid the total plasmatriol des and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, under Pioglitazone there was no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel while under Metformin and Gliclazid reduced values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the wet triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this is an effect on triglycerid absorption as well as on the epic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease were randomised in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to an existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, Pioglitazone is resorously absorbed, whereby the top concentric concentrations of pioglitazone is usually reached for 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness in roughly three times of the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interaction Studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical industry of Digoxin, Warcolor, PhenproCoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with fibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactive waste pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the foothache (55%) and to a lower extent in the harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination period of the unaltered dumoglitazone is 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolic syndrome is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower than in healthy subjects in patients with reduced kidney function, but resemble the rates of the oratory Clearance of the parent.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, pursuant to repeated administration volume enlargement with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric cardiac disease.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the treatment with pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulanemia and increased insulin-resistant and increased insulin subsidies for reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), hyperplasia suffer from hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (with male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>

<seg id="822">The tablets are white until whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The projectancy rate was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures in 100 patients with women who were treated with a reference medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular disease, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures in 100 patients) with pioglitazone treated with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures in 100 patients) with patients who were treated with a reference medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazon or gliclazid were studied.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decline in the album / craatinine source in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon was not only the wet triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this can be seen on the Tryglyzerid absorption as well as for the hepatic tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the aim of their primary endpoint, which resulted in a combination of the overall mortality, non-deadly myocardiarisation, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary revolascularization and Revascularization of the leg arteries that are associated with taking Pioglitazone no cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white until whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarizing analysis of notifications due to inhibitions of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,400 patients treated with Pioglitazone, showed an increased incidence of bone broods in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular disease, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures in 100 patients) with pioglitazone treated with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures in 100 patients) with patients who were treated with a reference medication.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft reactions or to an increased incidence of side effects, including undertakings or immunity.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the narrow control in transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be primarily based on the clinical evaluation of derivative and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-reflective regulations (see below "recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After the switch from Prograf to Advagraf you should control the Tacrolimus Talar level in front of the conversion and via two weeks after switching.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, the systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable to both forums and kidney transplantations.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus Talar is recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under Advagraf to ensure adequate substance exposure in immediate retransplantation phase.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Further dose adaptable can be later required, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of patients after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of transplantation The orale Advance therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift at the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - changeover from Prograf to Advagraf must be changed from a daily dosage of prograf capsules to a once daily dosage of Advagraf at once daily dosage of 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant after conversion from other immunomressants to Advagraf once a day the treatment with the recommended initial and liver transplant are recommended for prophylaxis of the graft reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Cardiac transplant In adult patients that are converted to Advancards, an oral initialdose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is to be taken once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant receivers although there is no clinical experience with Cradle for pneumonia, pancreas and mutually transplanted patients, came in an oral initiating dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplantation in an oral initiation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function exerts no effect on pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum crucible) is recommended to calculate the amount of cancerinine and a monitoring of the urinary.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advagraf At conversion from a Ciclospor- to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is caution (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the Talar level in the whole blood The dosage should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of dismissal and tolerability in individual cases under infeed of whole blood-Tacrolimus-valley controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to conduct frequent controls in the Tacrolimus valley during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talar-mirror of Tacrolimus should also be inspected according to Prograf on Advagraf, dosages, modifications of immune depression treatment or simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tacrolimus full blood concentrations (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since there is a drug with a low Clearance, there may be several days, even until the Steady State entered the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials should make sure that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the tallow levels should not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the Taltitudes of Tacrolimus are usually in the blood of liver transplant usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with extransplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance of liver and kidney transplantation, blood concentrations in the field of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including transplants, or other side effects, which may occur in a sequence of Tacrolimus under- or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the narrow control of one medicine in transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of growing patients with graft reactions, that have proven to other immunomressants as a therapist, there are no clinical data for the retardized formulation of Advancers.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For the prophylaxis of the transplant graft during adult cardiac grafts and transplants still have no clinical data for the retardized formulation of Cagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interaction, which can lead to a downforce of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of plant medications included, or other plants, during a treatment with Advagraf (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentration in blood is offered as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subjected to such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf a group of group or septum-hypertrophy was observed, which therefore may occur in advance at the agraf under Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders, are already existing cardiac suffering, a treatment with corticoeroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, liquid overloading and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunohressiva, the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of malignant skin due to appropriate clothing or using a protection factor with a high protective factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">Simultaneous use of medicinal or vegetable medicinal products, which are known as inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can increase the metabolism of Tacrolimus and therefore reduce blood values from Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels with simultaneous gift of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain even more excessive concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (one by the lack of factor VIII, congenital bleeding).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosing and frequency of the application indicate whether they were used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding associated with surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from factor VIII lack, which causes blood clotting problems like bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa will not extract from human plasma, but is labelled as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by one cell in which a gene (DNA) was involved in the formation of the human Gerber factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advates is a different drug approved in the European Union called Recombinate, unlike, is unlike differently, so the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe severe Hämophilia A, among them a study involving 53 children under six years, the application of the drugs is examined as prevention of hemorrhage and surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of Advocate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood vessels with "excellent" or "good" evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advocate (observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pains (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be applied in patients who possibly have oppressed (allergic) against human Gerber factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for placing the placing on the market in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution is done after the severity of factor VIII, after the place and the magnitude of blood and clinical state of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1542">At the following hämorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not drop below the specified plasma level (in% of the standard or in i.e. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and the acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk of patients passed away.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment course, for controlling the dose and frequency of injections a reasonable determination of factor VIII-Plasmasptile is enriched.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can distinguish themselves in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half tones.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma has not achieved, or if the bleeding is not ruled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out to imitate an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosing rate should not be exceeded after loading the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagatorial activity by factor VIII made by IgG Immunoglobin who are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibition, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 Excavities is most dependent on the largest and of genetic and other factors.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people for the protection against influenza, which is caused by the trunk (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a strain of flu virus that may cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A influenza pandemic breaks out if a new tribe of the flu virus has to spread, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against people.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts contained in the vaccine known in the vaccine, and forming antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in a position to form a touch with a Grippevirus of this common monoclonal antibody.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membranes of the virus was removed with the "surface anic" (proteins on the membrane surface, detects the human body as a body-foreign) and is used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not performed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This gives the scope of the scope of the clinical data base to meet the assessment of vaccination of vaccination as well as to meet the requirements of the EMEA to prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment, please contact your treatments doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you wish more information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), which caused the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For those who can't swallow the capsules, Agenase may not be taken as a solution, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should then be instituted if the doctor has examined the antiviral drugs of the patient previously, and the likelihood discerned that the virus may be addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenase reduces the people in combination with other antiviral medicines in the blood and keep it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not cure diseases, however, the damage of the immune system and therefore does not hesitate to develop the development of AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase was examined in combination with other antiviral medicines, however without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who were previously treated with protease inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This drug with low dosified Ritonavir reinforced pharmaceuticals was compared with 206 adults who had taken earlier protease inhibitors, compared with other proteins.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentrations of HIV in blood (viruslast) or change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had taken no protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks in Agenase, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than in placebo, but Agenase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced the viral load, however, with the children who had been treated with protease inhibiting, only very few for the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated with protease inhibiting, the viral load was the viral load as effective after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant against four other protease inhibitor, it came under Agenonavir to a stronger waste of viral load after four weeks as in the patients who continued their previous Proteasant.</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (malfall), nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase should not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive against Ambavarr or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase may also be used in patients receiving Johanniscabbage (a plant compound for the treatment of depression) or medicinal products, which are treated equally as Agenase and are harmful in high concentrations in blood health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">How other drugs against HIV is in patients who take blood cells, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoekrose (extinction of bone tissue) or an immunoretic syndromes (symptoms of an infection which are caused by recovered Immune System).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Gender Equality Committee reached the conclusion that the benefits of Agenase in use in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of treated HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is usually taken together with pharmacokinetics Ritonavir, but the Committee established that the benefit of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have taken no protease inhibitor is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was originally licensed under "extraordinary circumstances since the time of approval for scientific reasons only had limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued Glaxo Group Limited for the market launch of Agenase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor (PI) -previously treated adults and children from 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenase capsules to pharmacokinetics of Ambavr can be taken together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambavr should be done considering the individual viral resistance measurement and pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bio availability of Ambavr as a solution for intake is 14% lower than one capsule; therefore, Agenase capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligrams per milligram basis, not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules amounts to 600 mg Amfravir twice daily together with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenase capsules are applied without the enhanced additive of Ritonavir (boosters), higher doses have to be applied to Agenonavir (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules amounts to 20 mg of amulvir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Amblown tavr that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibiting were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the absence of data to the uncertainty and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenase capsules in adult patients with medium-severe liver function was reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be patient with light or even liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-indicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also the substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isobeet 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal joints that contain Johanniskraut (hypericum perforation) may not be applied because of the risk-reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Ambavr during the intake of Ambavr (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">The patients should be noted that Agenase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not result in a cure of HIV infection that they can continue to develop opportunist infections, or complications of a HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with Agenase does not prevent the risk of a transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who are treated with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy, have an increased risk for severe liver problems with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneously antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the related information of this medicinal product.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing restricted liver function including chronic hepatitis C shows an increased frequency of liver function disorders under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenase and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other glucocaoids, which are changed over CYP3A4, unless the possible benefits of a treatment is the risk of systemic cortikosteroider effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Because the fuel exchange of the HMG-Coa reductase inhibitors strongly depends on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenase and Simvastatin is not recommended for increased risk of myopathy including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenyltoin, phytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under surveillance of the International Standards ratio), are methods to determine the concentration of active concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medication at the same time, Agenase can be less effective because of reduced plasma concentration of Ambavr (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with ambavavir, the efficacy of hormonal contradiction can be changed, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadon is given at the same time with ambigur, the patient should therefore be monitored to opiatentanthem, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of a toxicity because of the high propyl-fat content of the Agenase, this formulation is conferred in children under an age of four years and should be used with some other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenase should be set on duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitor, was reported about the occurrence of Diabetes Mellitus, hyperglycemia or a result of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other illnesses that were necessary for their therapy to be associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>

<seg id="1956">In haemophile patients (type A and B), which were treated with protease inhibiting, there are reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous mutans hematome and Hämarthroat.</seg>
<seg id="1957">With HIV-infected patients with severe immundefective patients, an anti-inflamviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an anti-inflamatic reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunist infections which leads to severe clinical trials or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial eneology is believed (including use of grain liver, alcohol consumption, heavy immune disease index), cases of osteonecrosis reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width of Agenase may not simultaneously provide a small therapeutic width and also the substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isobeet 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low therapeutic width apgenase with Ritonavir may not be used together with drugs, the active substances used mainly via CYP2D6, and are associated with serious plasma concentration and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ambavir that can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resistance performance.</seg>
<seg id="1962">During the attempt, the lowest plasma concentration by a dose of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, were observed very often undesirable effects at the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskraut (hypericum perforation) The serum levels of Ambavr can be abased by simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with currant (hypericum perforation).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient receiving Johanniskraut, the amusavirus are, and, if possible, check the viral load and add the Johanniskraut.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nelfinvir is administered together with Ambavr (see also Eat irence below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase, for Cups by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with ambaved capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg Ambavr were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily to prove the efficacy and imaging of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Ambavr (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ambavr (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily) were approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ambavr (600 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Ambavr and Kaletra can not be given, but it is recommended for engaging, because the effectiveness and inability of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetist study for the application of Agenase in combination with Didanosin is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenase is at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore at the gift of Elinirence in combination with Ambavr (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efracence in combination with Ambavavir and Saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protein splendor would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin based on other protease inhibitor and existing limited information can be assumed that Nevirapin reduces the serum concentration of Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medication should be used simultaneously, be careful because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly a subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When this product is applied together, be careful; a thorough clinical and rological monitoring is supposed to be difficult, as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of Ambavr and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of retinal gas concentrations (AUC) resulted in a rise in the plasma concentration of 193% and thus too an increase in Rifugutin related side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">When it is required for clinical reasons, Riuutin together with Agenase is recommended to achieve a reduction of the dosage of rigs in at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma concentration of both medicinal products could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of 700 mg of fiosamparr, and 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily led to an increase in the Cmax of Ketoconazole in serum levels by 25% and AUC (0-4) to the value which was observed after 200 mg of Ketoconazole a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including sub-strate, Hemmer or inductors of CYP3A4, can be applied to interactions together with Agenase, possibly interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be connected to toxic reactions, which are used with these medicines if they are used in combination with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitor, Antazida can not be taken at the same time as Agenase, as it can come to resorption disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anti-vulsiva that are known as enzymes (phenyl toin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with Ambavavir can lead to a abased the plasma spot of Ambavr.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of calcium-channel blockers such as Amlodipin, dipldipin, ndudipin, Nimodipine, Nifedipin, Nimodipine, Necdipin and Verapamil can be increased 10 through amblown vir, reducing the activity and toxicity of this medication.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake of Agenase, its plasma concentration can increase considerably and strengthen with PDE5 inhibitors in combination with pteristrates, tensions and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of Fluticulonpropionat intransplal (4 times daily) over 7 days increased to volunteers, while the endogenous Kortisol grew about 86% (90% -convey interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenonavir is not recommended along with these glucose corridors, unless the possible benefits of a treatment is the risk of systemic cortex-eroider effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-Coa reductase, such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose fuel exchange is strongly dependent of CYP3A4, increases increases of plasma concentration in simultaneous administration of Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases this HMG-Coa reductase inhibitors for myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of this medicinal product is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as recommended as stabilization of the mirror, as the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous gift of Ambavr (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenase should not be used together with oral-recorded Midazolam (see section 4.3) while at the simultaneous application of Agenase with parlative Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous application of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma concentration of Midazolam around 3-4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadon is administered together with ambavavir, the patient should therefore be monitored to opiatentanthem, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of its low reliability of historical comparisons you can currently be given no recommendation, such as the amusavir- dose if Ambavr is administered simultaneously with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In case of simultaneous gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, it is recommended for increased control of INR (International normalised ratio) because of the possibility of weakening or amplification of the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contradiction is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods for contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in simultaneous gift of Agenase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful abolition of the possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk enabled rats, Ambavr related materials have been proven, however, it is not known whether amonavir is over with breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study on pregnant rats, which was administered by the onset in the uterus to the end of the nursing time Ambavr, showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight when postponed.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring including fertility and reproduction was not impaired by administration of Ambavr on maternity.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The Indictability of Agenase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years and studied clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the effects related to the Agenase treatment of side effects were slightly extended until moderate, occurred early and conducted seldom to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events is not clarified whether they are related to HIV-treatment or any other HIV-treatment simultaneously, or whether they are a result of horsunderage.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side-mentioned side effects were taken from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with protease inhibiting did not received 1200 mg Agenase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (grade 2 to 4), noted by the investigator as associated with the study medication, were listed and present in more than 1% of patients, as well under the treatment of responsive laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV-patients, including a loss of peripheral fat tissue, more intraocular and visceral tissues, hypertrophy of the breasts and dormanneatal tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral not treated persons treated with Ambavr in combination with lamivudin / Zidovudin for a medium duration of 36 weeks, only one case (bulbaked) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 patients were represented at 245 NRTI- previously treated patients under Ambavavir 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a median duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skillnesses were normally pronounced as moderate to moderate, erythematous or maculopulous nature, with or without Juckreiz and occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without the treatment with amusvir had to be demolished.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonekrose, especially in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">With HIV-infected patients with severe immundefective patients, antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg Agenase twice daily together with low dose of Ritonavir (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which were observed among women's glyceride and CPI values, which received Agenase, together with low dose of Ritonavir, very frequently.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdosage the patient is observed on signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8), if necessary, necessary support measures are included.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ambavr binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and prevents the processions of viral gag- and gag-pol- polyproteins in the sequence of education, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Ambavr in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was diagnosed in both acute and chronic lymphocytes tissue lines (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of Ambavir lies in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acute cells and is 0,41 µM in chronic cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The link between the activity of Ambavr against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of the HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In treatment of antiretroviral not pre-treated patients with currently permitted Fosamparr / Ritonavir doses have been observed, as with other Ritonavir treatment schemas with protease inhibitors - described in rare cases.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen out of 434 antiretroviral did not previously treated patients with 100mg of Ritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to 48, whereby 14 isolates could be studied.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of the isolate of 13 children from 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients showed, resistance patterns, which were similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 and of their extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) with protease inhibiting patients appeared in patients with four rological articles over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitor to:</seg>
<seg id="2025">For genotypical resistance testing, Genotypic interpretations can be applied to estimation of the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defined resistance than the presence of mutations V32I / I, L33A / C / W / W / C, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypical resistance on Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir as well as a reduced likelihood of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions as regards the relevance of certain mutations or mutation template can be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to attract the latest interpretations systems for analysis of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing analyses in combination with the genotypical data for estimation of the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clinically-phenotypic Cut-offs (dividing points) for FPV / RTV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with an inclined sensitivity against Ambavir associated genetics creates a certain cloister against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cloister between Ambavr and other protease inhibiting for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not pre-treated patients (one of them had a resistance to Lopinavir and Saquinavir (three of 25 Isolate), Washing Ink 2 / Ritonavir (three of 24 Isolate), Saquinavir (three of 24 Isolate), and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 Isolate).</seg>
<seg id="2033">In reverse, Ambavr reserves the activity against some other protease inhibitor resistant isolates; upon receipt of this activity, the number and resistance of resistance mutations is dependent on the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early termination of an aggression therapy is recommended to keep up the accumulation of a variety of mutations in the borders which can result in the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The receipt of the efficacy of Agenonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised trial, in which with PI pretreated adults (600 mg twice daily) and nucleosidy (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with lowest Ritonavir "boostert," received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore and sixty-three (s = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity versus the Agenase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis turned the non-sub-security of APV / Ritonavir in comparison to the SOC-PI group in terms of time-adjusted average reduction of the output value (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-underwater wave of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unborn Agenase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenase provides solution to intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of those treated with PI had previously treated at least one (78%) or two (42%) together with ARTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients in the study included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in an median increase of CD4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered as anticipated benefit with PI's children who are expected to be considered an unexpected benefit of "unused" Agenase. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambavr is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for Cups by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered along with ambavavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">Administration of Ambavr with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on concentration of amplavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remains unaffected by the food intake although the concurrent food intake influences the magnitude and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approx. 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an unexpected penetration of Ambavr from blood circulation in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This amendment leads to a decrease in the total concentration of active ingredients in plasma, with the amount of unbound Ambavr that remains the active part, probably unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound Ambavr remains constant, the percentage of free active constituents during the dosing intervals in the Steady state concentration in the steady state over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicinal product, CYP3A4 or inhibitions or inhibitions or respectively, must be given to be given at the same time when they are given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg times daily, leads to a similar daily ambulbular exposure such as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavr is from the solution 14% less flexible than the capsules; therefore, Agenase Solution and Agenase capsules are not interchangeable on a millionbasis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of a renal function is likely to reduce the elimination of ambavavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to Ambavir-Plasmaspies which is comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Ambavr twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for the carcinogenicity of mice and rats occurred among male animals renigne hepatoma cells in dosages that followed the 2.0 times (mice) or 3,8 times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice a daily gift of 1200 mg Amblown.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hephepatoma cells and carcinoma were not yet resolved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present assessment data on humans, both of clinical studies as well as from therapeutic application, however, some evidence for accepting a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro diagnostic tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphoma test, micro-core tests on human peripheral lymphocytes included, was Ambavirus nor presumed toxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical use by measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far in clinical trials any significant liver toxicity was observed, neither during the administration of Agenase even after the treatment of therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies for toxicity in young animals, which were treated from 4 days at the age of 4, showed a high mortality in both the control and with ambaved animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">However, at a systemic plasma exposition the significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) was observed, however, a number of minor changes including thymuselongation and minor changes were observed, which indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenase capsules are applied without the enhanced additive of Ritonavir (Bookings), higher doses have to be applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules amounts to 20 mg of amulvir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Amblown tavr that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be observed in patients with weak or light liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-indicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenyltoin, phytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under surveillance of the International Standards ratio), are methods to determine the concentration of active concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients also should remain monitored continuously, and the infusion of aldurazyme should only be provided within a reasonable clinical environment in the recovery equipment for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, nearly all patients IgG antibodies are forming against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusions, must be treated with caution when applying Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="2327">A single year-old open phase 2 study was carried out in which primarily the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was studied at 20 patients, which at the time of their recording to the study was under 5 years old (16 patients with a heavy duty shape and 4 with middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosing was increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks due to increased GAG- mirror in the Harn in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size of magnitude (n = 7) and one weight gain (n = 3) was found according to the Z-score for those aged form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with mean delay form, whereas in the older patients with severe depression and no progress in cognitive development were observed.</seg>

<seg id="2526">Animal experiments shown no direct or indirect effects of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and depend on the pharmacological effect of the pharmaceuticals, as the absorption of recorded fat is avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (an medicinal that can be used as an anti-emetry).</seg>
<seg id="2610">Application for patients under 18 years of age are not recommended since the effects in this age group is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient preventing a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), by receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemicals therapies, which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are, 59% of the patients who have been treated with aloes in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (132 by 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">During chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting are, 81% of the patients who were treated with aloes in the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy alone (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolassetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolassetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>

<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: prevention of acute maline and vomiting for strong chemotherapy due to cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting for moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced through a highly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding a Corticosteroids before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon passage, patients with amnesty or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3-antagonists, however, be careful with the simultaneous gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or by patient where the QT- interval is extended or which tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with a further chemical therapeutics gift, Aloxi in the days after chemotherapy was neither used for prevention nor to treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>

<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-static concentration of Metoclopramids, of a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one population based pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamodarone, coxetine, paroxetine, paroxetine, partralin, sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the cleance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not before, therefore the Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women, unless it is necessary by the previously treated doctor.</seg>

<seg id="2634">Following the findings of clinical research, Palonosetron has the ability to block the formation of the ventricular deformation and repeating the duration of the shareholder.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the survey carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the evaluation of the ECG-effects of I.V. in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg in single doses.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to intravenous gift follows an initial decrease of Plasmaconcentrates a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally disproportionately in the total dose range of 0,3- 90 μ / kg in patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to the intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured in 11 hok carcinoma patients between day 1 and day 5 (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron-Plasmasts at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, that at once daily intravenous administration from 0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days, total exposure (AUC0- ∞) was comparable to a time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was 0.75 mg higher after the one time.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminates with the kidneys, and some 50% are converted into two primary metabolic cases, compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonist effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro clinical trials for metabolic symptoms have demonstrated that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination of an intravenous dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose have been found in urine, Palonosetron made up about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">According to a one-time intravenous injection of patients, the total body weight amounted to 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver function, the terminal Eliminationshal time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increases, a reduction of dose is however not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions that are considered adequate over the maximum of humanist exposure, which indicates a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies indicate that palm oil can block only in very high concentrations of ioning channels, which are involved in the ventricular deformation and repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose induced in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure in humans), who were given daily over two years, resulted in an increasingly incidence of liver tumors, endocrine Neoplasmen (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, anniermark) and skin tumors with rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely unknown, but due to the used high doses and da Aloxi at a time for one-time application, the relevance of these results will be assessed as one for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns are noted, that data on the stability of the active and market product are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C affecting the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was inflamed with more patients than at the reference point; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the study used in the study was to evaluate the medicine a immune response (i.e. the body creates antibodies - special proteins - against the pharmaceuticals), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (one with crucifixes for continuous skin infection) and small infected Lazerations (Rissor or keroshen), deflees and intact wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is intended to be used for the treatment of infections, which were detectable or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because burgo against this type of infections may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients with the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin surface must not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment within two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient and consider alternative treatments in consideration.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It affects the bacterial Ribosomes (the parts of bacterienzelle, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was rejected by the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 patients (85.6%) of the 139 patients underneath Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of the 71 patients underneath the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with skin dies, about 90% of patients were treated with both groups.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, Altargo was detected in the treatment of wasteways (failed cavities in the body tissue) or of infections, which were detectable, or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most frequent tributary effect with altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 from 100 patients) is a maturation at the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo during short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections, compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirations, breakthroughs or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">The European Commission issued Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the market launch of Altargo into the entire European Union in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients, which shows no improvement within two to three days, should be considered adequate, and an alternative therapy are considered to be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a Sensibilization or a heavy attack by the application of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is canceled, the ointment carefully wiped and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is supposed to be applied for the treatment of infections, where MRSA is known as a pathogen, is assumed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary wounds caused the efficacy of Retapamulin in patients with infections which were caused by a methicillin-resistant forklihylococcus aureus (MRSA), was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered as a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvements or deterioration of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of retriapamulin and other topical means of the same skin surface has not been examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentration, which have been achieved by people after topical application, or infected with superficial manner in vivo, a clinically relevant shirts in vivo can not be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3. after the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg of Ketoconazole, the medium retinotulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe applied to the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure according to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not necessary, when topical Retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction elasticity after oral care and are insufficient for reference to impact on the birth and the reddish / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">In pregnancy Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clear and the use of Retapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic to avoid.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision on whether the breastfeeding continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo continued / finish, is between the benefit of the nursing for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials in 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo had applied, the most frequently reported anritation in the passage that affects approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Action of Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis due to a specific binding point of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial Ribosom, distinguishes itself from the binding positions of other ribosom antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data suggest that the Ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomal P-Binary centre and the Peptide-transferable Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Due to binding at this binding point, Pleuromutiline to block the peptidyltransferred, are blocking partly P-binder interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance the resistance of Retapamulin should appear at least some infection forms, an advice should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity from Retapamulin at S.aureus, irrespective of whether the insulator were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treat the treatment with S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulant factors (such as PVL = Panton-valine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults was applied 1% Retapamulin salbe daily under occlusion and placed on shielded skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), the 1% Retapamulin Salbe received twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary wounds, individual plasma proteins were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The rehearsal was performed on days 3 or 4 during adult patients in front of the mediation and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual system for people after topical application of 1% Salbe applied to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP shirts.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolic syndrome in human liver microsomes became mainly conveyed by CYP3A4, under small participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix will be used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) for children aged between one and 15 years that have not been immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied as part of two doses existing vaccines, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may not be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used when immunisation has a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that it can be led out of two doses existing vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a cancellation dose against hepatitis A or B is required, Ambirix or another Hepatitis A- or -B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines effect by bringing the immune system (the natural body of the body), "as it can defend against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens than a "foreign" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the new vaccine Twinrix adult and the new vaccine Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect against the same diseases, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are given as part of three doses existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data covering the application of Twinrix adults are also used as a letter for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection of a protective antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine is compared with six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led me from 98 to 100% of imminated children one month after the last injection of the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar at a 6 - and a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccination boxes) are headaches, Appetitdeficiency, pain due to injection point, redness, matriment (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not react to the active substances that may not react to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. a permit for the placing on the market of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard dimentation plan for the layouts with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the appointment of the election, and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a guide is walled for Hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovent vaccines or a combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis C anti-hepatitis (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as according to vaccination with the particular monovalants.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured whether immunity competent individuals who have addressed to a Hepatitis A- Imvaccine will need to be protected as a protection because they may also be protected in no more detectable antibodies due to the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3. as with all injection practices, one anaphylactic reaction should be immediately available in accordance with the gift of the vaccine treatment that will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the flobdiaphragema is recommended, which contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of combinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Using hemodialysis patients and persons with disruptions of the immune system, there is no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBS-antibodies resulting in these cases the gift of further vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimum success towards a suboptimum success, the injection paths should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, Ambirix may be injected at Thrombozytopenia or blood cline disturbance, as it can be injected in these cases after intramusculent gift.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the form of a separate injections at the same time with a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, azellular Pertussis, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib), was the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immune depression or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that potentially adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccination units of this formulation, the frequency of pain, tube, swelling, gastroenteritis, headache, gastroenteritis, headache and fever comparable with the frequency of vaccination and preservative vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses are accompanied by a total of 1027 Impairings at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-cans match combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher ranges of pain and matridity on a calculation basis per vaccination ambient Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% of the subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3-cans.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix was given, about pain, compared with 63.8% of the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The incidence of Mats was similar high (i.e. above the total vaccination cycle at 39,6% of subjects who received Ambirix, compared with 36.2% of the subjects who received the 3-cans combine material).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency increased pain and matridity was low and comparable to the combination of the combination of combination with the 3-doses vaccination scheme was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year Impaired, the occurrence of local reactions and general actions in the Ambient group compares with the 3-cans match combination with 360 ELISA units formed inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of combinant Hepatitis B Surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However after vaccination with Ambirix a common occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, was not per subject.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of Impaired on severe side effects during the 2-doses of vaccination using Ambirix or during the 3-doses-vaccination with the combination imply Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B, was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were carried out at Impairingen in the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the seropoconsion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% had a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, month 6, administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seropoconsion rates for Anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, month 6, administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study that was carried out in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two cans Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combinatification with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people, whose immunity was evaluated, the titoprotates rates (SP in table below) was significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6, according to the gift of the 3-dose elements significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response in a clinical study of 1- to 11-year-olds were reported one month after the completion of the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the Impairings received either a 2-doses of vaccines with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccine, with 360 ELISA units formed inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B Surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were at the time of the footprint between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies were detected at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunodeficiency observed in this study was comparable to the anti-vaccination of 3 cans with a combination simulations, consisting of 360 ELISA units formed inactivated hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies is comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 month vaccines which is equivalent to 0-12 month vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was taken in the second year of life with the help of a combined Diphtheri-, tetanus, azellular Pertussis, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 cans of the present formulation of adults showed similar seroprotations and seropoconsion rates as for former formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is available both before and after resuspenalties at any external particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose Sophenylbutyrate is: • 450-600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and with both adults and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early deficiency of Carbamylphosphate or Ornithinly bamylase, the substitution of Cityslin or arginine is necessary in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a argininosuccynaynthetic lack must be arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with disturbances as a risk for the emergence of ecophagusulcera, if the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Every tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium severity and economising of incoming clinical trials should only be used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Given Metabolism and separation of sodium phenylbutyrat over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contra-indicated (see 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred in a 5 month old small-child with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacoate, which showed an intravenous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dossified neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylaculate is a metabolic active compound, conjugate with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is divorced through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Hidechiometrically seen phenol acetylglutamine (both couplings contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for deposition of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disruptions of the urine cycle can be assumed that the sodium phenylbutyrate between 0,12 and 0.15 g of acetylacetylamine nitrogen are produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early prematurely and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early symptoms of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was nearly always infill, and the disease lead himself in treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids, or with their silent analogue analogy within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, utilisation of alternative way to nitrogen oxide (sodium polyphenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium polyphenylacate), protein and possibly substitution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase the survival rate of neuropath in postpartal (however within the first life-month) diagnosed cases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy were the survival rate of 100%, but even in these patients the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients with many for mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Patients with a delayed form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotes form of ornithinly transmissible bamylase deficiency), which were treated permanently with sodium polyphenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet was 98%.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied to treat patients with acute coronary syndrome "(ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example, unstable Angina (a form of pain in breast basket with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without" ST- lifting "(an anomalous measuring value of the electrocardiac or an EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Angiox is applied to prevent blood clots in patients that undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with angina or cardiac arrhea to maintaining blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI option.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS with which the effect of angiox is in case of a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI) which was compared to conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anti-agulans) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was frequently used a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a closure) and they received additional drugs to prevent blood clots like Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - when preventing new events (deaths, cardiac cases or Revascularization) after 30 days or a year, as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox was the same as heparin, except for heavy blood vessels, with which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients that may possibly be sensitive against Bivalirudin, other cerudine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who had recently had a bloodung, as well as people with strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that angiox is in the treatment of ACS and a removable replacement for Heparin.</seg>

<seg id="2896">Safety and effectiveness of a certain bolus gift of angiox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, should take place a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT, the reconstituted and diluted drugs should be thoroughly administered intravenously before the application.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is determined correctly.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) in the abdominal wall, the upper thighs or the upper arm or was administered as a permanent source with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin at the blood of glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or insulin cannot be processed.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin distinguishes itself very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and shorter than a short-term human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was performed in the application in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body does not produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and enrolled 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, Apidra was tested in a study with 878 adults in a study of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the modification of the substance called glycosylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% at insulin lisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% of human-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra can not be used in patients who possibly are sensitive to insulin-insulin or one of the other parts, or in patients who have already suffer hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can be affected in the blood-glued levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for placing Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is either a subcutaneous injection either in the field of abdominal ceiling, addressing the thoscope or the delta use by continuous infusion in the field of abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced Glueogenesis capacity and reduced insulin changes the insulin need to be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Every change of efficiency, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, carcinating, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can move a change of the insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, can result in a hyperglycemia and a diabetic Ketoazide; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of patients to another insulin type or insulin should be carried out under stringent claims and may be necessary to change the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The point of switching of a hypoglycemia depends on the action profile of the used insulin, and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that can increase the blood glucose activity and increases the inclination to hypoglycheating enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disperoplycine, Fibrate, Fluoxetine, pentoxifylline, propoxyphs, proffylate and Sulfonamid antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathizers such as Betting lockers, Clonidine, Guanethidin and tipping the symptoms of adrying conspike should be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments on reproductive medicine showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humaninsulin regarding pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin is superfluous in human breast milk, but generally insulin doesn't occur in breast milk, nor is resorated by oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the unwanted substances listed in clinical trials, grouped according to system organs and ordered after declining frequency of their incidence (often: ≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000);</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-silence, cool and blasting, skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual bleeding or weakness, confusion, alterations, nausea, nausea, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is rafails to continuously change the injection point within the injection range, may occur in the sequence a lifebdystrophy of the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycheating pipes with consciousness can be given by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a doctor or by an intravenous gift of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a Glucose in a hospital the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause for the heavy hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose (especially through skeleton musculature and fat) as well as through the inhibitor of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that subcutaneous ga- and insulin delivery occurs faster and the efficiency time is shorter than hu- manem normal-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes, insinglulisin showed a vital ous metering range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg with a proportionally glued effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more, a proportional increase of the glued effect, exactly as human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice the fast work schedule as normal human insulin and scored the complete glued effect for about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was evident that at an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postptic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insinglulisin 2 minutes before meal was cooked, a better posterior control was reached as with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin 15 minutes after onset of meal, a comparable boycotic control is achieved like in human-insulin, which is given to 2 billion before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery at Gabe 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin, which was 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the meal was given (Figure 1A) and as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery at gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human Norismalinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
