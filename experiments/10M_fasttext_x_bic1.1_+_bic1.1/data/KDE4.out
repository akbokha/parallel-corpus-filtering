modern digital cameras feature the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera will then be realized as disk drive . the camera can also be realized as disk drives ( P@@ TP ) and deriv@@ atives . older cameras use under circumstances for connection the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ ous , the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ distribution software collection for digital cameras , which has been developed a constantly growing number of over 800 cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows you to transfer pictures from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . because photos in general are big files and transfers via the serial port are slow ; this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ ous ; supports this camera and performs the transmission of the pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras you will find under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photoelectric 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that the images can be read by some lib@@ g@@ photoelectric 2 camera versions , if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ ale 2 . if the EX@@ IF support can &apos;t be viewed if you could see anything else or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ plug ; is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plug@@ ins interface Project ( manual ) is a concept to develop a joint module for &amp; digi@@ ous ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ s . aim is to provide the modules of all graphic programs . the requirements for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost every way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is significantly easier , &amp; digi@@ ous ; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ ous came ; even complete .

what is a digital data management - away from the fashion word ? digital data management represent every part of the process that follows after the final edition and the permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , sc@@ anned or digital photos , does not make a form of digital data management . however , most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect and get photos again . we are looking for downloading , ren@@ ame , backup , backup , assign@@ able , optimize , wait , waiting and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital species management particip@@ ates in , inde@@ xed , sec@@ ts , being trans@@ duc@@ ted , conf@@ ected , conf@@ ection@@ ery and exported content which sells a month or cultural value .
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data from data . met@@ ad@@ ata are certified according to your definition data , providing information on or documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I decided to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need not to know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to save &amp; digi@@ ous ; . the approach to store met@@ ad@@ ata guarantees very fast sear@@ ches and secure archi@@ ving to you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need and know before you need to install anything in your system . you need to decide whether other access to your photos should be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether other access to your photos should be back or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to change sometime on a bigger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be quickly found about your location . if you have enough photos , you will use under@@ file such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; you will then publish a folder for images that you can print or publish on a web page .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files and you will not want to organ@@ ise your structure for this content .
what types of files are together ? the separation of file types makes pile processing easier . cut new from old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simpli@@ fies the backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived document .
we also recommend using the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the Settings page of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ ous ; this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forgot this , you can subsequently select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database in the files by using the corresponding item .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change ? to them make a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work starts , as you need to select all photo words , in@@ scriptions and a review . of course , you can then select all the images that the same attri@@ bute need and then set the value . that makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos when you want to concentrate on the best pictures .
let us now let us go with key@@ words , keywords , how you can use other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ onym@@ s for the same thing .
if you import catalog@@ ed pictures from another source of embedded words , then the picture will be put into the correct place for you . if the image of the Hier@@ archy is no problem and can easily be done by moving one under@@ tree to another . the imp@@ lied words are done by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while keeping the signatures .
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata exc@@ els . this is a very large representation , because each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data features properties of all pictures .
enough the words - the next section refers to in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ations or comments , the third important tool for your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you want to just see most of your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they &apos;re sure to how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from afar there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer look at some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this is the landing area of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the french Norman@@ die 60 years after landing . W@@ ow ! one starts to dream , memories , the historical period is back again , you may perhaps have changed your perception of this panoramic position completely .
for other photos consider the title may be more important than the picture themselves to generate a interest . if you have pictures , the key is to transfer it to the viewer , to help Him to help you understand what you understand what you understand .
it &apos;s okay , when an image is not perfect if it has only effect with a let@@ tering for themselves alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ous reviews , you can also use a lot of text , in an inter@@ national@@ ised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) . if you have exported your pictures in web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your requirements into the labelling and / or the title of web @-@ Gal@@ ery system . so you have to tell the story about the opening of a second time .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? it wasn &apos;t Earth not a bor@@ ing planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train de@@ parts of the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities of the Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation are already in@@ numer@@ able and are still deeper into the future . I can also use K@@ ML files that you can virtually open your trips through images with ge@@ ographic data . you can also view the pictures on the recording location . you can also export your trips to Gall@@ ery@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .

the following description tells you what information is done in the direction of &amp; digi@@ plug ; as information is deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for writer and Writ@@ er ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographer , for example , if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , then it cannot be changed . this field does not support commerci@@ ally nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a divi@@ den@@ ess .
Aut@@ oni@@ ze ( syn@@ onym for the editor ) : associated with the author . examples of this field contains the work number of photograph@@ ers . examples may be title as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a ver@@ mer@@ y that has to be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : do you use the bi@@ dder box to identify who the photo . if the photographer has been listed below Reuters or Associated Press , these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a warehouse photo , then here the group / agency does not offer the picture here .
it is very important the author and copyright chapters , although this does not provide protection against abuse . everyone who has no protection against abuse , can delete or change the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique for each image . it takes place in the near future , a module for stap@@ le processing .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire . these kind of losses are the same which can also happen with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics that causes a loss of data .
in order to tackle the problem of CDs / DVDs , these must be treated more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives that are longer getting more difficult and much more expensive . there are deals on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 that can claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . if you believe it is in your account room .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you are good dis@@ ks and good recording tools are not much more expensive than the cheapest one , but you write a lot more reliable than the cheapest one . it turns the right to select the right .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able for errors , even if you have just returned only . therefore , they use a control box mechanism to protect himself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the remainder we needed for the form@@ att@@ ing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
there is a reasonable program called I@@ so B@@ uster for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that corrupt data from damaged disk disks , disks , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything is said of course also available for the Blu @-@ ray Disk .
burn slowly with a good reception quality on top quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author license and then stored on a clean , dark dry and in animals protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that this media can read .
dis@@ course manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers guarantee a new disk , but not the data . Google introduces a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ failed .
shortly : dis@@ ks stay at the longest if you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In lower temperature results , the most frequent trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting , SM@@ ART cannot notice this error . some of SM@@ ART noted this error . some of SM@@ ART showed im@@ pending failure . this is especially Les@@ z@@ eh@@ ler and publishing count . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
here it is just about the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also save data loss due to a power loss before you have saved the files , but these losses are usually recovered without any major problems .
while most electric devices sho@@ cks not have a lot of power , that can cause severe damage on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed filters . these may cause severe damage , complete data loss , hardware difficulties , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from inev@@ itable to a loss of time and money .
most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a tool that is a part of the energi@@ zer which absor@@ bs and the rest is available . it is usually in the form of a plug @-@ strip . remember that not each plug @-@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that he also complies with UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it protects the protection against flashes , which protects the correctly connected devices .
since a voltage can use any cable to your computer , you should make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers offer over@@ voltage support which also includes a phone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modems and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ load protection . a variety of these devices are especially developed for not@@ eb@@ ooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus you are ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ voltage protection system protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of indisp@@ ens@@ able data . therefore , it may be meaning@@ ful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
beside the protection against over@@ l@@ ash@@ ings , these devices can automatically shut up your data when a power fail@@ ures . this gives you the ability to save the system . if you need a UPS Store , you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like a over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lif@@ esp@@ an of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your host system is exposed to and compare his security with electricity problems with the cost to avoid these . a high @-@ quality over@@ load protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you think about how well your machines should be used . at the end , you always remember to tr@@ ench all the cables before you drive to the holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; for Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is a further popular offer with which you can save any quantities of data .
however , compared to the hard drives , you are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is no general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online storage services . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your images in full resolution online . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should be reviewed in reality .
from the view of the data backup , web solutions are very secure . data errors are automatically included by the TCP protocols and for large companies in the offer a backup and a distribution memory . thus , they are deser@@ ted .
the diagram illustr@@ ate the elements of the transmission sequence in the calcul@@ ator . all transfers are due to transmission error . the file system fs and b@@ tr@@ fs make sure the data integrity between the operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody says when a transmission error occurred , not when it was in your hardware . all this dis@@ rup@@ tions remain un@@ pleasant to have no protection . no one seems to have been thought to have . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more secure data base than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they produce inter@@ ferences within data streams . in normal file systems this error remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems you should see in the future . as early as 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems appears to be one of two candidates . it &apos;s open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL un@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its bund@@ le file system . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms , and it is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
this is not under@@ estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % at work bench systems . in not@@ eb@@ ooks , the proportion of th@@ iev@@ es is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of the most . it leads to a less@@ er damage , such as theft or re@@ installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple user know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for long nobody has been sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less an@@ gling for data loss than propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . here you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the time during an operation is higher and a defin@@ itive status is avoided . if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the largest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits . commonly that the technology is further developed , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and space characteristic for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are very deterior@@ ated in the direction of 10 meg@@ apix@@ els . even though this resolution is rather deterior@@ ated for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ated . even DSLR cameras are ideal for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras are required for your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apix@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so , do not use any other data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a plan and test this backup before you do something serious like the re@@ installation of your operating system , replacing panels or the size of hard drives .
suppose you take your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then a day when lightning strikes you , you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a Des@@ aster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forgotten aircraft activity : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ iev@@ es are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or complete house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ ening always means a non local storage . bring your back@@ ups up into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above mentioned above is a common basis for a data loss despite secure the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without the history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : one backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the latest differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it can produce the original status at any time again . this backup occurs in a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it is only get@@ ed and not progress .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that allows you to set up easily on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer@@ ring scripts , remove only the difference of the files that really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
back important images directly after you have saved on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
this approach will allow you enough time to discover losses and restore again . at the same time you will get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment intake for at least one month and a moment of moment should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ MP files , original , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment ... , use of the Internet .
so valuable pictures survive the next 40 years , that is roughly the time period in which you are really interested in you because you remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable due to its nature , you must be careful and evaluate it all over time . unfortunately , there is no other option than a certain gest@@ ure . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself as the current system is back@@ wards compatible . the less variations are used in the past , so easier is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of detailed explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available today for anyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then store it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand the Council is quite simple : every@@ time you change your computer architecture , your memory and secure file format , you should review your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is to change a system in size for the possibility to change a system in its size . it actually has enlarge it .
let &apos;s go out that you have produced the scal@@ ability with the plan and the area you want to enlarge it on a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and locate it onto a new record :
check the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record was recognized by the system but do not hang it .
n = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ ps ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # changing the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no software you can read , then you can create these themselves . this task is simpler from year to year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . they should therefore no longer use it .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard , but it can be much more . it can be los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG may need a relative many administration information , but not as many as JPG requires and a slow compression mode . this format we would like to save you for saving your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( De@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , a problem is however that this format of many people can be adapted . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital negative file format is a licensed and open source file format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the need for the need of camera data . a hand@@ ful of camera manufacturers are already available , and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon also for some time .
this is probably one of the reasons why to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to insert their data into a file itself . the file information will be saved with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers drag it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , usually stores . X@@ MP will fit the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the file file and the image file can be used . therefore , you should remember whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Community Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation which support a wide range of purposes of purposes and business models . to the activities of D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and workshops , standard connections and expl@@ aining efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ at@@ s standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long the images on the camera ho@@ dium , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your resource archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine @-@ layer processing , you can use external programs . if you add the images back with &amp; digi@@ ous ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these have been cut by different programs .
protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code you in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photo in &amp; digi@@ ous ; in section add a photos to an album you can add a description , as you can already add on your hard disk , but the camera interface allows you to add many advanced settings for impor@@ ting images to your album .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect this with the calcul@@ ator , switch the camera to the display mode and switch them . another description can be found in the hand@@ book of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , the camera tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ el indicator appears at the lower end and the preview pictures of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc on the camera will appear .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about any entry . with the page features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a single entry or met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog displays the file features and the photo information that are internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not yet been downloaded on your computer . note that some digital cameras does not have any information available .
the rider Met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata like EX@@ IF , manufacturer of information , GPS etc . these information are the same as the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ous . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click to download and then download all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ ous ; . for downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures have been downloaded in a album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired settings using the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , use the button download and then choose selected from you until you have chosen some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is available for download . these pictures have been downloaded not yet from &amp; digi@@ ous ; in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you can download all download or download files , a dialog appears where you can select the target album which can be stored in the photos . see the list of exist@@ ent albums , like normal file , then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ous , you will load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you downloaded the desired photos you can delete them from the camera . you can only delete all at once , so you must select this first and delete them away from Del@@ ete .
note that there is no way you have deleted from the camera , the photos will not be deleted from the tr@@ ash@@ can of &amp; k@@ de ; they should be carefully checked , if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera . if you have downloaded the camera &apos;s screen , you should make it much faster than the camera screen , since it is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly meaning@@ ful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally util@@ ized after the photos of the camera have been deleted . this may be convenient , the date and time at which the picture was taken to integrate in the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ r@@ oring of the image and for date @-@ based subtitles . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options During the transmission will open three additional options that will be done before the photos on the plate are stored . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the EX@@ IF information into the IP@@ TC @-@ fields . with the last option you can correct date and time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % H : % M : % S . switch to the reading date and time . for further changes , you should read the command str@@ ing@@ time .
if you use the camera file names , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ ous system ; for a photo , will be displayed below the name indicating the camera in preview . your settings can be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window for the next time .
&amp; digi@@ ous materials ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to perform an automatic rotation during the inf@@ use . not all cameras are ready . in the section side bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can see further details , about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera didn &apos;t deliver this information , the photo in the original orientation . if you want the automatic turning off , use the button extension and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
when your camera takes information about the date , at which the photo was made available , you can download &amp; digi@@ al ; all images with the same date are loaded in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . in the section page bar met@@ a data you can consult which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you want to change this option , you will need to switch on this option . do not use the button based subtitles at the bottom end of the window .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to load photos from their computer to your camera is download . choose upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that can be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ ous ; you , where the pictures are up@@ loaded high . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select here the desired folder and press OK to upload the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a common term in this document . thus , a position is meant that can be displayed in linear and lat@@ itude and which can be displayed on a map . identi@@ fying the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photography , it can be interesting to connect a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to enter an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you don &apos;t forget to open the photo , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous user ; users want to locate the location of the photos so that you can easily document the position data of a photos .
the question is how the GPS data is in the image ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 are supported many GPS data fields , such as the data into these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the correct hardware , using the K@@ IP@@ I module on the ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and most recently about manual input from known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit integrated , but there is a few that works with GPS receivers . either as card module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with ps@@ cl@@ one or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel only . you need to store these data in the GP@@ X format , as it is the only format used by the ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ related data from pictures and GPS . on the following page , you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itud@@ inal or other data , you can use this script that works using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by P@@ hil Harv@@ ey . it uses the coordinates to be created e.g. from map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ google@@ .com shows no European street cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe .
digi@@ ous tests ; tried to give you much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that make the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ ous ; to change in the menu settings , you need to set up in eight pages . you can change between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
action can also be displayed on embedded preview or im@@ aging , so that the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ous occurs , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the column @-@ did@@ acy and copyright data . these data will be selected automatically in the respective IP@@ TC data fields when you are written for downloading from the camera body . also in case of a database @-@ pol@@ yn@@ chron@@ ous data , these data are written into the IP@@ TC @-@ fields .
Aut@@ or@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for editor : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this may be a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a closer description of the authority must be also filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author like this for a message agency , such as Reuters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or agency should be placed on the picture here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rock . this ensures that met@@ ad@@ ata are permanently included in the picture and not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ ous ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available and can be imported without lost without lost .
images added as a embedded labels ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments using the pictures embedded labels . attention : for pictures , which included in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ations , they are over@@ written by the party &apos;s shots .
the page settings contains all options for information which appear when the mouse rests on the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is indicated or not .

the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the visual brightness ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , if you have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode , if you have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode , you should only use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can receive a better visual results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this here . you can use the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ seas and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this picture mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that the pictures are encoded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia about more detailed explanation .
with the setting of PNG comp@@ ressing , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not decrease the image quality because PNG has a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression . thus , 1 : a low and 9 has a high compression .
with the option of TIFF files you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not have influence on image quality because the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is free .
with the setup loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , it can be free @-@ free . even if you &apos;ve been written the los@@ s@@ less setup , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JPEG . however , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ ous versions , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it was very fast on a tool to manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default value is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light as the pixel color of the CCD sensor . if you use this option , you solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option records a little soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic balance balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance , based on a white map which was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors , the use of the second sensors have the effect that shows more details in four steps more details in the fields . for other cameras this option is igno@@ red .
the standard is the top , so the parts of your camera are embedded in the settings , due to the in@@ ability of your camera , define a few f@@ ancy results because it shows the sp@@ elling in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . most recently , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the fields .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; fl@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red propor@@ tions of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a matter how colour or white you want .
if you want to re@@ construct the option , you will get the possibility to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each picture .
put the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . however , you probably need to set it somewhat higher than the default 1 . but this may also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; -@@ processing . to keep the time for the de@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should be preserved con@@ serv@@ atively .
a demo algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ filtered image sensor , which provides many cameras and which is known as a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
digi@@ ous , and fl@@ cra@@ w faces these three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like whether A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was the first algorithm created by D@@ c@@ w . however , it creates colour art@@ works on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you &apos;re looking for a quick solution with acceptable results .
if you know the colour tip of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you are done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back . there are also LC@@ MS and digi@@ plug ; information like the color space in the other to translate the colours as accurately as possible .
behavior questions , if a painting is opened in the image processing / colour management module with raw files .
download the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / home / user / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . check this folder then during the start of the start .
settings of ICC profiles You have the possibility to deposit &amp; quot ; standard feed ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your pictures color does not manage the whole screen .
the input profiles should be used to monitor camera manufacturers and model which included . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain d@@ cl@@ onal mapping or Gam@@ ma@@ ze correction . this means that you don &apos;t have to perform the ton@@ gs for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are further options like the soft @-@ pro@@ of @-@ profile , with which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer can have a smaller paint area than your camera and some colors . this could be done manually , instead of seeing the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious that the color profile is what is fore@@ seen for them . unfortunately , here is not a table of cameras and profiles fit here . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon pro@@ filing allows the style to recogn@@ ise the style : F for a precise style , L for Land@@ s@@ capes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plug@@ in interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; im@@ aging and image editing ; many modules support which are written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use , and these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main menu and additionally , you will find some also in the context menu of the menus .
short commands for tasks to be carried out by modules can be set manually in the menu under Settings short notice .
more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be downloaded via the K@@ IP@@ I project via ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ g@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the dip should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjust@@ s the time between the image transfer , normally they are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check boxes switch off the met@@ ad@@ ata that ends at the bottom end of the images during the display .
the camera features show on the left @-@ hand side a list of all the cameras supported on the right . if you want to use a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use it , make sure that the camera is properly coupled , switched on and in the image format . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have a USB@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage center . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / com@@ er , when you add your camera .
to support your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , and turn it into the display mode .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ ous ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can choose any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than a camera , you can insert all here .
with the option dialog for shi@@ fting &gt; images to the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when del@@ eting a photos in a album . in the ab@@ brevi@@ ation of a photos and del@@ etion of a album you can find more details .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down by &amp; digi@@ ous ; applied , if you apply the changes to the right side bar without any set@@ backs . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also attach the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ ous ; in order to start , this will accelerate the start process of &amp; digi@@ ous conditions .
the setup Bei@@ m starts to search for new photos and get the basis for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ ous albums ; if something has been removed from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ ous ; ask if it is to delete them from the database .
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous ; used to custom@@ ize the main window on your taste . these settings can choose from the tool@@ bar code . a preview of available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in making a new design for &amp; digi@@ ous systems , you will find further information about this tutorial .
the digi@@ ous work has a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and see the correction and improvement . image processing can be launched by a click with the left mouse button on the preview and selection of the entry menu entry / edit .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ous ; they are not part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules are available in the section of image processing .
a status line at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current date number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool bar for quick access to the most commonly required functions .
the machining functions of the image processing changes your photos . however , no of the functions will be used to save the original photo , before you select File Save or button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo , as soon as you have saved the picture .
so you should order a copy of your picture before you change it . you can save with file Save as possible .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image , restore the image processing button in the tool@@ bar . you lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last Save .
almost every action of the image processing can be rev@@ oked or re @-@ manufactured . the last action can be rev@@ oked , by clicking on the Reset , or restore editing from the menu .
if you &apos;re using this , you should make the short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to reverse and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you are using the &amp; L@@ MB over the rear or restore button in the tool bar , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu applications , all the actions are set between also on the reverse or re@@ produced .
once you have launched the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation boards in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image no@@ below or the entries in the menu file . if you made any changes in the current photo you will be asked if you want to back up .
you can simply enter the photo in the photo , in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the saf@@ er menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen Mode displays the photo in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want to use the Es@@ c button . normally , you will also change the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t want to change this inside the setting dialog of &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can call it from the &amp; digi@@ ous cloth . see this section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can print the image file and obtain the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole phr@@ ases . all picture pages can choose from your selection . you need only select the pictures with the default methods and choose from the menu album Ex@@ por@@ ter print assistant . if you follow the wi@@ z@@ ard you will need to make your choice .
the main window , main window , has a page bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation wall , also available in the image processing . it will be displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on :
multiple Click on the same riders lets the side@@ bar appear or van@@ ish into the edge .
in the labelling view , you can enter in@@ scriptions with unlimited size or add . note the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . that means all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated and special characters are converted to 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling system in other applications , please note these restrictions .
after you have commented on it either you have either the button user or simply change to the next image , the labels will then be stored .
in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can always be done if you choose a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written into the pictures .
the section shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ ting . it can always be used with a single click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard brevi@@ ations . to rate several pictures at the same time , choose this off and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC site , which follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word shows a search box for fil@@ tering the key@@ words , the key@@ word and a selection box with the previously made in this &amp; digi@@ ous ; -@@ session used key@@ words .
the key@@ word is adjusted dynam@@ ically to those given key@@ word . you can easily restri@@ ct the number of possibilities to search for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many words .
the input field at the lower end is another relief when entering the key@@ words at a picture series . if you have put different words , they are stored for fast access .
pass@@ words can be set in the tree by expl@@ oring the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all tags of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC site Key@@ word .
if several images are selected in the main screen and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , it &apos;s only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter .
the page bar key@@ word is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their record , - data , sample and view@@ port . if additionally one or more key@@ word filter is used from the right side , only the cutting quantity of these two are shown .
you can also pull them out and place them . if you have several pictures , you can move it with key@@ word . if the key@@ word is already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place on the selection . then a dialogue , you will ask if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the top example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is selected on one calendar . they were selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and afterwards a key@@ word from the right key@@ word was pulled onto the selection and put it there . a dialog will ask if this word is to be set .
this search for changes will be held at each start of the program . it can also be switched on by Settings .
if you have a rule with and created it and will notice that it would have one or to be , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and rules .
( 1 ) : the entry , after which is needed in the database , can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key word etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
you can choose e.g. a extended search over all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , just check the check box at the end of the rule and then to use the button group@@ s. see the options as follows :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this job . I was mainly adapted to &amp; digi@@ al . s specific implementation was adapted .
the reason why you can achieve a colored workflow from the colors or scanners , a predic@@ table deviation from the camera or scanners , you can achieve the colors on your monitor from your camera , or scanners , and those colors that you can print or publish your colour from your digital dark chamber .
if the theme comes on colour management , then everyone wants to press the buttons he has to press for the results . unfortunately , this tutorial is to provide you sufficient background information about color management . additionally , you will help to make your own inform@@ al decisions to make your own inform@@ al decisions so that you want to obtain the desired result .
if your image work@@ flows have been listed below all six criteria , then you don &apos;t need to worry about colour management .
they are calibr@@ ated on a monitor of the s@@ RGB @-@ color space . ( further information please see below )
your only other cap@@ tures are per e @-@ mail or the web , where the RGB of the de @-@ fac@@ to standard is standard .
so if the RGB works so well and the life for all so easy , why should I use another color space and do it to have thought about color photos ?
a visual example of the so@@ unding of s@@ RGB comparing to the colors that we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ en@@ is@@ en@@ ical region , and colors at the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB using some larger farms , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms page and click on info and then to information about RGB working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to kiss my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB color space , or not , you need to monitor your monitor so that you are looking at a color space by s@@ RGB . if you are working as a color space by s@@ RGB , you must use either your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard k@@ alli@@ gs , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve a picture in most cases . use it therefore before you try a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , ab@@ equal , Automatic and contrast turn from the menu automatically correct Automatic correc@@ ting automatically attempts to make the best . they are experim@@ enting with these effects , to see what works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize the leu@@ kin values beyond the entire picture so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its color sh@@ utter . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
ab@@ bot : this method adjust@@ s the light amplifier of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity is the same number of pixels . sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces just a very powerful operation , which causes either mar@@ vel at a picture or destroyed it .
automatic v@@ elling : this method maxim@@ izes colour range in red , green and blue channel . they determined the dark and bright bor@@ row shades and adjusted the red , green and blue can@@ als at the complete hist@@ ogram .
contra@@ sts : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by post@@ p@@ one the lowest and highest values of all values in between . this is only visible when balanced pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ous occurs ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white balance of a photos .
the white balance @-@ correction is slightly limited there via a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are able to perform far from the original image , if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your ways are to exp@@ ire better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm based by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ rom@@ as . you can rest@@ art it from the menu entry colors white balance sheet of the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side are adapted both the original picture as well as the preview of the target image . if you want to see dynam@@ ically the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original wh@@ it@@ ish , then it is enough to click the bottom window .
the preview of the finish photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right above , a hist@@ ogram is indicated that once you have changed a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in good illuminated pictures , most pixels will be very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on sh@@ adows , saturation and gamma . the sh@@ adows re@@ ills you to improve the shadow details of your photos or even down .
contact with the above @-@ mentioned controls , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then anywhere you to use the displayed color for calcul@@ ating the colour temperature of the white balance . on this type the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ load indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed . this will show the combined result in white balance . this is shown in preview as pure indicator and does not have a effect on the final image .
buttons Save as and store are precisely this . each setting of the white balance you have set to save this in a text file and load later .
the button settings sets all the filter values to its standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that the neutral settings can be obtained another photo as your original . if you want to save the original image your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the sheets per color channel of the revised image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the far widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high quality images . this coding requires also more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool will open the same dialog for the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . a detailed tutorial for the use of color profiles can draw the chapter colour management to rate .
another important tool is available in the menu under color images . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner must always do the same bug and you can always find the same correction . in the manual for sound correction , you will find further information .
a very powerful opportunity to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ plug ; tool Far@@ be@@ et provides you four color defects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ist@@ ing filter .
in times of the chemical processing , solar power , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , was a effect of the brigh@@ tly developed printing of a short ligh@@ tening . this was the effect that the brigh@@ ter zones dar@@ ed and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool was a partial negative image of the image . this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . an additional increase is finally reve@@ aling a negative image that is not to generate photo paper .
this is an example of the solar power effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a saturation guarantee that he makes a stronger contrast effect of the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , he emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a colored color film which is produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also some pictures of choice , especially those of barely landscapes , too much .
the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ps of the size of the Ne@@ on@@ light . at large pictures , the filter can use the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to adjust the colour mut@@ ations and lumin@@ osity of the photos in the menu . once you are pleased to view the different color paper . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the inver@@ ted problem . also in this case , the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice for saturation instead of them . all changes can be seen in preview . if they like the result you can confirm the changes to oo@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and simple cand@@ l@@ osity / contrast / Gamma is the tool for the improvement in the exposure of exposure . even if the dialog appears too complicated for this tool , you will need to clari@@ fy the application of the sli@@ der . concrete the three slides below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph@@ s of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph@@ s there are three slides in which are clicked in order to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the control is to post@@ p@@ one the controller and to make sure the picture changes .
on the right @-@ hand side the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated on the basis of the image , updated . on the left @-@ hand side are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis is represented . for pictures of a digital camera , the large areas of constant colour is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones , and the lowest for medium sounds , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three colour twe@@ ez@@ ers can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadow , middle and light tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two kno@@ bs that can be used here for the output values , such as the input values can be used , for example , to create an excellent picture as a background for something different in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button , the image values will be set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and loading : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and later re@@ loaded . Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you are using this mode and the three color@@ ings , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all sh@@ adows , funds and sun sound . adjust the colour box to set the text values for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option to display over@@ exposed pixels , all colour channels , to display over@@ exposed pixel and you can display the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on show the final result .
below is an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , and the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview is updated dynamic in dependence of your settings . on the right @-@ hand side are the following options available :
modification channel : this selection box allows the channel to be modified by the module :
in addition to this box , two symbols are to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera , the linear Mode generates a wide beam of constant colour . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps in this case .
for example , if you move a shor@@ tw@@ ist to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones are correspon@@ d@@ ingly correspon@@ d@@ ding and corresponding picture pixel dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marking . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to move the original value . create a point on this line and move it then , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and shop : with these buttons , you can exactly do this . each curve which you have produced can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p Kur@@ ven@@ format .
if you are using this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , central and sun sound . enable the colour pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option to display over@@ exposed pixels in order to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you will get the combined result . this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on show the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo , which was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun@@ shine was placed on the colour p@@ ette and applied on the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ ous membrane ; im@@ aging is a tool to improve the colour channels or change colour port@@ als of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour shades of the images . you can process it from the menu colors channel mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint as you can correct the relative distribution and impact . the left section of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be viewed as a comparison of your own riders .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you positioning this in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to view you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right at the bottom : regul@@ ators for red , green and construction allow you to retain the picture of brightness as well . if you use L@@ umin@@ ance , it is particularly convenient if you use the mon@@ och@@ rome device to generate great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , reducing the reduction of a color to a visible rob@@ ber that comes from a lim@@ bs which does not occur at the same place in the color channel and their rob@@ ber@@ y in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome converting in which you need to reduce the far@@ brau@@ schen .
the saving as and loading buttons are used in this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer .
the option to display over@@ exposed pixels , all colour channels , to display over@@ exposed pixel and you can display the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on show the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re@@ arranged . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography it is black / white one step step because color pictures can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film screen@@ shots .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good for all scenarios and fits very well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film projection with a orange l@@ entil filter . this improves landscapes , maritime and air photos . like the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter .
rotary filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar light to day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ Filter@@ .
yellow filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yel@@ filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium sounds while he adds a little cold in the s@@ add@@ ling . this is very similar to the process of a print and re@@ development in a se@@ pad . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
coupled with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool texture can apply to decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your picture , regardless if it &apos;s a colour image or not , you can look like an old artist , a pop @-@ portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for it .
relief : p@@ shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimensional stability of the texture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the picture below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the modified below ( 2 ) and the parameter relief is set to 200 .
a decorative frame can be added to the digi@@ plug ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to an image .
to keep the eye of an audience in the bound@@ aries of a photos is no easy task . to keep the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stri@@ zing eye . this is a psychological barrier for the stri@@ ker &apos;s eye . under picture frame the module can be launched from the image processing .
type : with this parameter set the desired frame type for your picture . penet@@ rates the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ p@@ ce twi@@ sted it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white pictures ) , it is ideal for a button @-@ scale effect and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with pattern .
the width of the frame is in percent . the value for the width is limited to 1 % to 50 % .
the finish line is bigger than the original but the same aspect ratio has . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool after side @-@ up .
with this practical tools , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture of any arbitr@@ ary place . this also runs on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with your mouse . use the larger image , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its features such as you need . at the end , you simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already the picture is finished .
any adjustment that you have chosen for your text can be changed when you press the button &quot; OK . after the picture has been saved , the text part of the picture can be changed . it can &apos;t be changed .
with the digi@@ plug ; tool Templates can apply a sten@@ cil to a picture .
the Menu image template in the image processing can be used to lay templates about a painting .
for the template there is no restrictions about the size and orientation . you need to add the PNG file format and you should add your template &apos;s file format . if you want to add your template &apos;s file format , you just send a email to the &amp; digi@@ ous database , just send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; digi@@ ous database .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your template folder with the button basis in the dialog . choose the folder where you have copied the templates for the next start .
after the root folder set for templates , a building view , which reflects the file structure of the sten@@ cil printer . the selection of a folder is updated automatically , the tool@@ bar of templates is automatically updated .
you can find three buttons with which you can modify the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this kno@@ b increases the lower picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this kno@@ b is resi@@ zed the opposite image . if you want to use the mouse to use the template . if you want to use the template onto the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
shift : use this button to post@@ p@@ one this button in front of the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template on your picture . the image will then be adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ ous materials ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but , particularly in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures .
im@@ pet@@ us mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture of visual acuity . indeed , it does not use psychological legitim@@ ate . you can use it to remove a really good job . the algorithm was made from Gim@@ p here and it is protected by Win@@ ston Chang .
the focus is probably the best of the three because he has really improved the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized pictures require a correction of the shar@@ p@@ ness . this is why sharp edges can be printed along with a common paint . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras need more then toler@@ able shar@@ p@@ ness as normal cameras for the private users .
in JPEG pictures , a camera has been used to create internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . pictures in the shell format must always be har@@ assed in the processing .
some scanner will apply a shar@@ p@@ ness filter already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this , you get your control over your picture .
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ alties . you can correct with the menu entry .
you should get carefully circum@@ vent because the results are not very natural : the shar@@ p@@ ness increase the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you can adjust it about the menu entry . in general , you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution that correct a little soft , is significantly easier than shar@@ pen drawing with the menu entry , and experim@@ enting with the settings . the preview window on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog displays you the effect on your photo .
the filter is extremely easy m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove sand@@ ing from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview can help the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often good results and should strengthen the effect . if you make the im@@ pulse mask to be strong , noise and the impression of grass in the proximity of sharp edges generate .
the radius looks like many pixels on each side of an edge through the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen photos at best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ per image one of the original is added , thereby the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the difference amount . it can therefore define a minimum difference to allow for an edge of filters with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore beauti@@ es @-@ errors are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined picture ( 2 ) . minor m@@ asked was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous point ; tool re@@ focus on an image by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copyright protected by Ernst Li@@ ppe with the copyright protected by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to get an image too &amp; quot ; rec@@ tified . this is better approach than just trying to try the photo . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Vienna filtration . it is usually achieved better results as sharp m@@ asked . you can start it from the menu by calling colors reproduci@@ ble in the image processing .
in practice , the circular circuit works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ unding . the G@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse has a very long tail , which leads far from the original source , which is far influenced by the original source , which is even very strong in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . the un@@ desirable results are caused by un@@ desirable results .
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular section . it is the most important parameters for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is extremely bl@@ ur@@ red , but then you should consider to a button .
correlation : an increase of correlation was used by the correlation . the correlation was chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the applied effect of the module .
pir@@ ate filter : an increase of the space filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 is only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is even further .
G@@ auss &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases , use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you use a value equal to zero , you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the rob@@ ber filters .
matter size : this value determin@@ es the size of the matrix matrix . an increase in the matrix size can be good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular shar@@ p@@ ness or the Gau@@ ge &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range from 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any refund parameter set you set to be saved for later and then can be loaded then .
try to perform all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that many surg@@ eries alter@@ ations are not visible immediately , but later the un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you can read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; when JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , extremely sharp m@@ ask@@ an produces better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by sharp m@@ asked a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it must have no sharp m@@ asked more arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the im@@ pulse . for the Vi@@ ennese filter it is possible to show that it is the best lens filters . the F@@ IR Vi@@ ennese filter is often better than the treatment of small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture :
this picture has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is attributable to in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the method@@ ology in digital photo , you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator must be dark@@ ened in the range of dark , in order to produce a more natural pup@@ il .
the tin@@ plate allows the adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want to adjust blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool aspect ratio is one of the most developed tool in order to remove the required arti@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the induction algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider Gl@@ ue and Advanced Settings .
details p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a smooth glass than the picture . for larger values , mainly homogen@@ ous regions gl@@ and and details can be sharp . please note that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be reas@@ on@@ ably ranked .
direction depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value sm@@ ooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value is near to 1 only in one direction . if you want to create a high @-@ wave pattern or CCD noise . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts are best eliminated at a value near from 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor via all@@ it@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , use this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : is there as often the algorithm run . usually 1 or 2 is out .
step forward as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle depen@@ den@@ ial integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , there should also be small for a long term . therefore , make sure that small angle should be a long time . you should therefore choose this value as much and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel gl@@ ass@@ ment and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the More to quality that you will receive by selecting this option is only small . it doubles the runtime . we recommend it to allow him to leave it .
buttons Save as and shop exactly this . each setting of image errors can now be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded later .
error correction is compar@@ atively very fast during work . but it can take very long and take a high CPU load after it . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button ab@@ brevi@@ ation .
below you can see how picture error correc@@ ts with little arti@@ facts . the module is used in a picture that has been used in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you see , there is an in@@ trin@@ si@@ ent black ar@@ te@@ facts in the fore@@ ground that is caused by a bad movie storage during the trip . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and this corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous production , noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool presents selected image filter available to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor cartridges from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ v ; -@@ effects of detected pictures from books or magazines .
if you need more information about digital cameras from digital cameras , you can read this tutorial on English in this tutorial .
the screenshot picture above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ins that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the bottom window details and the bottom window advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values increase the time the filters are needed , and the picture specified by the radius specified in it is smoo@@ ther and thus smaller mist@@ akes .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the shar@@ p@@ est level . this value reduces the pixel pitch of the filter to the front if it is increased . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filters can no longer get more and rob@@ ber or sm@@ elling .
edges : controls the edge accuracy of the filter . this value increases the response time of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or smoke sp@@ ikes can occur . set it up to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG @-@ arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either colour or lumin@@ ary to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process by the details settings .
color : controls the colour toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend either colour or lumin@@ ary to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process by the details settings .
gamma : controls the gamma rays of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dark areas , which typically are stronger , but also poll@@ uted the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing damp@@ ing . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is too high , the edges may occur if he is at a minimum , it can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges . he can remove smo@@ ked tips and is the recommended method .
store under and shop : these buttons are used precisely for it . all parameters for noise , which you have set , can be saved in the file system and later re@@ loaded .
this is an example of how space @-@ saving your life can change . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and this corrected using ( 2 ) and the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ py for your purpose . fortunately , use a little soft than a picture . use this tool to switch turn@@ out with the menu entry and experim@@ enting with the pane . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ous system ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photography file .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ desirable ar@@ te@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to dive suit , scrat@@ ches , compression and local bugs which cap@@ tures in digital , original or subsequent digit@@ alized pictures , to remove the same thing as it makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ turing . the texture rate is developed with another tool , the image error was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ay and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . it creates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons store as and store are precisely this . each setting of photo rest@@ ration can be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded later .
photo rest@@ ration is compar@@ atively very fast during work . but it can take very long and take a high CPU load after it . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can be restored as a photo with equ@@ ate noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film@@ maker on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and this corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures was applied to an old color photo taken with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts from scratch @-@ lighting and the photo paper . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and this corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous tool is hot@@ pixel of photos that have a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed too . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are particularly useful with high quality raw mode , because many cameras with JPEG compression has a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; .@@ quot ; light pixel rates ; on a picture with a dark image substr@@ ates . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel . they are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to discover the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD Def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching colour image to correct image . a automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the assistant will notice the last dark image and rest@@ art it in the next session .
the image range and the preview can help you correct within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are lifted in all situations areas .
choose a def@@ ective map to preview the def@@ ective pixels on preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate this pixel blocks . these are the available filters are :
Dur@@ ation : it is determined an average of the neigh@@ bors pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ectives in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from a pixel pitch will be pulled to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ tering method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to a pixel block are moved to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which then is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ ical surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which then is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures , used to see the original picture was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous document ; vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. , subject to a picture .
wide angle objective , in particular the entire sensor area is not evenly lit . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) it the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lens show this behaviour in circumstances .
but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle objective should also be able to use with Center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise un@@ conventional effects through movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ ming and colour and colour of digital cameras , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a cue filter to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ ite filter . the tool vig@@ net@@ ting correction is based on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three tra@@ ders you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further alignment of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light amplifiers at the point of the largest density filter . the default density is 2.0 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate a lens speed of 2 , ent@@ .@@ Increase the density to compens@@ ate a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting to compens@@ ate it by a little degree .
cand@@ y intensity , contrast and gamma settings : the processing of a picture with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the target with these options . the regulator do not require positive values , as you need to increase the settings only .
if you want a fine re@@ positioning of the refle@@ ctions of the target image , then let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ous sheet ; im@@ aging from the menu colour gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction on a painting . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . a correc@@ ting and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ous system ; Lin@@ ear distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . coloured distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree is the overall geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the picture .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar lap effect , but has applied to the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of coefficient correc@@ ts the distant corners to the second ridge . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated .
generally , this value controls the strength of the distortion second gra@@ des . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values of k@@ is@@ cated distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion . this value is stronger than in the edges as in the middle of the image . for most l@@ ent@@ ils , the &quot; corners parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value scale the image size and leads to the correction of first gra@@ des . negative values magni@@ fying the picture during positive the image .
bright : this value adjust@@ s magn@@ itude in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values are increased .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialogue with a preview the correction correction . the values you are using for your picture , are saved and used in the next start as standard values .
the tons or cold @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all the cutting and size changes . best if you want to re @-@ cut this correction as all first . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and afterwards carry out a t@@ ann@@ ular correction , the effect is apparent to the Fal@@ se .
to help you find the best correction to display this tool is a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea level or building screen , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in connection , you can correct the t@@ p / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic distortion with the help of the lines .
when you make a cold @-@ shaped distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can easily remove them with the cutting tool in the menu . remove them from the image processing or through the control kno@@ b of this dialog .
for most pictures the t@@ ann@@ ular correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings is the perspective for correct all angles in the image 90 degrees . be aware that when you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the tonn@@ age correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ enn@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see the URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with your mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview can be used to sim@@ ulate two parameters for film seeds and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO controller changes the amount of film seeds and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows will white as snow !
since the filter color duc@@ ts intended to produce an infrared film , particularly the green , makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos since colour documents are missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ free image from New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the movie was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a sort of am@@ ura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ ous form ; filter film @-@ grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for producing film seeds like e.g. the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of the films . mix the manufacturer of large silver tra@@ ys of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film effect of film effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past . if you want to get a tim@@ eless atmosphere in your everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ ined look especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ ms photos so you have to use this filter .
with the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the body , even though higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter repeatedly .
this is an example of the film effect based on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the worked film sensitivity complies with ISO @-@ 1600 .
the oil paintings , oil painting , produced the appearance of a oil painting . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous design ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting . natural images and styles are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ b to affect this effect . the upper elec@@ ts the brush size between one and five . thick brush is better suited for large pictures . smooth or read from the other side , the hin@@ ge .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the material is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth . 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous occurred ; filter charcoal drawing uses paint and inten@@ tions to create a carbon@@ es@@ k@@ iz@@ ze . the lines whose gra@@ dients are slow down , therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you have chosen what scene you might have chosen you to catch you .
there are two kno@@ bs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the charcoal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ous visu@@ alisation ; filter engraving the image in 3 @-@ D if it was stamped on wax . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous tool , filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with pictures featuring a simple structure where colour is not the most important in content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the picture into a grey , mon@@ tory landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contra@@ ction of fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the revised picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a regular photo into an artwork using distortion effect using distortion effect by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the picture in the cells and it will look like if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 is distor@@ ted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time for calcul@@ ating and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a regular photo into an art works using infinite effects . it uses protected protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom lens : wi@@ pes the picture along stone @-@ shaped lines run out from a centre . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ aging an zo@@ oming camera and thus produces a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radical im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image by rotating the pixels by rotating the im@@ it@@ ness of a turning camera .
range shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ ped the picture around the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to re@@ sign back in the background .
motion @-@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image with horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ pulse of a linear moving , z : B : a car or by train photograph@@ ing , camera .
soft@@ ness soft@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image sof@@ tened in the dark and strong in the light tones . this creates pictures with a dream and bright focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos or add a warm and sub@@ tle light bulb .
sh@@ ut@@ tered shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image by chance shift in pixel and sim@@ ulates the im@@ pulse of a arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : finds the p@@ add@@ ling pool in the picture and wi@@ ped it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the picture in rectangular cell and then created it by filling the col@@ t with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time for calcul@@ ating and cause high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops onto your picture . this makes it a natural look . it uses Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n by copyright protected algorithm .
dri@@ pping size allows to change the size of the drops . since the trop@@ ic size is not generated automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish balls changes the optical effect of drop in the picture .
you can start with the &amp; digi@@ ous process ; im@@ aging a range from rain@@ drops . use the tool bar to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area should be freely moved from rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the reg@@ rop@@ olis filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the worked picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photograph shows the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transformation Tur@@ ning or transform@@ ations mir@@ r@@ oring .
photo single bub@@ bles definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a picture at a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to smaller is simple . the big question is how you can find an image that can be seen or guess the bound@@ aries of the resolution ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can I see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here . try him and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size and enter the size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog box is below .
the tool for the size is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool for bub@@ bles .
many images of image programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . the under@@ lying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New Size and are listed below :
keep an aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original size is retained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
buttons Save as and store are used exactly . each entry for photo can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded later .
photo v@@ ases is very fast with what it makes , but it can take very long and take a high CPU load after it . you can break the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo v@@ ases by adding a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication as comparison .
the cutting of a photos is not just a common operation but also a common tool to summar@@ ize a photo . to make a photo you just need just the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pick up the rectangle , then you will see this rectangle while you move your mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut out . this allows you to pull a good overview like your photo . you can pull the size of the cutting surface by moving to the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle can be created by clicking with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the inc@@ ision , use the button Start button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tail@@ ored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or file Save as in the menu to save the newly selected photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rectangle by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain .
in the tool aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or trans@@ verse format . in the high format , always the larger value of height and in the lateral format is assigned .
the tool is based on an aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you use centimeters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons have been designed to automatically cent@@ red the selection by horizontal or vertical .
down in the dialog you can set with the Max . ratio in the area for cutting to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool is based on the aspect ratio , depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or vertical ) , when adding the trimm@@ ing tool , these settings are stored as standard values , depending on orientation , so that the EX@@ IF data are stored inside the image , and do not reflect the original image .
the settings of compositions support allow you to hide your images better . these are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles are to be harmon@@ ised in the diagonal to harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden middle : the golden middle is a pitch that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ ilus shell or the Bl@@ üt@@ ten@@ leaves of a flower trees . it dives in all the possible things to find out as beautiful .
the golden partition is the error number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you already used to create your temple and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you have your paintings , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number direc@@ ts from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i series 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the standing divider is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is usually follows as a visual harmon@@ ic .
the golden middle makes li@@ que@@ fied medical devices available when you merge an image . you are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photo . compared to the third party , the golden spiral pier@@ ced a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this kind of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called the golden ring . it should give something that the eye sees the center of composition . that can be a line of or different objects . that can be just as his eye can lead to the eye , it will fulfill his task .
the golden triangles also differ from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles do not have equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to this lines can be found on a static object .
if you use golden triangles to break your frame , you can create a effect of professional photography by dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your focal point at one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach any other .
the options horizontal and vertical mir@@ r@@ als can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the support lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . on this type you can custom@@ ize the color of your actual picture .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture , where things can be rotated at an angle . you can manually repair any video editing and tool @-@ free rotation . select the free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ p@@ angle . the values on this slide can be set in degrees . with the button settings , you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of turn is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right .
for your help , the module allows free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter to the picture to the two lines . after you fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture , you will find un@@ desirable three square holes in the corners . an opportunity to repair is the function trans@@ forming them from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is automatic . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option stops the picture a bit after the turn . however , note the above warning .
all per@@ spectral transform@@ ations are performed by a fixation point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your picture . you will then find some information which you will find here . on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog , you will find some information about changing the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new picture , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly cont@@ am@@ inated . for a individual adjustment , this effect is small but two adjustments generate a double as strong effect and you should avoid that if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes to the corners . one way to ber@@ some is the picture with transform@@ ations cut out of the image processing .
the mould tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite side . this is no rotation , the picture becomes distor@@ ted . with other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transformation loops .
sc@@ iss@@ ure your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press on default settings , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effectiveness will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview window .
to help you get a vertical and a horizontal line . move your mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the control tool to adjust your picture .
after which you have carried out the image , the picture becomes a bit wis@@ ely . for a single shot this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two proj@@ ections produce twice as much wi@@ per and so you should avoid this .
after gradu@@ ation , the image has tri@@ angular tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one possibility to eliminate this picture with transform@@ ations cut out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ous men ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats are therefore supported by your system and , in some cases , by the type like this libraries , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ous .
due to this dependence of the other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF ?
digi@@ ous files , displays only files in formats to the knows . this is done by the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is shown in the list , you may change the list of file extensions supported by the digi@@ ous list . in the section configuration you will find further information here .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select even the format files . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia , and supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression procedures to digital images . in this way , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smooth results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also be saved , if it is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the shell format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . in section configuration you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .

if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do good when the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adaptation with the module white balance .
a lot of tools that you need in the photo process are included in &amp; digi@@ ous ; included . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , turn@@ out , rough@@ ing , reverse contact , expres@@ sive , etc ; . use a uniform dialog box to preview the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below see &amp; quot ; texture Mini@@ den@@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bal@@ ances shows the status of the filter on the actual picture . to the left of him , five buttons allow the comparison mode of the current status to change . these modes are :
vertically split without duplic@@ ates . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected pane range .
horizontal parts without duplic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the range below the selected pane range .
vertically split . the left section shows the original and the right to the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and the lower to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the swing range and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch to expos@@ e to interference and expos@@ ing . the colors can be adjusted in the general installation site .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose a selection of preview . you can extract this frame with your mouse within the picture and click on the part of the image you want to see . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your standard values . all adjustment of the module can be noticed .
the page bar properties shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ expl@@ oring . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature . click C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this also sets the images G@@ eo data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . application can be used to edit arti@@ pal@@ ettes and to choose colors and using colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed from &amp; k@@ de ; can either be installed for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined colour and last used colors .
in the dialog range , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a colour .
it shows the color next to it . colour is described under the pallet view . here also the colour name can be changed .
he can also be used to elect . in order to produce such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then , move your mouse with an impressive left mouse button .
if the check box B@@ m cur@@ sor is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel on the cur@@ sor and write a different ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode allows you to over@@ write the check box under Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection such as described in the last section can be described as described in the last section , can be used along with the promotions , cut and insert .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a row @-@ end character , if you are three num@@ eric values in the cli@@ p@@ board , can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; inserted .
the colors in a pallet and the output of the colours can be pulled with the mouse .
a color somewhere on the screen and then select the color displays on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; Graph@@ s . Graph@@ s are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , particularly in computer science . so far there were no modern &amp; GUI ; program used in view of the program author &apos;s author &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program to replace .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; Graph@@ s . the &amp; graph programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( making a change of the graphic in &amp; Kate ; Graph@@ s is re@@ charged and in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; )
menu to open the Graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph viewers ; open in a &amp; Kate ; Compon@@ ent to open
load from large graph@@ s ( at present there are problems from around 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to present more than these k@@ not )
additional needed software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ ite ; program , which puts the &amp; graph ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graph@@ s . required in detail :
the main window shows the opened Graph@@ ene , each in its own window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; without an argument , the main window will open only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list re@@ opened files . click on the first icon to view the file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , a summary in the corner is displayed if Gra@@ ph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and r@@ under without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . down below you see the maximum reduction of a graphic .
when the straight in &amp; k@@ graph viewer : inv@@ aded file changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph shall be re@@ loaded or whether you want to ignore the change . if you want to ignore the change , you can also change your decision later , you can also set your choice later , you can also use the menu item Set@@ k@@ graph@@ s ; set up , see also .
if you open a graphic file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph ; -@@ instance ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph ; -@@ instance or to do the graphics in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change with the setup dialog .
when program launch , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last meeting again . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also set how the graph to be divided into several sides . the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be freely selected .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphite on one side will be igno@@ red on this page . if you specify the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graphics .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the page Er@@ ne@@ ut shop is the possibility to define the behaviour if a file has been changed on hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can ignore a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or change the changes every time ) .
the site opens the possibility to define the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; define if a graph outside of a current session is opened . you can open a standard behavior for this case ( graph@@ s in a new window or in a window of running the current session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the side seat management provides the possibility to define the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; define a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if required at each start .
the context menu , which normally appears in a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up more possibilities :
here you can choose from various &amp; graph algorith@@ ms ; select the entries as described in the website of &amp; graph vi@@ z ; :
dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or str@@ ati@@ fied represent@@ ations of al@@ lied graph@@ s . the algorithm lay@@ eth the same direction ( from top to bottom or left to right ) and then tries to produce short edges and as few edge over@@ laps .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for un@@ sh@@ ined graph@@ s . he produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ inter @-@ spring model . the cam@@ el @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a j@@ umping mat model layout . it uses the hus@@ band@@ man @-@ clean gold sleeve , and includes a multi@@ function timer for the treatment of large and geological graphics .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm calcul@@ ates the no@@ des of circular mentioned in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog box in which you can specify a layout command as a parameter , and the calculated layout of the graphics to st@@ d@@ out within the x@@ dot format . with such layout command you can specify &amp; eg ; showing the graph , or graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determin@@ es the type of graph@@ s ( stand or ung@@ ed ) , the default algorithm for the type of type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ divided graph@@ s ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module pictures are ready to read tools for converting new images and retri@@ eve them .
this module can be used to read and retri@@ eve new images of external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
images scan : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner which supported by the gentle project or another source like Video Stre@@ ams . so this will have to have co@@ oo@@ ka and san@@ e installed .
if you open the menu entry images , a dialog for which you can select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source of which you want to pick up the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by adding the given default values to select your image before you to read the image . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .

select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call up the menu . in order to run up a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data that were included in the same time as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded , automatic correlation was carried out in red . GPS data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
the maximum deviation for the maximum time deviation is a maximum deviation for the GPS time and camera time . the deviation of this is the maximum value of this is 2000 seconds .
if you have any trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the options of the inter@@ pol@@ o and difference in min. can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS is , you can set this limits here and make the kno@@ ck cor@@ related to the inter@@ pol@@ o .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog will need to use the coordinates from a call to the next page you need to use the OK button to set the data on the current photo .
location can also be found and placed on the displayed map and enlarge it . in addition , select the appropriate region and enlarge it . the height can always be selected manually , until you have to be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a set of images into a MPEG video in form of a dip .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length to convert . this module allows you to add a basic aspect ratio between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the di@@ ash@@ au .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically on the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can use a background color for the selected video format . with this module , it is possible to use the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD players . finally , using the Medi@@ ums you can only use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the pictures to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can start the module via ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images that are selected by you are listed in the portfolio by image files . there you can also change sor@@ ting images or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning the file on a TV , you need to set the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture . the speed of the image transfer is defined below . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast is very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and the path of the created file you can specify the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . if possible , keep the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify an audio file using the name of the audio source file , then you will need to start downloading the movie with the button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink quickly or in any quiet a coffee , when you &apos;re back again .

the printer assistant allows you to print several pictures on a sheet paper to print in standard photo sizes . this is also automatically open to the image processing Gim@@ p . this is partially useful to upgrade to you or to print it with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your files stored in the RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original feature by him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not to get the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you can get d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , choose the RAW file to be converted and run the module . the R@@ aw image Converter will then appear in mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values newly adjusted to optim@@ ise the converting process . the first option decides whether the camera settings can be adjusted for white , brightness and red / blue amplifiers . if the result is not optimal , you can process the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in the RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch does not effect .
once you are pleased with preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the converting results . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains identical and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged image format , TIFF , reserves all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W comp@@ ressing .
if you have pre @-@ edit your images , or later you should not use the JPEG format , as it &apos;s only a limited number of operations before the image quality are deterior@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to retain the original data .
if you choose JPEG formats , the met@@ ad@@ ata can be stored in the RAW file in the EX@@ IF file .
if you have adapted your settings with the upgrade button to start the conversion . if you want to break this process , you can stop using it .
the stack@@ ing processing mode allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode if you are safe , for example through testing a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you &apos;ve found here the possibility of exist@@ ent file automatically . this is helpful if they have been produced in an earlier attempt . however , a preview can be seen as far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images into an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix to set the start number and tim@@ est@@ amp .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a collection of image files . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can minim@@ ize the image or enlarge . in addition , four types of image changes are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image will be selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option to adapt to your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : non @-@ proportional representation in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
printing preparation : preparing the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , bound@@ ary size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the decisive pictures before . additional pictures can draw on the list of changing images and place there .
after you have launched the module , the images window will be displayed with you from the chosen pictures . you can add additional pictures through the button dialog for the last selected image . a preview of the selected image will be displayed on the right side .
you can also drag images to the picture list and place them here to add the list of the missing pictures .
the buttons images will be removed from the list of selected images from the list .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message with the OK button . you &apos;ll need to add the addresses and subject to the subject . you &apos;ll need to add the addresses and subject to the subject . the pictures are attached to you as an app@@ endix .
please make sure to send a lot of pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions for the size of sending e @-@ mails . there may be a good idea to send several messages when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the images for sending the images . your configuration will be stored and always uses up to change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird so you must specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you need to install the GM@@ ail@@ agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the election of comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images into a text file and added the mail .
the PNG format below the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats like TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you are using JPEG pictures , select the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the crucial pictures .
when the process is ready , the window will not automatically be closed , that you can view the status messages , on the search for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will start automatically at the end . with the button closure , you can build this window s@@ lie ? EN .

&amp; full studio album ; provides you two possibilities to create HTML pages with your pictures . the one is integrated in &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; integrated version described in &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; integrated version that you can create over the menu file HTML ... call .
before HTML pages have to be created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three sectors contents , layout and target . in the following will be more detailed .
first , enter the title of the transfer@@ ring and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on cd &apos;s album ; HTML example pages do you see an example of this settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook album ; export file is created , that can be seen on the over@@ view side . ferry information about export files can be found in .
last , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is displayed by a party . for example , that all pictures of one party are obvious . please note that all images are exported from a party . currently , you can not use this setting in order to conce@@ al certain pictures from particular mind .
in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most adjustment possibilities are clearly , why this is not especially been made .
at the bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the images . thus , those have to view your website and possess a monitor , which supports maximum resolution 800x600 ; for example , to download a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewing allows you to change the resolution at any time . it can thus be your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transfer rate , and if he wants to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting range , put the different folders and the URL to where your website is stored .
the best way , select a basic file for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you must select the main folder where all your pictures are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically adds to all future images . here you can select either a folder or one of K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check this really all for viewer . if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created , start this folder should be . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
in case that the HTML files created by you do not need to copy them in the final target folder , see , correctly , you must specify the final destination of files . this is not the sub@@ folder of current files , but the basic folder in which all sub @-@ folders are located .
the only possible adjustment options have moved all three to basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you set in the output folder .
if you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; you may want to add a HTML page to view the images . if you &apos;re already looking for a much time for this , you need to go with &amp; k@@ not@@ ing album ; this work is not yet to do this .
with &amp; k@@ not@@ ing album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ in file . you can import other files into your database . the image teams are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ in files , internal and external . they differ as if the pictures are stored in the file or if you have all the images into the file , that you may have all pictures put together and place this file as independent . however , the clear down@@ side is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file extension ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file sear@@ ches the pictures that are displayed in the file of .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found in the file of .@@ k@@ im file , the images are the URL that you have searched for the creation of HTML files . this is naturally only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML export .
in the following step , the dialog for Export Photos is described , which you can retri@@ eve over the menu file .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three selection options are available :
on the Manu@@ ally close to the .@@ k@@ in file , you have to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file .
with the option Autom@@ atically in the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ cd album ; the pictures will automatically copy for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG compressed and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not recommended to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress it , simply select the export file to comp@@ ress the export file .
the last option of this page is limit Maximum image size limit . if you would like to send your friends pictures , you may want to limit the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large . here you can say that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file using the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file impor@@ ting ... select &amp; k@@ cd album ; the exported database as described in described in described .
the assistant to the impor@@ ting consists of four steps . first you need to select what pictures you want to import , then in what folder you want to import the images .
it may be that you are called the category persons of imported file personnel ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is called for your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported into the category of imported file and which categories are to match these categories in your database .
in the fourth step , you can retri@@ eve the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . for example , click on the image .
it must be easy to browse pictures and watch images : if you look at pictures , you would often want to see images in different picture @-@ groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see images of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your boy@@ friend you might want to see all of the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this hand@@ book , you will find the various steps ( 1 ) fixed the information on your images via ( 2 ) to walk through ( 3 ) advanced themes and adjustment possibilities .
the photo album has been released as a program for managing your pictures . but it was expanded and today , it also car@@ es about images . in many places in this manual , there are more images , but frequently , this also includes videos with one .
&amp; full studio album ; records all of its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top of their images . this is a simple XML file , which you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S .
&amp; k@@ not@@ ing album ; re@@ members the folder where your pictures are stored and used this with future Star@@ ts automatically . if you would like to start a different database in &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; if you want to start a different file tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ not@@ ing album ; using the -@@ c option -@@ c ~ / company / index / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings k@@ not@@ album ; set up ... go to a window that you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ not@@ ing album ; in the following section of the user book you will be explained to the various adjustment options .
on the left you can see six different icons , with which you can use the options for viewing and viewing the options for viewing , which you can call through a button transfer to the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described to you as you can define various properties , such as people , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
on the dialog box is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog , you can set full member groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group of groups instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as stated in .
in view of the setting options , you can select the category list . with the above mentioned selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , a list with the current category and in the right is a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; full studio album ; spl@@ its the modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ s . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug @-@ in interface . click on the site of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called over the menu modules . they can not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook as they are sold separately . however , most modules have a help page that you can call over the modules itself .
since the modules are used together among several applications , it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; k@@ not@@ ing album ; therefore , you should always test new modules with the command &gt; button Album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu . don &apos;t say , I would not have warned .
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ not@@ ing album ; do not work . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; and other applications that are also using K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this kind of order not supported , it sim@@ ulates the order for some modules the order to albums , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ not@@ ing album .
sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ not@@ ice@@ &apos;s album ; the current album that just corresponds to the current view , so all the images that shows you the picture gallery .
besides the current album it has to be released &amp; k@@ not@@ ing album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ not@@ ing album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ not@@ ing album ; s browser can display the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry is a record for the module .
or this is the category that you have specified in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , if you are using the category persons , it will be possible to do so if you would have chosen persons to view and the module .
since some modules are with &amp; k@@ not@@ ing album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select the modules that are to be loaded .
on the picture you will see an example for a starting screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ not@@ ing album ; starting with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and a tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you can view the window that you will not have any information about your images . in the section we will not view this window , but now click on the entry images that shows you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; is the option to watch each picture with notes . these include information about the people appearing on the picture , where the picture can be shown individually or for a larger number of pictures , set simultaneously on all pictures of Jes@@ per , and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for Search and Brow@@ sen , as you can read in the section . if you want to see this remarks if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in the list , see three lists with a text field by using persons , places and words . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook album ; as you can always use it again when you enter more information on your pictures .
the following idea is to re@@ ject the pictures within the list : if you have a family party , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be shown , so that the used names are shi@@ fted upwards to find the persons faster and can be assigned .
if you prefer to get an ill@@ iter@@ ated list , click on the icon to sort by date in the list .
if you have chosen comments on any picture , you may wish to edit all the selected images and have these pictures with notes . click in this case simply to the front and back buttons , which are under the preview of the image right above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these images and menu item multiple entries at one time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California .
on the picture you see a browser window to display the USA as an over@@ group . to show you indicate that it is a special group , will be shown a special symbol .
in the context menu of the Rec@@ ogn@@ ition is it possible to add an entry to a existing or new or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also take an entry to this entry and place there , in order to make this entry into a sub@@ category . attention , this assumes that you are straight using your categories in alphabetical order .
you can move the individual elements of the relevant catalogue by post@@ p@@ one the l@@ ath , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by moving it out outside the window range .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs , click on the button options , click on the button options ... that provides you among others the opportunity to save the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can also finish a complete frame . if you want to get a complete end of this window , use the button options ... and then window will be a / off window . this process will see you in the picture .
if you select the entry images in browser , you will get an overview with views of the currently selected pictures , or all the images if you have no filter . for example , you can see the size of preview pictures , in simple to bottom drawing of mouse with the middle mouse button . try it simple .
when you plan an image on your desktop background , this picture will be set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this picture will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not opened any window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . choose the corresponding pictures you want to delete and choose either the remove button or choose from the menu menu . now , the window will be shown you can see in the picture .
&amp; Full Version ; provides you for this problem a solution . you can also use &amp; k@@ not@@ ing album ; namely images also , you need to record the pictures somewhere else , so that you can record the pictures somewhere in the database @-@ index . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ p album ; if not all necessary pictures of the disk can be loaded .
images of which the right corner is truncated if the right corner is not stored on the hard disk . for example , in the pictures 1 @-@ 9 , however , the preview pictures are present , so you can preview the preview of this pictures . you can also view this pictures with the picture viewer .
as you can see this function you need files from the folders and to copy it again . if you want to install files from files to the concerned CD . if you want to avoid p@@ aging your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all pictures .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , you can view the images that you may see for other in@@ accessible menu . alternatively , you can also see all images that can see your little sister , control and select the menu entry all out of current view .
with this you have set what pictures in the case of the F@@ everything should be hidden . if you want to lock the menu entry into your little sister , simply choose the menu entry , which you want to be locked . if you want to view the photos again , click on lock .
it is also possible to define a password which must be entered into the un@@ locking of the images . to set this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection is not very safe . for example , any one of them can read or delete your password as un@@ coded text , or delete this kind of password protection . this type of password protection is only intended to be those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ not@@ ches ; not very familiar with sight on private pictures .
the reason why you want all your images with &amp; k@@ not@@ ing album ; manage and spend hours over hours so that you want to look at some time . this is why you can view it sometime , using a picture _ and video viewer . you can preview it from the preview of how in described , start .
the viewer can see in view . it shows the image , but additional all information you can enter over the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can also configure this simple with your mouse and you can also configure what information can be displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . then appearing context menu , you can see below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on this page , see , matching entries to this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have several pictures of the viewer , you can change between them and return , by using the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as a dip album ; then invites you to press a new picture after a few seconds . how often a new picture will be checked by clicking the C@@ tr@@ l button and plus or minus and stopped by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability to change from &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; is it in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer is using the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch in full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer , you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us key , you can easily zoom out the Plus button in the middle of the image . showing how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zoom .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not drawn . with the same button , the zo@@ oming , so that every pixel is equal to the screen of a picture of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that can work with videos that are in and out @-@ zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ ar .
with the scripts from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can do notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at the picture you can see a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can open the view and configuration dialog for the image to enter these names . however , if you may preview only the image to mark and see further images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to start viewing with pictures and select it as good or bad , while you see one after another .
for the two examples above you will feature the opportunity to view images with features , while you are viewing this . features are the letters A @-@ Z and you can set a feature that you can press the corresponding letters . see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , you can view this in your browser . if you have selected all the images you can edit , print or whatever you have chosen , you can also use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview window . if you press categories in DR@@ E Vor@@ bis View , then you can add features to the pictures by clicking the letters for the feature , after the picture was chosen . this can see here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you are allowed to paint &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; on the picture .
the painted old will not be saved with the picture but in the database . you can reverse your pre @-@ old later on .
in order to see a painting on the screen has been painted on the screen . on the painting mode from &amp; k@@ not@@ ebook ; then select on the picture paint from the context menu . to finish the m@@ alen . simply select the cross in the tool@@ bar at the window at the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , you must have the use of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you do not need to rule completely , but documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should have read and understood .
in the property tree you can select individual objects . then , the properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire mod@@ el@@ - views .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all objects are already selected using the object .
to insert a new object in the object @-@ tree , select the position that you want to insert and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu Ins@@ ert menu .
if there are multiply possible positions , the following layout menu will end in order to choose the right position :
with delete either from the menu bar or edit menu or the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on to take these changes . if you have inv@@ alid values , a message is displayed with a error description . then you can view the input error , and again on users , or dis@@ card the changes .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; set user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object using help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 has already included the user documentation .
if you process a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the self @-@ economic view .
press on Pre@@ view in the self @-@ economic view and a small example of the scene will be selected with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is selected , even if you want to set a lower element . for example , if you want to set a texture in a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross the local texture .
the screenshot shows the camera points . you can drag the control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will disappear a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change shi@@ fts through pulling with the mouse within the entire window .
each item has a Vis@@ i@@ bility level . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the or@@ derly object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level small or equal to the visible value of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window line as default . the object tree and view of the object features are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can also store it anywhere . you can also store multiple shut@@ ters and just change between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the facade to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle below shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the summary on the right or left side of a view . the new view is then an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you would like to arrange more views of the views , drag the facade in the midst of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the Card cards in the Vi@@ ews .
the last possible window mapping are sh@@ atter@@ ing views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the view , click on the Desktop or click on the little left on top left arrow on the side@@ board bar .
to close a view , click on the little cross in the summary strip . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for any type of views . new views are woven , you can anchor them at any point .
the current window view can save you with view window mapping ... save . it will display a dialog where you can save the window mapping under an existing or new name .
if you have a scene , you can render them ren@@ dering . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3,@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed properly . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 not supported .
to render the present scene , click on the icon Ren@@ ders The Symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry in the menu .
a R@@ ender mode is equivalent to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s IN@@ I @-@ files . it determin@@ es the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add many end modes , from a fast preview to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or menu View , select the following dialog box :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but meaning@@ ful is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the card map size you can enter the width and height of the left picture . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box under section and enter the image cutting into the input fields .
in combination with quality , you can select the characteristics that are using &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this is from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ct@@ on lighting . an exhau@@ st@@ ive description of the reader features can be found in the us@@ and@@ buch ( &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; ) .
if a picture is controlled with only one ray per pixel , several errors can occur . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stu@@ ff@@ ing effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . in general photos can see pictures with this feature better .
if you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique means a super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is repeatedly refer@@ enced and adap@@ tive because each pixel is getting back again and adap@@ tive to the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray has chosen one ray per pixel . if the difference between color values will be adjusted to the specified pixels , both pixels will be calculated by a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the depth value on 4 , a gr@@ ating of 4x4 additional points will be charged with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) extra beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the cur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each . if the difference is equal to the specified threshold levels , the pixels will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , and the maximum depth of the records can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to be reduced effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn j@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ings is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use reflection rate will be calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this cardboard card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray is un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; choose the menu entry , select the menu entry file impor@@ ting ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is currently supported ; yet not the complete instruction volume of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when impor@@ ting error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window will show a list of all messages .
if you do not support sources in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ lust and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can extract objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source text of the object into the opened text file in the editor . just select objects in the editor and drag it into the slide tree .
with copying and insertion in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can also add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also available .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ dering . it is usually p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the self @-@ economic view , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set here the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example horizont@@ ally data ) into the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you purchase files , do not need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first folded file is used .
the color for wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the vision on the camera @-@ view and in the windows type identification number .
you can set the scope of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can adjust the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and scripts .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and a better sewing unit for the displayed objects , but require more time to Ren@@ dering . for some objects like the ball you can set the detail level for two directions .
if you cross travel proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection screen . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions from perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property yields better rap@@ proch@@ ement for the proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross wall , a wall behind the objects is illustrated . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a floor is folded down below the objects . the floor is displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you have check@@ able anti@@ ali@@ asing method , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ dering of scenes is used . the values for the depth and sw@@ elling value can be set . more specific indications concerning the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window , it is explained how to create and store Window .
the combination field Standard window mapping : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list Ex@@ t@@ apping window orders shows all existing window orders . you can add a new arrangement with the button and removing selected arrangement with the button Remove .
any sh@@ utter rules is identified by the names . the name must be clear and cannot be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the chosen window order . new views will be adding to the button with the button Remove removing the views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column create a new column on the right side of existing window , with un@@ lock the window under the existing window , with card card , you will not get a card view common with the previous view and does not create a separate window in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you would like to start with accurate knowledge of both programs . if you &apos;re going to create simple scene in all steps , you should very popular among beginners , very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should keep the following war@@ nings carefully before you compl@@ ain about a black screen . if you are using a 3D program for first time , you should note these important rules :
if you don &apos;t have any camera , no rules can be applied for ren@@ dering , as a result you get a black image .
if you add no light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have any error installed , you can see during the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , the following pre @-@ set window mapping :
take a little time to know the menus and using existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation that you can expect from that program you can expect from this program .
they are often using these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application must be noted .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and select the menu entry to Edit menu . thus , you have a scene without objects .
the wireless model view shows how the camera saw the whole scene that you generate . in particular , you can remember that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this is the result of the scene &apos;s reputation .
the object tree now includes a new entry containing the label camera . if they click on it , see the content of the view features , in which the different parameters of the camera will be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
change nothing at the basic settings of the camera , this is later sub@@ lines , but note that the camera can change to the camera with which you can change the target point of camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place .
if you press the button application or the input , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately accordingly to these settings . as a result , they see here the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could set for example a pe@@ ader ( insert body t@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an in@@ compreh@@ en@@ sible method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; actually , an easy way to use . you can use an infinite level as the ground :
a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button . in the object tree the new name will be shown immediately .
the open @-@ section view is also showing the level , even if at the moment , only as limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane extends from the horizon to the horizon .
if you see the object branch exactly , you will notice that you can see the entry for the ground . in this case you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , turn and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise one unit among the horizontal line , so you can get some of these parameters . choose shift and adjust the values as follows :
just choose the floor to hire its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little bit more .
in both cases a dialog for which you can select how the object is to be added . please choose the object . the pigment will change in the property tree . you can see the name in the self @-@ economic view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the just a matte black material , because you need to preview the look of materials at any time with a click on Pre@@ view . now , enter the colours for the pigment . also there are many ways , but now take the easiest way .
if you don &apos;t see any color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button users and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course you are not necessary to enter the color . here are other settings needed . in the color @-@ list , you need to enter two new attributes . then you can also do this record twice ( you can also do it more often , but the Schach@@ brett @-@ Far@@ ben@@ list can only be used with two colors ) :
select in the object @-@ tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object features :
this step should already be done simply , as you should have understood the basic work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball can be just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object features you can immediately modify the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button to press ) , so the sphere has suspended above the ground as you have moved the ground down to the bottom .
of course , the Ren@@ ders now gives a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface looks like a matte black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now arrange a material now . as already on the ground , give the ball a pigment in color :
first , choose the object and change the name to the example of a sphere of pigments . click the ball of pigments , then choose Settings and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve an interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the or press the input .
the Settings @-@ effect and reflection result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of them that offers you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; it &apos;s hop@@ efully you have learned as much as you can create nice scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a correc@@ tive method to produce a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ er from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) through each pixel by the objects , the visual effects of the sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects can be seen as the example Neb@@ ula . thus , the scene will work for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera you will see without a camera . without a light source you can also see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously each scene , that should be rendered , some ligh@@ ts@@ sources and at least one camera .
the usual file dialog can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have created before using &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ;
always open a new model , or create a new model , inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name , if you enter a new file , you need to enter a name and space .
presents the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been rejected since the last version .
you can only select this menu entry , if you don &apos;t have any stored modifications in the scene .
repeated the last updated command . this menu entry you can only select if you are working on the Reset .
stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can specify a name for a new arrangement or write an existing setup .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .

a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a possibility to prepare surfaces without rough surfaces without any hi@@ ves on the surface without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric forms which you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further mach@@ ined to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel base by using an image file as color chart .
sorry , is a comfortable image viewer and web browser . the application has a file browser that you can select photos to the display .
images can be displayed in either a separate window in the image of the image or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; hot show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can display using &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or key Return .
you can adjust if any image is displayed in a own window , or whether all images are always to use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , just type the first character of fil@@ en@@ ame in browser window . then a small input field is found in the right corner . when a matching disk is found , the input field is highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog setting - &amp; hot show ; there are five cartridge cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the work of &amp; anc@@ ill@@ fully for the browser and short commands for the browser , the key shor@@ tw@@ ards can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the pictures are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which can be set down below . default is not full screen mode .
if this point activ@@ ates &amp; ku@@ das ; already the next image in the file , while you still want to watch the actual picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a sli@@ deshow .
with this option , &amp; ku@@ dos show ; when sending the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; sum@@ ming show , this folder will be opened in browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . it is used in the window to fill the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color here .
you may be able to indicate that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option will upgrade the display window to the full screen for big images . this option is set to default .
specify whether the sli@@ deshow should start with the first picture in the folder or with the selected image .
the time interval between the changing changes in a sli@@ deshow . to change the value you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default value is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions . if this value is set to 0 , the Dias@@ how will be repeated as long as you enter from the user . to change the value you can use a new value to the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .

in the area exposure trans@@ formers you can select the color , which is displayed if the lower or super@@ se@@ duc@@ tile has been selected . under@@ floor should display the colours with what you should display , in contrast , a bright color and over@@ exposure should display a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show photo . has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view this page bar in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ é@@ ry ; is an application for scanning of images that won &apos;t make more images than scan and retri@@ eve images .
&amp; sk@@ é@@ ry ; is a simple application to scan and retri@@ eve images . &amp; sk@@ ip@@ ite ; can store a dialog for saving and retri@@ eve the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the pictures before storing .
you can check the status of your scanner on the soft project page by using the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projected / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ ren@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ é@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner using the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . stop and qu@@ it off .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ on ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) the options are not treated particularly .
in order to determine a picture , the user can only start a pre@@ f@@ can and then check for scanning area for the final scan . the advance can be started by the preview button .
to select the picture better , the user can zoom in the image and zoom out from the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom so that the complete preview can be done in the window .
when the picture was selected then the final image can be read from the scan button .
if In memory , a preview of preview can be selected in the settings , then the image is pressed in a preview window as below is displayed , then the image is saved and che@@ er@@ ly ? EN leads to a demol@@ ition and you will get back into the main window .
through the button settings the same named dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the important settings here .
the user can select the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview can &apos;t be desired , then the option must be chosen .
this setting allows you to select the way to select the images . dialog for storing each image opens the dialog before any saved image . if &amp; sk@@ é@@ on ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where images are stored in the Save without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , this folder will be used as standard for the saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a pre@@ fix for the automatically save images and is moreover the proposed name for the image in dialog for saving . the automatically stored picture gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string bag # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adapt to the saving used image quality . this value changes the compression value during saving . if select the image quality is not selected then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ é@@ ry ; -@@ Hand@@ book . the Knopf About starts the K@@ DE about -@@ Dialog box for &amp; sk@@ é@@ . . the kno@@ b features the dialog for Settings and Cl@@ ose can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ é@@ ry .

you may also establish an existing multimedia keys that they work as &amp; am@@ ok ; -@@ short commands . this allows you to perform your keyboard to &amp; n@@ arok ; control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly seen in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP @-@ functions from collection , context @-@ browser , playlist , playlist and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP function pause could look like &amp; z@@ B ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; Amar@@ ok also has some of its own command line options .
you should review the user a feedback if the script can not be performed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script whether all the required modules are available and use the dialog to make sure that the user does not run why a script does not run .
accompanying &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding V@@ 3.4 is ( for this script . &apos; command dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; call off
in the folder of scripts you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts , or simply converting them to the required functions . you will quickly notice that the letter of scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts are exchanged with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok &apos;s scripts . the easiest way is to use d@@ co@@ p ; which should cause each K@@ DE installation .
most scripts themselves enable execute of external programs and commands . for this purpose the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is relatively easy to be called . here an example in Python :
&amp; F@@ arok ; sends messages to all running scripts . this is why scripts were able to monitor their default account and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . to store the store and loading of the setup data , each script will take care of itself . if a script will be launched , Amar@@ ok goes to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change Sign@@ ates that a new piece is played . the script could now query &amp; z@@ B ; with D@@ COP functions further information about the new piece ( for example , met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volume change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ iz@@ u@@ cli@@ sts : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title , Cont@@ ains the path to the selected files of playlist , if a custom menu entry can also be used . to select one entry again , you can use the D@@ COP function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script &apos;s Not@@ ary Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Title ) to create an entry again . in order to add a entry again , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script &apos;s Not@@ ary Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; arok branches ; or if the user sends a script , sends &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal is SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. , for storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ah script management can also install script packages that can be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that can also be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , that the user can recognize the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; F@@ arok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the Extended Cat@@ amar@@ an script . for that reason you should name your script packages right right correctly .
the main sequence must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should be not exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file &apos;s rights :
if your script package is finished , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org , and link the link to the Wik@@ i script &apos;s side of &amp; n@@ arok ; for your entry on k@@ de apps you should use the category am@@ arok ; scripts .
&amp; F@@ arok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still very easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ arok ; you can easily go into the playlist , instead of need to dur@@ ate through endless menus . perhaps you are also looking for a completely certain title of thousands of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ ok ; &quot; s Colle@@ c@@ tual browser and the quick seek you will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you have already some re @-@ playlist , but you can never choose which you want to hear ? then , the playlist players are still difficult to choose , choose the dynamic mode and the smart playlist , automatically select the correct music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many gen@@ eric USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can also be used , such as you can listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - exactly the right to re @-@ see your music !

playlist to store , saves the current playlist automatically when sending &amp; am@@ arok ; check this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist if you don &apos;t want to lose .
relative paths for manual repe@@ aters : if you dis@@ able this setting , &amp; F@@ arok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files are stored .
the piece of updates reveals that the playlist window will rise / off , in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window range .
in the play change to context @-@ browser , automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the section of the background you can adapt &amp; am@@ arok ; s appearance . the section is sub@@ part in three parts .
in the font section , you can use the use of different scriptures in &amp; am@@ arok ; you can select scriptures for the following area : the playlist window , Player windows and context @-@ browser . press on select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection custom @-@ defined color scheme , you own your choice of choice and you can define your own color scheme . for this purpose , use it with the fourth color @-@ sel@@ ector for front and background color .
play at the start causes that &amp; am@@ arok ; after program start the playback will automatically continue with the piece on the site , with which it stopped at the final finish .
the window @-@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to connect the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can consider the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click on select the font from dialog box for the O@@ SD . the check box Shadow ensures that the text is displayed in the O@@ SD .
own colors are using the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color surfaces opens up the dialog for color selection . if inher@@ ent colors are not enabled , the default &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors are used .
the input field display text provides the text in the O@@ SD . by input of space , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . down below you will find a list of available rank@@ ings and what it mean .
the option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama @-@ users . you can define it on which screen a multi @-@ way monitor environment will appear to the O@@ SD .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers enable further adjustment options in this box card .
the Card card collection will be used for setting up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders that is to search for music files ; in order to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box in addition to its name . this section includes check boxes to insert , like with the selected folders .
under@@ ing a recur@@ sive issue : this causes that &amp; am@@ arok ; both the crossed and their sub @-@ folders can be found as well .
monitor changes : allowing &amp; am@@ arok ; to monitor the selected folders ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search will be carried out in order to make the necessary modifications to your collection .

&amp; F@@ arok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ B ; Linux ) . further information can be found in summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have c@@ deli@@ bs ( inclusive of them contained programs , because &amp; am@@ arok ; needs some of them to find such modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to determine c@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD , that your window managers will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . for example , we are trying to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use c@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can see this file by clicking on the Tag@@ li@@ b @-@ developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org and depend on the en@@ ut@@ te file , which causes the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly it is that day @-@ lib reading the met@@ a @-@ info from that file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b @-@ developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; branches ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; am@@ arok ; you can comp@@ ile libraries with the same compiler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ arok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , this would result to crash when working the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able to autom@@ ate . if in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the trace trace of trace to us by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) and if you send a good back@@ trace of trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is that many program files are writing as UTF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ file , but this is not as Unicode knowledge . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : M@@ pli@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ compli@@ b &apos;
&amp; F@@ arok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / Dynam@@ ic playlist ) is always active . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can fix the status disabled on grey and semi transparent . note that in some cases you need to click on a icon until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this bug : amar@@ oc@@ app : im@@ printed symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ Systems Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ .@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if using am@@ aro@@ K the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ il@@ amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any colored Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that am@@ aro@@ K may first find the correct version .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems require your Uni@@ x@@ or Linux distribution as well . you can also use help from other users or by developers . you can also use the forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net to the channel # am@@ arok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to seek help . please note there only one error if something is in the operation of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; n@@ arok ; only an empty re @-@ playlist . how can music then come into music ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the Start window is converted into the statistic window . you will find it under the ex@@ tras ad .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are available for the evaluation by the user while the score will be calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , you need to display the evaluation copy in the playlist . click here to set the rating column . click here to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
if you want to remove the files you would like to remove and press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then choose from playlist menu .
go a playlist with mouse into the playlist and let them fall there , just as you would like it with other files . just as simple is that : - )
in the playlist , directly next to the add @-@ button , the kno@@ b can be back . click here .
presumably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el &apos;s program is missing . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; Bur@@ arok ; newly . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ alizer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it on the menu bar under the ex@@ tras @-@ equ@@ alizer ....

G@@ Stre@@ amer may even add text and PNG code !
it may be ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux to be supplied in default no MP3 decoder ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , input

if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa -@@ S@@ ink , it needs multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously detect audio . this can be done by a sound card using hardware @-@ mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ LE ) or via the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem , and a solution . for g@@ amer you might need to specify a different sink ( such as oss@@ sink ) .
you do not just forget that media must first be de@@ coded . you can &apos;t just send a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is for most people , if you read a dec@@ or with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer &apos;s read the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control centre sound &amp; multimedia sound system . activate the sound server using highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ ity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure the main @-@ sw@@ amp SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs , which may cause hor@@ ror play . read this error report . read the sound of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ oun@@ dr@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts Driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimised for analy@@ zer ) or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less orders react to the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed but if I want to change to g@@ amer drivers , crash@@ es &amp; else ; why ?
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all the components . perform G@@ ST register to record all of the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the I@@ RC @-@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( complete am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg @-@ register , comp@@ ile and install it . then run G@@ ST file for all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now and fin@@ alize .

to establish the device under Settings ... Audio Output , set the device . typical is e.g. HW : 0 for the standard sound card and HW : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ oun@@ dr@@ c on a machine with an onboard onboard AC@@ 97 @-@ codec and a USB audio device :

&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ is@@ me ; : bur@@ ns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore it cho@@ oses &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore it cho@@ oses &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , it &apos;s automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , has achieved a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet , such programs are generally referred to as a Ripper .
OGG Vor@@ bis library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio coding and for handling audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : here is a high quality MPEG @-@ audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio @-@ layers layer I , layer II , and layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source codec for loss @-@ free audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ é@@ d@@ c , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : more libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files and then de@@ cryp@@ t them to an audio CD .
SO@@ x : a relief program that can convert between different audio formats and can be used . SO@@ x is used by the SO@@ x audio encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a functional scope fully equipped gasoline system for processing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . i.e. , for example , to create a mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without the nor@@ ms , can result in different recordings with the un@@ beautiful effect that can be played differently according to the music pieces .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : here is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to launch a CD and automatically play all videos stored in the basic folder of CD .
this is a convenient way to re @-@ opened projects recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . click on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked after a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
the current project records under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save under is displayed , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would like to save for each individual project file .
closes the current project . if a project has changed and not saved , ask &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after , what happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also break off and keep the project so open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will not ask for any stored project , which is supposed to be done so than would you have called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for every stored project is checked , what it should happen , as if you had called the file called .
when you call this entry , you can choose from the published dialogue files to adding the Project . that &apos;s the same effect when you pass the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a CD @-@ CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog for the Project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning process will only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can implement many proj@@ ections settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are written about what is that ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry is set only at a active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you are not used to import files from a previous meeting in the current session . this is useful if you don &apos;t use files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is thought for you rather than help to view the existing files and folders .
this entry is set only at a active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function illustrates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project will be removed . all other files remain in the project . this feature allows no files from the medium , it only ends the previously imported files .
opens the CD copy dialog . this also allows you to create a CD onto a different medium . alternatively , you can only burn only a copy of a CD instead of normal copy . you should also suggest cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ectives or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also use a DVD with the help of copying dialog . also , it is also possible to convert the goal medium to be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . thus you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , which will be completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between the typ@@ ology of writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously produced CD image . the dialog asks for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can then be burnt immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously produced DVD image . the dialog asks for a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which can then be burnt immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously drawn DVD video can be converted . this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anyway . it contains information about the le@@ aded video , coding settings and even possibilities to changing the size and cutting black edges .
shows information on the pic@@ kl@@ ed media . these information will be displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of the tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a little l@@ ath at the bottom edge of the window is indicated . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if it is not crossed , the status bar will be blo@@ ated .
will the folder view shows a or out . the folder view contains an overview of your files and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with functions such as media info , lock and un@@ lock the disk or throw out the medium .
if the content view is activated or out . the content view allows selecting and pulling files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was chosen with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view .
if the head @-@ bar is in the project view or out . the head point is a nar@@ rower range that contains only visible even if the projection view comes open projects . the cop@@ fl@@ ax has no real function , it looks pretty reve@@ aling and separates the projection view from the rest of the views .
this will open a dialog window for changing the key assign@@ ments for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . after you choose one of the available commands at the upper part , you can adjust the key rules for this further below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . with this you can set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . system administrator rights are required , therefore you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b opens . here you can operate general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on h@@ ie@@ b . this dialog is intended for personnel and tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled by a sh@@ ell@@ tran@@ script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions , you can either use the program d@@ co@@ p program or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , therefore , it is rather the taste and the way of your task is crucial to which the change programs you enter .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make use &amp; D@@ COP ; you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; started . then give something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program , supporting &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two further parts that are described below .
the default D@@ COP @-@ interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features such as cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD and further functions for creating new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a project via the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project due to this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b features the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface which is applicable only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folder :

&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; can be read for &amp; k@@ de ; with it all easy audio CD ; s can be read and saved in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on your computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( compressed file data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ ers who are encoded using this WAV files ( this co@@ aster pack@@ ets are not yet installed from the Linux distribution ) . more co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of &amp; CD ; read and read in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( normally one per titles ) comp@@ resses to the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must now be done .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre@@ bis ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ ders are already present , so it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile anything yourself . but if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not necessary .
what encoding / file format should be used ? the Chap@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction by co@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this program is not intended to read any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD instrument can handle the protection . in every case it can handle &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; even avoid the mechanisms of copying protection . avoid simply the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once must be done ( the setup dialog can often be called up to a suitable configuration ) , then the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD ; this is ( hop@@ efully ) to understanding for the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which co@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can pick &amp; CD information from the fre@@ ed@@ b of the internet or work completely without network , with all that is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . on the page step by step example you will find further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the register maps for the configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB will be on request to the CD data according to the setup of CD@@ DB . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case must first be made the connection to the Internet . )
to start reading and - when an encoder was configured in the registry settings , the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so the choice with another encoder is read as default . it is too aware that before the encoder was configured in the setup dialog for setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that a file up@@ loaded file will be selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code it .
opens the dialog for configur@@ ing the messages ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ort ) for programming events ( as read the &amp; CD ; closed ) .
opens the main building dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with various cards ( such as Encoder , for setting up the en@@ co@@ ders ) . here you must go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you to choose the right body .
if no audio information is supposed to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are other such as &apos; hormone &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may possibly be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats which lose data through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG mag today have a light advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above that bit@@ rate the differences are much less important because both Ko@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , but only with most distri@@ butions are supplied free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( for high bit@@ rates ) but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with deeper bitter@@ ness .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG form@@ ators are present .
MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters to audio quality and resulting from results for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ prec@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ prec@@ set Standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people with acceptable transparency and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi system with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ prec@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 @-@ 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi system with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ prec@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of one title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi system with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good enjo@@ yment for music by yo@@ ungst@@ ers , portable devices and car cereals , but not good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ prec@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most of the environments we want to have the absolutely highest quality , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are entered manually or by the program will automatically be brought from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the Ko@@ di@@ ver program for the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ ver programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the body and these parameters here . the manual or help to the Ko@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ words ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s must be encoded with l@@ ame , the switch @-@ d@@ d must be added of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the result looks like that : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters to be used ( = button designation in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database in which people can read / enter the information up / write that all other these information can be downloaded instead of herself in the calcul@@ ator . it &apos;s too aware that here only from text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , N@@ ames of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( indication of the translation ) I am not At@@ tor@@ ney . however , no one prevent the information without the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so can neither the artist nor the music business damage can be added . all information can be obtained from a B@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; shop , physically or virtually .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is active a check box ( sending an address ) . in this kind of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the data from server ( This may only know the programmer who has reviewed the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator is used , the geograph@@ ically on the next door is used , this saves bandwidth on the network and equ@@ ates the load between the machines .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org provides a recent list of mirror ser@@ ver@@ n for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during out@@ going a &amp; CD ; alternatively the entire database can be downloaded or ( generally issued monthly ) just the updates of database .
what is the read program is used to store pieces from CD &amp; CD ; WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ored that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to look at the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see Note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the matching distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done .
to save the file format WAV files can be selected and thus the required file format can be selected . during the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added on the Registration tab . other co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the co@@ axial package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the code can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined turn@@ di@@ ers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapters of the Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ ver can be received further information on its switch as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ ver .
this can have many causes . check out the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD lear@@ ns , write and read what both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio co@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give a hint that is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the she@@ ath of &amp; CD ; this will not be joint !
there is a chapter with step by step example . even if you use other settings , these tips can give you how to proceed .
did you read the complete manual , everything understood , but they are still uns@@ af@@ e what to do . now , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that you want to do what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , everything setup and our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll be able to use MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ words ( tags ) .
you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution as an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found , as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile source files whatever you can always do .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd is that you own write permission ( eg ; to copy anything using the quer@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something which is thought only once done and
the second section describes the preview for reading a &amp; CD ; what to be repeated for each ex@@ tras &amp; CD .
here we determine the use of encoding for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ prec@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . because we are la@@ zy to use the program that use fre@@ ed@@ b to use the &amp; CD ; download data from the internet .
even though we can change these settings at any time , we are very likely to change it with any &amp; CD if once the matching settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the read program that it can read / CD data / pieces .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your running process . if it is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be accessed , so you can get a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM , and / or DVD drives .
the card ticket General settings . here you can &apos;t do much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be shown as shown in screen photo .
only in case of incomplete information , so that you may be informed when informations to the witnesses of sample words ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD , settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and let &apos;s download the &amp; CD . data automatically download the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading &amp; CD @-@ ROM , so that it can access the free server on the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , will start immediately the reading &amp; CD . this is with low risk if you are later wrong with the database entry and the date / file names cannot be changed using con@@ qu@@ or - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter all manually , check the database fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used in offline mode . however , this is over 620 MB big , the two cho@@ ices must be selected in offline mode , at least the two cho@@ ices must be selected , at least the first card card is set up .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data subject to retri@@ eve &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server on the Internet . how does the system get what data can get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in screen photo .
mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we want to work on the Internet server using the remote database .
CD@@ DB Server : please go to page free of fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org and look after a mirror server in your proximity . on this path , the load is distributed among the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both will work equivalent to the server , but there are many Fire@@ walls the protocol 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly , there is maybe more happiness with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example , we want no &amp; CD ; collect data on the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be enough .
simply apply the settings from screen photograph . ( make sure the folder / tmp is found on your computer )
number of simultaneous tracks : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parall@@ eled reading and en@@ code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try .
CD ; to check out the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD at the end of the trial .
custom file for temporary files : if you check out this file , then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored . this can &apos;t be useful if only place on another drive . don &apos;t forget to make this folder when you want to do something with the WAV files .
all in this way , as it is on screen photo . the command is slightly long , under circumstances it must be sc@@ anned anything to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ prec@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good stereo sound quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting rate bit rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of creating tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags can also be deleted as required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later modification of the input ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside these sample :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
this is , we just completed the basic facility of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD . if you have chosen the organization &apos;s structure to smart , you will never need to change it again .
in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD . we will create MP3 files . the file structure is described as described in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section has to be repeated for each ex@@ tras &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is still not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , see the screen photos a bit different from considered for a &amp; CD ; with successfully obtained from fre@@ ed@@ b , you &apos;ll also learn the CD ; data manually insert it instead of the Internet . comments are available on the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not yet to happen , then the &amp; CD must now be defined in the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in window , just as in screen photo . this only if the CD @-@ CD could be identified as an audio CD ; it could be identified and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia can be identified .
if this is not happening , you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
note : if the &amp; CD can be collected from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are completed , then the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the case that there is more than a entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key to your &amp; CD ; there will be a window built , and you can select the database entry , which fits best to your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the check box for the automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also send it manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , you will need to connect the data to the Internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; actu@@ ator title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist does not have to be entered into the login field &quot; Update title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ a@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments using the CD together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to verify the contents of the CD @-@ editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with case letters start or not ... ) , but also to verify whether there are any un@@ wanted remarks .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags that are limited to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the comment area . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set up unlimited field length , at least on the field card Ko@@ di@@ er@@ aser settings ; take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ ders or file formats . see the help for Ko@@ di@@ erer in order to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obvious in the style of the trigger @-@ based CD ; this example is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data so@@ ed@@ .@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap to be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ editor will be back and you &apos;ll see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data which we have for the first piece . simply specify the entries for the fields of the current denom@@ ination . give the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and click the same way until you have entered all the title page of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is sorted into one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected , or out . a simple click on the line switches to select all the pieces , or select all the pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all the pieces at once .
when clicking on the button selection selected by clicking on the button selection , this window appears for confirmation . click OK then and then we &apos;ll see a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the rider assignment to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message you can , if you &apos;re trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer , which you have not yet installed . items which have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example . did you checked if you have a writing to the folder for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it &apos;s clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece of it , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 to the format MP3 . thus , read and en@@ code parallel . please note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setup to supp@@ ress and en@@ code this behavior , the number of parallel operation is the result un@@ clear . the calcul@@ ator used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have any problem when simultaneous and en@@ code ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order in the waiting time of the body is coded . after the last piece is encoded , a small window will be de@@ coded with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ revised resp . 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; it is currently talking within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the ple@@ bis@@ media package . if you are using CV@@ S , you can already download an anonymous package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package deals on your distribution . if you read this , you probably have done it ...
this section is addressed to persons , compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled packet of their distribution .
if you are searching for using your needs , if it runs once , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations on settings . read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it displays screen photos of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
Hi , always on reading ? even if only the help menu click on the first start of the program , without any point of view , it should be left somehow from this somehow left screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; on the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
why go this ? if you read this , probably the program has started . it should look like something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t stop this hand@@ book . it is considered the first version for a manual at &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; let it do . at least , after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has given this section and is therefore agree with this suggest@@ ion .
strange , if you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others he did not have some properties that do not have other &amp; UNIX ; MIDI players with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ mid ; support also support &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver supported for G@@ us cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ enz@@ er .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the song text on the screen with changing color , so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel through high@@ lighting of the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; @-@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to drag .
supports the existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( rec@@ itals or text events ) . K@@ Mid was automatically the procedures used .
to finish . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during the playing of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you select the desired song .
you can also send a file from a &amp; @-@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window fall . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open and put the kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar , select the entry you play from the menu piece , or store the places .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played in succession . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid , a piece of play , you can jump on any spot by using the medium mouse button and drive along with the kno@@ b and drive away .
if you find that a song can play back quickly or too slowly , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the template &apos;s speed , and then click the play@@ speed . to get back the original pace , double click on the template .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the kno@@ b is a pressure on the button stop or the selecting the menu entry into the menu , so the playback is played , while playing the place , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playing the playback .
lyrics can be saved on two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use Tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nis , others use song event and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are supposed to be displayed , and even better : the event of the event is automatically determined , so that you can manually set the kar@@ aoke text from the menu settings . you still have the option to change that if you want to see the other type .
if you want to adjust a reminder type , choose from the menu settings the entries text and song events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summar@@ ise . these are played by the series . in this section , how you can use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click here to New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the files in the collection .
into the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be stored . consider that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button . it appears again the file dialog where you can select the song &apos;s song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setup of automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is activated , a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using file or drag &amp; drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and yellow . this collection will then be added to the opening pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the song and then click on removing .
you can choose the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub @-@ menu sequence sequence of the menu collections , songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be renewed .
to play a song , select it from the collection manager or use the selection list on the kar@@ aoke text .
to ski@@ p another song , select the Next song , the entry next song from the menu , or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the button prior to the previous piece , select the previous piece from the menu or press the button on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection , and click on the button Del@@ ete .
the temporary data may not be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter because they are not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ izers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map which converts all events of type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ us cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file of your hand ( using your favorite password ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary modifications to play a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP -@@ section that can appear so often as desired . but for that each appearance has a different text ( see below ) .
define P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP , &quot; name of the key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D define CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you see that it is necessary to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map file as an e @-@ mail , so I can do in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section is specified as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the sign is igno@@ red . it is believed that the GM should be in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you cannot change the order and do not deal any line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to place all sounds that need this instrument to place the tone with the number M . if your keyboard supports no tissue ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which allows you to gain a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a tissue shot . for this purpose , apply the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP -@@ section :
for example , if an MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( ri@@ pping ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch included in the patch , each tone is a different per@@ cus@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , basin , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not that , in which the sound is the pitch of the same drum means that it means some keyboards .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument . use :
as in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP -@@ section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several con@@ es for each channel and instrument each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Ke@@ ym@@ k@@ aps are used mostly to form tones to the percussion channel . take a look at the supplied Ke@@ ym@@ k@@ aps .
this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , make it very easy in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP -@@ section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built after the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , you need to use the key@@ map with the name name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will ignore the patch on this channel . in this case , it will always be used for patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the per@@ cus@@ sions patch on the per@@ imeter channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ ratio indicates in which the ratio of pitch detection is multiplied by the value n , this is equivalent to the value n * ( r / 4096 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 4096 is used , so that the map file does not have dec@@ imal dec@@ imal .
this setting is needed , because GM provides that a keyboard , which is to play a sound higher with the value 4096 , to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some keyboards up to one octave is higher to play . to try out the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit of &amp; k@@ mid ; trying to try out .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole set of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard , you can see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . if you have changed a instrument , the kno@@ b is not longer green but red , to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to view the played tones . you choose the menu settings under the point channel view : settings
the speed display shows the speed that is played with a song . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you can find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow down . to change the pace , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a music piece . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can get rid , &amp; k@@ mid ; but use a similar sound quality . however , a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and a good syn@@ thesizer . in addition to a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have the control over all .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid . that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support has been compiled . to eliminate the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I have no desire to add all files individually .
agree , therefore it supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , choose all files from , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
in advance , activate the setup Automatic Add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary data collection .
you can switch the arrow button to the left from Tem@@ po@@ unding LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default temp@@ o , you can click on the LCD double click .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; @-@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way , if I want to play a MIDI file ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file , just change to the &amp; kon@@ cross ; -@@ window and select the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to listen to a file only if you want to add a file , without a collection , turn the setup Automatic adding to the collection , and the new file format will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d . so you only want to play the first file . so set the setup Automatic adding to the collection and open your temporary data , then it contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then un@@ lock the B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid play and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or I see postcard , this people will anim@@ ate me on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .

&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used for playing video files from the mp3 player or phon@@ on formats , as well as to playback DVD , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; on this machine was installed .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new releases , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mail list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ oo windows . there is always the window with the central view . and finally there is an information window , which is only displayed if information is displayed in it .
it is possible to set the preferred connections under the menu . but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that will be played after each other , you should use the category Dur@@ able playlist .
of course you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ apostle . if you were an entry , his group and all his sub@@ sets are copied to the current category and playback begins with the requested entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and Dau@@ re@@ ty playlist can also be changed through a direct editing , but also by applying itself . for example , the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / , can also choose from the menu click , and next processing mode . by clicking on a sub@@ group , the XML content is displayed only .
after changing XML files , you must choose from the menu to the same with playlist and choose either the processing mode , or select a different category .
all changes are lost when processing mode is left or another group is selected without leaving the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can be turned on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation when starting and sending can be disabled through the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c and changing &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can simply be inserted .
it is also possible to activate any other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / Ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml should be aware that format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at start does not need to be short , it will be automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be anno@@ ying at the end @-@ animation but the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a Start animation may be the advertisement of a favorite photos ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G procedure = &quot; in@@ defin@@ ite &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; Me@@ et ; / w ; / sm@@ il@@ d ; In directory testing of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported in the directory testing / some examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player .
there is a riders on configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the player from the player and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of multi@@ player .
there is no riders for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module of sw@@ apping @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can even be played . it can even be inserted the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in playlist XML .
to restore the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service providers for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash is specified in the setup dialog for assign@@ ments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is found in a console application to browse and according to error messages regarding the loading of the browser Module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this is always a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a particular M@@ ime Type ( of course only when it was determined ) , this must be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . for example , phon@@ on shall play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be accessed from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this doesn &apos;t need k@@ x@@ v@@ Player ) . before TV can be configured to use the device and the TV channels . for this purpose , the scanner can be used from the configuration file or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data Rek@@ order ) Settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog for Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be ports detected , i.e. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name will probably contain a DVB sensors .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( presumably this type of play of video devices under Linux is the only the only works ) . this is also only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for the XFree86 server it is necessary to include the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally they are used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of this documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ n@@ av@@ source , d@@ v@@ d@@ source , source code , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ cd , ur@@ b@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with playing the playlist .
are there any indications , as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive , if I lose from it ( not from the VCD file : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is configured as user root after the integration of the device . it is absolutely safe to make that / dev / c@@ drom feature the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU have to be checked for their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time will check the CPU for the first time .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interface and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; k@@ ile ; required .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional character application . under Unix style systems it will probably be accessed on the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; resp . &amp; Tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be found in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should be used for installation , the distribution of the distribution or installation disc ; / DVD .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable an easy installation without comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; web page included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users have to read this hand@@ book well . however , all proposals for documentation is taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation can be created , the contact has to be made via the c@@ ile ; web page .
questions or comp@@ ile questions or comp@@ ile ; on or are extensions , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ surrounding area . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical surface and within this one simple , direct and customized tools for this . conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate . and his ways to learn more about Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start directly with reading the chapter on &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the proper way : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . is the origin of the n@@ g@@ ish &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a loader ( English . L@@ ay ) &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . a less sophisticated but more realistic detection is that it originates from the re@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
if there is just a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book to do it . for example , lat@@ ex , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just like other sign@@ alling languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized features such as paper size , page numbers and text box must be specified with the command \ \ ser@@ ent@@ ery , the kitchen must be closed with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ .
the assistant to the assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is an important function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant is available for the creation of the document . you can also learn some of the document related settings .
docum@@ ent@@ aries : this will mark the type of the document of the document : article ( article ) , Book &#91; Letter &#93; , Message &#91; Letter &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; berry &#93; , projector &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
encoding : hereby the character encoding of the system should be used . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list includes extra packages available for lat@@ ex &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they should only be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to compliance with German DIN regulations ) . they should be used in the creation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t worry about wor@@ ries . it is a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers - as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable text ) , is it with great occurr@@ ence of a gr@@ ass@@ y surface . however , it is not noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it is possible through the modest appearance of the output file .
with automatic delay of environments the command is generated by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; in { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a space line ( for entering the text ) and the added line to close orders . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ tle the lowest element ) :
in the document of the document , the individual elements can be viewed and viewed by a mouse click on the panel .
when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ Ã ¤ use file &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer for the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the document and also other information how the font and is other information about the font type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for view , transformation and printing from DVI ; files for different systems and solutions .
when using the R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ts@@ search , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file is clicked on a element in the DVI ; -@@ file is clicked on the exact opposite of it . once on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is clicked on the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewing direction .
Master @-@ document : this function is used in working with several files . with a master document the work is simplified using other in@@ bound .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
fast construction : lat@@ ex &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error occur in the source code ) .
file recovery : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file is generated on the stream speed , and it does not have a call by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick construction .
on consideration of the Work tool@@ bar should be presented with the three large elements of common elements . the selection fields is designed for quick setting of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... the available lat@@ ex &amp; lat@@ ex ; instructions for sub@@ division :
the selection field Further can be used for items such as keywords , Fu@@ Ã . notes or references . the available mer@@ chandise are :
name : with this command a sample is created for a section , a picture or other element .
reference : is used for reference to a specified designation ( selection includes a selection box ) .
when using quot@@ ation , a selection list of literary entries is displayed . if the file is displayed with literary entries . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ tex ; files are corresponding editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ tex ; can also be written in &amp; cold ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã Â t is used for the definition of the Scrip@@ tures . it can be set to the main text , the Fu@@ ori@@ de notes , and so it is possible to ass@@ ert the following documents :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection venues are available for creation : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document of document and cle@@ aring of the settings . 2 . the document may be written down by the hand .
the brackets on the command \ \ Inclu@@ ded class contain the settings for the command . the settings &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font , it cannot be set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code has to be entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way for this is the use of the menu building or the button .
the source code must be saved prior to comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
note the comp@@ iling of the document , should be searched for errors after the errors . by using Quick @-@ construction &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; it is not the case that the log should also be considered .
a environment ( English ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the written document are created . for example , a report with the font \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { premature ejaculation } will res@@ ili@@ ze the nature of the scriptures and the Ries@@ ig@@ â t . ( English Hu@@ ge ) .
the major changes have only be done within the area ( from \ \ &apos; in { environment } to \ \ by { premature ejaculation } ) , there is no sign of limitation ( number ) for free changes within a environment .
there are many folders to recover and us@@ ability of the document . for example , there must be certain types , grease pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { em@@ ph } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is long as long as it is closed with \ \ , { em@@ ph } or another surrounding area . a single word in one sentence can be consul@@ ted with \ \ em@@ ph { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ by { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to the background of the source text by &amp; lat@@ ex ; the drawing language is displayed , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
once in the assistant a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be carried out . at least , a quote , a few digits in the grease and cur@@ sive pressure and a po@@ em to use , should be seen in order to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor via Editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l E ( with the internal viewer ) . at an external viewer , its window must be closed .
once the DVI ; -@@ file created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is a small file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ ally ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the reading of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converting and computer screen TVs .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as needed for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar offers the conversion of DVI ; -@@ file into other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is created , the conversion can begin by adding other formats by means of the button bar .
the pre @-@ search engine ex@@ h@@ ort the direct jump from the editor to the added position within DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; devices . for this purpose , only Modern under the settings of control ... tools can be selected .
to carry out the pre @-@ search for the mouse , the mouse must be positioned in a line of the source code and to be clicked on the template . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is done so .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; you need &amp; k@@ ile ; used in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor are set ( Settings oc@@ ul@@ ars ... Editor )
if using fast @-@ making of &amp; DVI ; viewing not possible , an error can occur . should one error occur , this is shown in the log file or in the news window .
the log file en@@ ligh@@ tened the error source in the source code . the log file on the error occurs between the errors . the log file is always displayed on the error in which the error appears to be clicked on the error in the log layer , and k@@ ile ; navig@@ ating to the def@@ ective line .
once you click on the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear for selecting the refer@@ ral template for the document . the default settings are :
when selecting a single document , a document may be written either from the ground or the assistant to the fast creation of a new document . more information is included in the section .
the users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file created or a new file created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template via the document of an existing document and a selection of file template .
when creating a new document from a template using file New , some strings may be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing encoding ) . these variables are set up in Settings ... settings .
when creating the own template , it is therefore necessary to know which character strings are replaced by the variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this character string is replaced by entering a document class . typically , they will be used for ma@@ ize : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the Assistant and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps were finished :
when creating a new document , you can organ@@ ise your own template instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for one in the internet and searched among described steps .
&amp; Kate ; uses &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate . is a text editor for programmer with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many att@@ itudes for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; you can be carried out .
to learn more about &amp; Kate . for more , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be done directly by reading the chapter on &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ instruction reference , which can be called for the menu to the La@@ Te@@ X reference . you will contain an exceptional description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
a double click with attached string button to w@@ it the &amp; tex ; -@@ word to w@@ it . this means that clicking on the \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par \ \ font ski@@ p only \ \ par .
when pulling the text with fixed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons with attached envelop@@ es , you can complete parts of the source code in the editorial window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the various types of spring tex@@ tures and these proposals . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are distinguished by a different color .
many assist@@ ants can be accounted for . this is an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . this option is highlighted the jump to the n@@ ave or last j@@ umping mark . this is also highlighted by the jumps on the first input of a drawing , so that it will automatically be applied to the first input of a drawing .
the work is probably one of the main aspect of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate . already excellent value for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; tex@@ tures always many environments and groups and therefore under@@ line supplies which are necessary . under processing , the following commands are included in the text area :
if a complete line of lines ( group of lines containing on both sides have a blank line ) . this extended meaning will not be encrypted with continuous lines , such as tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only characteristic thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the abstra@@ ction are separated by two empty lines .
what is the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , because this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; instructions with a surface of clean ( * ) at the end .
for the occasion of a part of the document , nat@@ ure@@ .@@ K may be removed and by pressing the button . &amp; Kate . offers with your own commands this for a faster result . under Be@@ ing Remove the following commands are done by the text of the text :
a complete sub@@ section . the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description on Edit paragraph .
it has been clear that environments is a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; for example , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under processing area for a fully @-@ fully simple job with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , towards the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the order to the outside of the environment .
with this command , towards the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is placed before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings ) , towards the end of the environment ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
during the input of many fo@@ un@@ ted ambient commands , this command can be lost quickly . this command as@@ sures the last modified environment , so that the inher@@ ited environmental structure is not possible .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also special orders for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups , which are determined by stap@@ les { ... } are intended . under Be@@ Work Te@@ X group are some important commands that meet the surrounding areas .
this command is displayed in the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the closed cl@@ amps .
with this command , towards the end of the current group convers@@ ations ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed straight behind the attached cl@@ amps .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded structure of a &amp; tex ; -@@ Group # is at the other end of the group convers@@ ations ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
during the input of many spac@@ ed groups , groups of cl@@ amps can quickly perish quickly . this command is close to the most covered group , so the inher@@ ited structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be conf@@ used .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two easy touching sign are used as gears . for the purpose of purpose , the sign is &quot; used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows the sign &quot; for two easy touching sign . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and has two close Initi@@ ation marks for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic adjustment of the double temp@@ tation system can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X input and sign@@ posted .
there are also more specific settings ( such as n@@ ally or French ) and may be used with German or French beginnings . there are also many other languages available .
when Dr@@ illing of Shift ; input up &amp; k@@ ile ; it is a smart t@@ eil@@ ing break . in case the current position is located within a lists of environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ it ) , it lies &amp; k@@ ile ; not only one line breaks , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
the current line is closed within a tables of tables ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ with an incur@@ red line break .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; intelligent enough to under@@ score pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to help you create ... La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
some users can arrange the columns in tables in the environments and thereby all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) ; se@@ eks , search &amp; k@@ ile ; according to the latest tab@@ ulator in the above row . although this tab is not the da@@ isy , for example , for the cre@@ ator position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate , has already been offering a good source code , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to include special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . all these modes are available for automatic delay . all these modes can be set for different working methods under settings .. Comp@@ are fully set .
at the beginning a new environment through the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } will automatically add &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ , to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the rings button , the last letter of the input is removed and fully conv@@ ey . on the other hand , the list can be sc@@ aled down by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , this easy jump to these positions by means of j@@ umping jumps brand NEW brand , and the used parameters will be included .
listed under Settings ; establish ... k@@ ile ; Ver@@ n@@ ful settings on this lists . you can realize different wafer lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders as well as accessory for general voice use must be selected .
the command mode will not be igno@@ red in environments . it always must be entered into a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in and the call of the fully @-@ dig@@ ging mode will have a large list with ambient conditions . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for verification in environments .
in order to call the full refund mode , the menu button or the key , Alt + Shift button , the order will automatically be frozen and it appears to be \ \ Beg@@ in . after that , the ambient can be continued to sim@@ pl@@ est way and finish by pressing the input .
once this is complete , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a list of lists , even the first \ \ item command is executed .
under Settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; Ver@@ n@@ ful settings on this lists can be used . this mode uses the list of full refund mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ orders .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ line custom lists of waste materials , which are immediately replaced by changing fonts ... as an example of a dis@@ closure list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l can be found in the example of the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word in complete calculation mode is initiated , or the key , r@@ l + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L will be replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large wi@@ pers are not helpful for automatic fully citizens . however , it has found that many del@@ etes have been written in a document more than once . thus it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the insured for all of them already written .
this mode can be set up in the menu settings ... K@@ ile ver@@ more can be scre@@ ened . here you can also set the sw@@ elling value for displaying the fully util@@ isation .
the full access files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / c@@ ile / c@@ ile / Complete / mode / of the Persian home page . mode is available for de@@ stru@@ ation , Dictionary ( Dictionary ) , Dictionary ( Dictionary ) or tex .
the dialog graphics forms the introduction of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of the graphic formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not so popular as PDF files , but they offer outstanding foundation for free changes and re@@ orders of pages . will be the PDF output ben@@ ches , so you can re@@ arranged the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; we will be converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to realize the result of the work , the source must be compiled into the source . all building tools are group@@ ed into the menu of creating comp@@ iling , creation and create view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source text for viewing such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or another conversion can be converted to Alt ; 3 by using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file is converted into a PS file and can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the command @-@ making , a viewer is called after the comp@@ ile . should not be used to be used to build a new window , each time a new window will be opened .
a new project will be introduced to the project new Project .... : the following information is asked for the project :
when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be given from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the extraction of EC@@ MAS@@ TER@@ .@@ co@@ de . scripts may be managed in the vertical border .
the API scripts are not yet made available , and can grow in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even more .
first of all , we have to say that the development environment of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system@@ ically important object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly large system in which the basic functions are extended by a wide range of selected packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help for sub@@ mitting the users .
Tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ til ; become delivered with many documents . included are a documentation for the contained packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
it &apos;s not only a full re@@ location for &amp; tex . it &apos;s not only asked for a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) but rather , it is ideal for searching for a particular form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; Tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; the final document is not always easy . as a common help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ tr@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; provided documents and this for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the above @-@ mentioned advantage is the search for par@@ c@@ als or stro@@ kes . of &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the bed of the space bar open the viewer for the document .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us , may have to do with &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; even though , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can get from the additional functionality now and don &apos;t need to wait until som@@ ebody can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; they can find more below .
to install a plug@@ in or a K@@ part we begin with the plug @-@ in Edit menu . thus , the following dialog will open :
this dialog allows to manage all of the contained plug @-@ ins and add new images . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element therein :
here you can enter the search path . add the plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; this path leads to the search of the plug@@ ins .
often work on a project several people in a kind hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship together . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the leading name of the user and serves for a clear identification .
one member may have several roles in the project , including both team manager and sub @-@ project leader .
the user can select even from the list of the team members who he is . this is done by step@@ ping the team member from the list and express the S@@ etze as being pressed . the currently selected member ( your identification ) appears after you are : text .
top names and setting of your own identity are important about messages and notes . see for further information to ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage through the acquisition of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leader if something particular happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are carried out if something specific in the project happens . an example would be the drawing of opening and closure of the project , such as someone else worked , or the sending of a message if a file is secured , or a script that will be added to the CV@@ S if they will be added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog boxes can be created , processed and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see list selected in the receiver list . address can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see where , this ladder can be set up .
remarks are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note is simple . it may choose either the note @-@ entry from the Editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comment zone , followed by not@@ ices text .
note that a particular member of the team may be sent . in this case , the name @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , plays a role in the project from the following options : team leader , Sub@@ project manager , following the enrich@@ ing and sub@@ project guides , should be given the corresponding range or sub@@ project names , as in the examples below .
sur@@ name and roles names are independent of large or small sh@@ outs , but spaces for the cl@@ as@@ ps and note : make the note to be inv@@ alid .
&amp; Bra@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ing languages , which supports D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and script @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing .
the settings are available through the Settings menu . here are only about &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be called by means of Quant@@ a ... This dialog extends over some pages which are treated to each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car rounds , can be modified . the entries are :
large / small sc@@ roll@@ ment of tags : large / small sc@@ roll@@ ment of automatically added tags : normal large / small bills , the tags are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / small sc@@ iss@@ ure of At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks : large / small ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation of automatically attached attri@@ bute . normal large / Klein@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting means , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically shut : when an@@ ni@@ ed , will be optional for tags for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not available as optional tags : as above for all other tags with exception of the simple tags .
start and end date automatically update : if enabled , the respective closing date will be updated and vice vers@@ a .
automatic er@@ ent character : controls the automatic conversion of acute characters in the appropriate coding during enem@@ as .
M@@ ime types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for identi@@ fying various types of files . using the default setting the default settings can be recovered .
default Dra@@ wing coding : encoding of newly created or in other way than with file opening open files ( where encoding the file can be igno@@ red ) , but this setting is un@@ loaded by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting is em@@ itted by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regularly securing copies , so that with a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . also for yet un@@ saved documents , a backup is created , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editorial area or their own view ( or documentation in a cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter ) , what makes it possible to view the documentation , viewing and source code at the same time .
put the window settings on the standard back at the next start is useful if the user interface are crossed by changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages area is used for the tax of the possibility to activate the display of war@@ nings by no more .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure of the Par@@ ser can be set in the document with details of the Par@@ ser no@@ des .
in the mouse poin@@ ter , click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the structure with clicking the mouse button with the mouse button .
in the area of structural settings , the visibility of no@@ des in tree , the actu@@ ality frequency of the tree can be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found in which the current document was no element found .
the range for removing ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded for many &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s , each may be valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s , it may be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ cl@@ ause short@@ cut anything else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are part of the third side , which can be re @-@ used by each K@@ part @-@ capable Application , most well @-@ known &amp; @-@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug@@ ins must be the following :
address : the path to the plug@@ in if it is not at a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is handed over to the Plug@@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated file ( path of current file ) or project folder .
component of the &quot; Only &quot; mode &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in can refuse to store . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load when this option is not chosen .
check the plug @-@ in : is it activated , then test &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . you can also select the store , if the plug@@ in at the moment is not available , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; since version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting was completely redesigned . Di@@ e@@ Support for the not required built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was adjusted , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in concept was implemented , which allows various implem@@ entations via plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug @-@ in available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quantitative ap@@ l@@ us .
use of the deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project starts with selecting a matching deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the button options beside the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a deb@@ ug@@ ger is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view that is displayed in the content of displayed variables . usually in the left dock .
a view that all holding point , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually in the lower dock .
a view that is shown in the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger . usually in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to de@@ bug , if required , or it divi@@ des the plug@@ in with you to listen to deb@@ ug@@ ging . this promotion is opened by default , that a deb@@ ug@@ ger will not be considered .
the counter@@ part on deb@@ ug@@ ging session Star@@ te the session . includes the connection to deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ate the gear according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server by a Deb@@ ug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser being displayed to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
shows the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script and the up@@ loaded line . if this happens , while the script will continue , the execution is begun , before a deb@@ ug@@ ging requirement has started , the script will start with the request .
trig@@ gers the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script , without information to over@@ clock variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script will continue , the execution begins as soon as a requirement is set .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger will execute the next instruction in script , without entering the functions or include .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger will execute the next instruction in script , where if possible in functions and include in error .
shows the deb@@ ug@@ ger to move the instruction and go to the next way , than if the current does not exist .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us to your needs , and how you can help &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; help to get better .
docum@@ ent@@ ment units ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for marking and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; your simplicity and flexibility makes it a quick , user friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or CSS ; s &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s consist of two parts , the tag file and the tool@@ bars . tag tool@@ bars contain two file types , the text and instructions faster into a document as one user could include .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be created suspended ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see details for converting itself .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , A &amp; D@@ T@@ EP .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property for the day . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; self @-@ tool@@ bars allow a fast insert of tags in a document without any loss of a writing system .
tag folder are nothing as a folder . you can only contain the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder support the name of the editor language and version , present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML , and declare if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better viewing and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limits are described in simple ways .
this is the root mod@@ el@@ element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur only once in a document , but it can contain the definition of many tags , but there is nothing else than that .
type of tags is a script function . when using it , att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day class class . the name of the basic class for this class ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . gives the name of the class where this method is heard . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has added common attributes and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is a only element element .
describes a attri@@ bute an tags . this element can only occur once for each attri@@ bute . additionally , it lays down the name and the type of attri@@ bute . additionally , it contains further tags that describe how this attri@@ bute is to appear &amp; etc ; This is a merely element element .
specifies the source codes for the attributes in the tag editor and on At@@ tri@@ butes tree to
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an inter@@ section and method name . the arguments that can be handed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tags .
a container day put together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for a attributes . it is an element type element .
puts the position of the attri@@ bute tex@@ tured an tags within a dialog . this day can occur for each attri@@ bute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the use of defined tags . this element is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that complete a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; XML version = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly coupled and closed .
spaces are not influence on &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be made by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , particularly in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ box &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files is the tools dialog up in the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ window to start and check the Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . choose a further dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . at present , check only with the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us .
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt @-@ scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the file name is to be schem@@ atic tag .
in the following an example for an functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP @-@ file is described . the file name of this day XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; function &quot; re@@ bre@@ Type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be edited by D@@ TD uses D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ se@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; should be prepared for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; should be prepared with following entries :
&#91; General &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD @-@ indication . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as n@@ name .
a action can be set up with settings ... to be created . click New action to the same dialog :
this action assigned to the CTR@@ L button . with clicking the button User may be assigned to a key shor@@ tw@@ ave , with K@@ one is the current keyboard gra@@ ce@@ able .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . a text in the detailed settings can be entered and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that the document may change or use as input ( or parts of the document ) ; himself are the quick start @-@ dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ EP@@ s .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % skri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh@@ .@@ This way attempts to find &amp; quantitative information : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / Quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file names are : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text must be assigned to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the remote script .
the parameter for this event , usually the date of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above @-@ mentioned methods , a script will receive inputs of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; in the default area , input can be determined , which can be determined to the default account . possibilities :
the selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be derived . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output . it can be specified , which is specified to the default output release by selecting the text box output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in the case there are not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
as soon as a tool@@ bar add , you need to add actions and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom end of the window will start edit mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar .
complete all , if the day has attributes and you can plan your use , activate the dialog &quot; Tag , &quot; when available , with an input when using action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is it an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action with this icon ? if we replace it before we trouble difficulties .
for creating a symbol that the promotion represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; select from the &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ ; , graphics further programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose size and others .
please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
with regard to that the day started , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually used as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to user interface , click here ; -@@ Day in the current document will be entered .
after creating a symbol it must still be connected to the action . this is done by the menu with settings of action ... ( in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . apart from the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be divided into several groups . open the tool@@ bars for setting the tool@@ bars . make sure that the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to choose the Tren@@ ner ( all left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that will be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar .
for example , I wish to preview a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note the group@@ ing of the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; kno@@ b the opposite of the Start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by test all symbols to ensure that everything works .
save in the right folder . after re@@ e@@ XML is not found , it will be created in the right folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be saved in the right folder , so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) is loaded , if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most mentioned extension of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language you like . this chapter describes how I use a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentary , you could check the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory check if anyone has done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to let the doc@@ r@@ c file . let &apos;s make the first part we deal here .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c You = Path , relative to this file , for example PHP 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these docum@@ entations e.g. &amp; PHP 4.@@ html Section 2 = # Sec@@ tions Sec@@ 1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ s.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP documentation here ; documentation as something like this :
# K@@ DE config File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = php@@ 42 / # top level Elements Top element = PHP 4.2 on Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = introduction , ... introduction = bal@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = t@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ taxes .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that there are no under@@ file in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess boards ( except by understanding ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
note that the index is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ent@@ ally shown at the top end of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces are not influence anything , but take care of &amp; &amp; w ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative . res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ eries are replaced .
the active section is the range of doc@@ r@@ c file , which is intended to be displayed in the context of a con@@ tex@@ tual help . for example , if the documentation for the m@@ ys@@ q@@ l _ Fet@@ ch _ array function would be displayed directly . there are only two types of records here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file Connection .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file doc@@ r@@ c easily and would like to save $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc /
if you &apos;re sure that this well and it is worth to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used to use &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for use by the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can send by email to friends , partners , or else . at different places there is an email send menu entry , like D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) via email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive from where all other &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download and only be made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for the publication . to make a useful contribution if it is guaranteed for a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key , which is guaranteed for our team as well as for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG keys ( the Pas@@ we@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you may check out a button ( URL Pre@@ view can remain empty ) , and click OK with click &quot; OK . &quot;
upload the up@@ loading of the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , the tool@@ bar will be up@@ loading , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree can be started .
after downloading a resource , still before the installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quantitative determination of the resource due to examination of integrity and Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in case of problems war@@ n and it may be cancelled . if the integrity is given and the resource has been signed , a message appears with the indication of the owner &apos;s website .
it is possible to work on XML languages which currently is not yet supported by &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the creation can be needed temporarily , because hundreds of day files can be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD Lo@@ ad and Convert D@@ TD . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD @-@ description which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Defin@@ itive forms : the character string that will appear on the DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE day like HTML PU@@ B@@ L@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d appear
fine adjustment of D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , takes &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; following the conversion of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand these and full use of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; this chapter one tries to accommodate them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quantitative . little use .
in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the working range is divided into three areas : global , locally and projected . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for each , the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . of tool@@ bars over actions it is possible to secure the common structure of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure multiple tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree that are then available to each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of Web@@ Develop@@ ments for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user @-@ directory , so that they only use this user personally .
all elements are available only within a specific project . this may be everything from &amp; CSS ; designs up to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project . just said this is the most limited size . all items are stored in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editorial window , the construction views , the boxes with information and tool@@ bars . please beat in , and for more information about these areas .
you can click with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document of matching entries , such as close the current , other or all cart@@ ei@@ vers , re @-@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or version of CV@@ S commands for the current document .
legal click in the editorial range lead to a further context menu concerning the revised documentation , such as fundamental machining steps ( cut / copy / insert ) , using the mouse poin@@ ter to the mouse or open the file , if the string is described under the mouse poin@@ ter a file .
at the top end of the editorial staff there are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; quantitative ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional than standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and thus linked users .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in their document then click the icon representing the day . you should add a day that has several attributes ( such as anchor ) , insert it into a dialog different fields .
the installation views ( Q@@ IT ) enable it to open to &amp; quantitative information ; to navigate to open and walk through . in the representation with cart@@ ei@@ vers are available for files , project , pattern templates , documentation structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quantitative tool ; providing all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , upload or del@@ etion of files from the storage media can be done with the displayed context menu .
another option of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; it &apos;s all the possibilities open .
templates may be divided into three categories , depending on which connections are used . the category depends on &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; working range . global templates are always available , local templates for the corresponding users and templates are in use only in the project . more to templates is found in .
here you can find information on the available script languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Local and Project can also work here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can edit the available information about a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , like e.g. the script will send you to or send it with email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ click the cur@@ sor in the document to the position of the element . by right click of an element that gives a view of commands to navigation and view of the tree .
this tree appears among other construction views . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the modification of all available attributes with a few clicks is possible .
here is the complete documentation for web technology to find your development . it can be downloaded @-@ packed documentation for &amp; quantitative determination . you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add project specific documentation , edited and viewed .
by default &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; two cart@@ ei@@ vers at the bottom end of the window , can be reached via the use@@ able information : the message window and the problem window .
this Card shows information on any script in Quant@@ a . such , e.g. the D@@ TD of the latest document , and all changes to the D@@ TD being displayed .
this cartridge re@@ sh@@ ines shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quantitative scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( such as there is ) in this window .
the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show it on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate sets of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own orders as symbols in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us .
another feature of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with email . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you get a tool bar in an email , you can secure it in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; as any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ In order to obtain a complete list of all options , specify . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and here not executed .
if you have problems with starting &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of their bin folders . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combined a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us started to address ; what would be if &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , extended mark@@ up languages would be ? well , this would do it for the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; now you can define it on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . you can then define it should be &amp; quantitative , then should be &amp; quantitative , for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the af@@ ore@@ mentioned efforts must be noted that &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; as follows , is the idea of what has been developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ report is not only this possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; so to expand as they need for their need .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developments the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can expand the productivity almost every task . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , you can expand using a scrip@@ tural character . ( more about it you will find in . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was conceived for fast web development and quickly developed to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus is in any way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for details about the details documentation is done with help : / Quant@@ a ( either to enter this URL in &amp; quer@@ or ; enter or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Quant@@ a ) .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; is currently developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de.@@ org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia hydro@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de.@@ org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you can open a file , which is not on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for later use . check in the section above templates . should try to save the selected file / Text outside the local / project backup folder , only one error is reported .
convert from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ sh@@ elling , allowing them correctly and not be understood from browser as form@@ att@@ ing instruction .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Sch@@ abor@@ tion , which is the correct way to insert special signs and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first line to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day are used .
allows to select the recorder to or out . this allows you to choose text blocks with the &amp; shift ; button to select .
directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages is available !
sear@@ ches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined expression to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window in which you can see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
extension and en@@ ching of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; main projection . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column links to the main window . this column allows you to set the wire using a mouse click .
when the book@@ marks in the current file , it will appear in the menu together with entries previous or nearest , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu Group following the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens a existing project from hard disk . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searched the project directory to new files that could be there . that allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or a sub@@ folder and then add it to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
att@@ itudes , how &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects find the details explained .
loads a project tool bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . only actions need to be added to the name . actions are saved via tool tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars using the tool@@ bars .
remov@@ es a tool@@ bar from the visual field . does not delete the hard drive . if you have not yet saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
therefore , you can send your own tool bar to someone ( perhaps at the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Team , so the tool bar will be available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as app@@ endix .
enables the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , where any other one can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; you have made , or anything else has made and convert into the &amp; quantitative representation ; own image format .
download / ref@@ resh the discover@@ ies from the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is useful if the unloading of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP is to renew , without renew the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this globally is and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not available , loading the shop .
this menu contains a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the default is loaded ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is available in the tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current tag setup dialog when there is one . this entry is available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific under@@ men@@ tia .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent add @-@ in tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . smar@@ ter means that &amp; quantitative att@@ oos does not refuse to refuse the rules on this place if this day does not contra@@ di@@ ct the rules .
the plug @-@ in menu are listed in the plug @-@ in menu , the available menu entries are listed below the menu entries . click on the activated plug @-@ in off .
select the syn@@ taxes control mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ es depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version from .
cho@@ oses the type of line @-@ related key . very useful if you know people using other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the document on the selected &amp; D@@ TD using the external application T@@ id@@ y .
instant change@@ over between different types of user interface . due to several restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over time may need or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card statement mode , which is also the default setting mode , or the sub @-@ window mode , which is the presentation in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu requires an entry for every open window . with a selection of a entry , the corresponding window will be activated .
to@@ g@@ gles the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
the changes in this dialog will affect each application which can use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; @-@ quer@@ or ; web browsers .
the behavior of the editorial staff . in the documentation of &amp; Kate . find details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or modify the sequences .
that should therefore produce a help according to the m@@ aus@@ er &apos;s environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project you can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quantitative representation ; development in financial form , you will find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here is the name for the project , for example , fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled .
this is the name of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the names of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can address the server address of the machine that you want to access , one , except you processed local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if this field is empty , the default settings of the selected log is used . depending on the setup of remote computers , it could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a joint collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . when a joint collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
that allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . several files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great , if you want to change the static contents you want to change and change . at ser@@ ver@@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
do not act if files are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be embedded in the main folder of the project . if a project is not begun at a new project .
this option will show all files and folders inside the main folder and you can make a precise selection of goo@@ d@@ will .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by an@@ aft or , by removing the Hä@@ k@@ ite , out of the project .
the latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be instantly upload in the menu with project Properties in the menu tree or with the key@@ word Shift ; F@@ 7 changed .
some settings are described in the project assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ame ( plac@@ eholder possible ) will be igno@@ red in a project related operations such as project folders .
additional option to be listed above , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view that will be loaded when opening the project , can be read more about proj@@ ections .
this can be selected by the deb@@ ug@@ ger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information on G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set with the options . in the setup the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is described .
in the bottom window profiles can be up@@ loading and up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a construction for the content of the server for each profile by adding a dedicated building view for each profile .
in the Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see also details .
in the bottom window event configuration , you can change event actions and delete these actions , or delete this event . event actions are carried out if a previously specified event can occur , such as the back@@ ing of a file . see in the details .
open by default &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behavior is not affected by default .
to open a different project , open the Project ... from the menu Project or the Project project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog box will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will automatically be saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; Modi@@ fied files will be found . the same happens when you download a new project .
the project view is free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
file changes equally , however , the entries must open and open with ... in the right mouse button in the right context menu :
several profiles can be chosen here . profile contains information on the place of highly permitted files . see .
allows for removing the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button appears to avoid removing the removal .
the password will retain in the core memory and it is needed . this option is useful when common up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password of the disk option is not listed in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ loading profiles can be created and the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to several servers . when editing or creating a profile is displayed this dialog :
this is the name of the server to copy the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the Transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . usually this must not be changed except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port .
depending on your Ang@@ ular shaft , this is either a time saving function or a danger . do not use it after your discretion . the password is not simply read on the plate , but each with programming knowledge it can easily see in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in a project that means , by simple diving of the view , several files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the current open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored in the menu or the project tool@@ bar , be accessed via settings of the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . it helps to increase productivity but also allows adjustment of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; on its own working mode .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; best on the menu tool@@ bars . use and adding to the tool@@ bar . add the tool@@ bars below in the section add tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by means of the context menu ( right click on the tool bar ) , a new tool@@ bar may be configured as tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar , or tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog where actions on this or other tool@@ bar should be visible .
by calling the context menu to a action plan ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , additionally the entries will be removed and action displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory to action .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings of tool@@ bars and set settings ..
templates are essentially docum@@ ent@@ els , code @-@ cut@@ lets and files for lin@@ king . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; used templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or any of the system existing directory in the template tree ; Templates have in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you need for the file system .
some with &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; included templates have the conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified on the start of each template .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are normally inserted in documents via short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are in the Ball@@ room under global templates . further information on templates are available in .
documents can be created by any text documentation . on the basis of this templates may be created new documents . normally , a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es work in a corresponding way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the basic tree under global templates . see in for more information about templates tree .
this type of templates is useful if there is not a new document based on a template but the same text range always should be inserted into documents . you can find everything about a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are available in the Ball@@ room under global templates . see also for more information on templates .
as the name says , this templates are used for all sites than templates . they are a collection of various documents , which can be arranged in a file structure , compiled into a compressed file archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us .
shape a document structure according to your ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template as local presentation ....
as soon as the happen , note that ( even if it was stored as a project position ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the Ball@@ room under project requirements .
select text in your document and click on the file as template selection as local / project templates . alternatively , the option can easily be drawn with pulling and down on the templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file formats can only be used in a pad@@ dock . all file management functions can be used for purposes such as pulling and storing or insert over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click into a file tree or in the project files to create a folder on your right and secure site template , a name for the template and secure . by default , it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal oriented approach . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ ings pre@@ ference or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create files , add or to them . in addition , some things can retain the use of templates in projects very low @-@ green in the eye .
the presentation structure in the bottom window is based on the files created in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / Quant@@ a / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Quant@@ a / templates / templates . each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers , as stated above .
to define the behavior of a folder in the map box with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu properties . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is hidden once the attri@@ bute attributes are inher@@ ited .
this is enabled by default and adapted for everything except for the pedi@@ atri@@ um . if a gen@@ eric player would be set in general , except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of normal folder the Bla@@ h would appear with something like text boxes . if nothing appears , it is probably found in a ancest@@ or .
allows a set or re@@ painted text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or floor parts for all templates for a specific project and allows a whole presentation with special head@@ lines / foot lines a whole presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot lines .
in addition , using the context menu ( shown on the right mouse button ) using a full command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that are accessible via the menu . the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : he invites you to document a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; you can edit and edit the source code editor in which the modifications in the V@@ PL mode can be displayed in source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , a small green symbol symbol@@ ises the V@@ oh@@ em@@ bal@@ es of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editing &amp; PHP . there is no plans to change this behaviour .
the second mode works just like the first , except that simultaneously the changes both in the source editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron runs . with pressures of F9 , this mode is already active , the key transfer is shi@@ fted by the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source code is adjustable via settings Quant@@ a . in addition to selecting from a click or automatically select the period of time . basically , the recommendation can be set automatically . basically , the recommendation can be set for fast computers and a large pot for long durability .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the processing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also possible , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is also possible . that is how a new document can be created with the V@@ PL ; it may change the following :
met@@ a @-@ Tags will allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons on the column , e.g. keywords on column names and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the creation of pages in browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list , or delete a change over the met@@ a elements , which is currently not supported in the met@@ a elements .
it is possible to insert a external CSS style by clicking on the file button and select the appropriate file .
the usage of the cur@@ s@@ ors is like in a text processing , possible due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ved as usual . the mark can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by plug@@ g@@ ging and delete back or ar@@ net@@ ting back .
the insertion of tags will be made in the same way through the tool@@ bars as in the source text editor . it is too aware that the insertion of tags must be removed from previously existing identical tags if an anchor day is surrounded by text , any other ambient air must be removed .
some tool@@ bars such as tables @-@ assistant or the lists assist@@ ent are de@@ activated . you will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists can be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of styles . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the styles can be pursued .

there are many graphical tools for compare , so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribution made many changes , and at the same time , a further programmer had changed in the same file a lot of text . the result was numerous conflicts in coll@@ ision .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no hin@@ ts referring to the places , where perhaps only the insertion was changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences in one line and modifications to white characters . later , any amount of other useful features were added later .
if you want to compare this example quickly , copy it into cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the comparative window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ gers of folders . this function related &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way combination is fully supported . this is useful if two persons are independently of one piece of co@@ de and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to process the dis@@ sol@@ ving result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the compar@@ isons and merge @-@ up folders . this screen photograph shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the folder merge :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and le@@ aned the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you are often checked , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines only distinguish only in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a look at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble when no one changes the reading . )
if a file is equal , and the other distingu@@ ishes itself in one line , then the colour indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can simpli@@ fy the ti@@ pping work by simply write the file names of the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder with diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder
the opening dialog allows to manually tap the selection of fil@@ en@@ ame , the selection of file formats ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the list . you need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences are carried out with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also choose a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or merge folders will be selected , for B and C , however , a file then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders .
if coll@@ usion is active , the input field is active for target and process . however , it is not necessary to define a output file as soon as possible . you can also finish this step later when saving .
the setup kno@@ b opens a dialog with settings . here you can set the options before you start with the compar@@ isons / merge .
sometimes one would not want to compare all the file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . when opening , you don &apos;t need to select the dialog box with the setup button .
you can also use pulling and finish : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window .
what thought is behind ? sometimes it contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions , you would need to create two appropriate files that would need to copy them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can copy and compare these relevant sections . now you can compare and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; extract . only the game can be supported in a comparative window .
warning : some editors can interpre@@ t the dra@@ ve and put text into another program as sample and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the info screen . the info screen of the source window contains characters A , B or C , the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path is too long ) , let the mouse button for a while on the line . then a small relief window will display the full name . )
the three spring windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one sees the color , which file differs . if both files are different , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that is in the next section ( merge ) good too .
in addition to the text , the column is displayed . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters is only relevant in strings and comments , for the processor and in a few , rare cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the cl@@ ut@@ ches column from the text , is interrupted in the positions where the respective source file has no lines . if the line is activated , the line will be displayed on broken lines .
the result window ( under the comparison chart ) also has a info line with the inscription edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ as@@ changes &#93; if you have handled the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been dissolved , the store is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to next post / uns@@ ol@@ ved opposition to find the yet remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative values are used , each difference must be solved manually at the same time .
by a click with the left mouse button in a window , the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed in all windows , where the beginning of the group is not visible . ( this group will be highlighted by the beginning of the group . ) This group will be highlighted by the colour background color for current and on the left comes a black beam .
sometimes stays through automatic mer@@ ging or manual editing , no other line is left in the group ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your mind and might not return any other source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , yet in a mark which may might copy and insert it differently .
the text &amp; lt ; merge tracking , however , appears in cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the net windows . continue carefully with this function .
note : if selecting the sources the options are igno@@ red or igno@@ res C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white sign .
this will also be shown mainly with the image bars and mouse , but you can also use the keys on the left , right , high , r@@ under , side down , at the end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ beginning and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ end , Si@@ w you can also be used by other programs . the over@@ l@@ ts column can be used in addition to the vertical pixel pitch can also be used for navig@@ ating .
in the eye window you can also use the other buttons to work . with the Ins@@ ert button , you can switch between feet and outdoor @-@ shift mode . ( default is set @-@ down mode )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary column is synchron@@ ized the view of all windows in the beginning of the respective group ( as in the section ) and the ed@@ itable exit window was explained .
the tool bar includes seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ bottom / C@@ tr@@ l picture down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous in@@ oc@@ clu@@ ding conflicts . therefore , all non @-@ automatically sol@@ uble conflicts must be regarded as conflict . therefore , it must be distinguished between sol@@ uble and un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the marking into cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ insert ) . if this option is enabled , you will automatically copy the cli@@ p@@ board and copy the manual copy . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally write the contents of cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ cores are saved according to the under@@ lying operating system \ \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use Car @-@ based \ \ \ \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 reserves the line @-@ up of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with binary files .
the files and list of the last used files will be stored automatically and re@@ produced at the next start . ( menu Ins@@ ulation &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use this . )
if you dis@@ able this option , differences are displayed in cur@@ sive script . if the chosen font does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rolled out . on these systems , the button settings will automatically set an od@@ d color .
when this option is enabled , the tab@@ ulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character is inserted .
if you press input or return , the return on the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , every selection will be automatically copied to cli@@ p@@ board . manual copy in cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ende type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used .
in the comparison of files tried &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters are igno@@ red every line . in this step , white signs are not igno@@ red . in this step , white signs are not igno@@ red .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car back sign &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , but then you could save files with different sizes on the side @-@ on @-@ side comparison , although they vary differently . if this option is enabled , the car changes have been de@@ activated , but as a white character is de@@ activated . during operation , this option is de@@ activated .
the default option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are igno@@ red . in the result the differences are displayed nevertheless , but they will be treated like white characters .
the default option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs .
intensive after still looking for smaller differences . the option is activated in the default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow to very large files .
in the automatic set @-@ up mode , setting this setting , how long the result of the selection is displayed , before the coming of the coming conflict is displayed .
automatically dis@@ solves all the conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if you need to ignore the sel@@ ectiv@@ ity A / B / C for all uns@@ ol@@ ved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatically sel@@ ections are disp@@ uted in numbers or comments if the options are igno@@ red or igno@@ red C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the chapter to the scan of folders and guides a merge . see for details on documentation on the list compare and merge tracking .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version of the suff@@ ix file is attached to the suff@@ ix . original exists , it will be deleted without backup .
adjust@@ s the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it is not available that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global over the control centre . )
the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if one enabled this option , the entries will be used for all entries .
over the selection fields for encoding is a short notice that the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed ) and has an inform@@ al character . )
custom@@ ize the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters is treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have handled a file , you can define what encoding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing operations , they could not work with your codec . ( for example , your files might have 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the default tool command can only handle encoded using 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can fix the coding of the output of for@@ cing operations .
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in the text or over@@ sight . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are igno@@ red or igno@@ red C / C + + judgement . )
this selection is available only if you compare three files . in normal mode all differences in a colour coded over@@ saf@@ er column are displayed . however , you may only see the differences between two of three files . to choose from A &amp; B ; B &amp; B &amp; B &amp; B ; C will be displayed next to the normal still a second over@@ lay column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . don &apos;t simply use the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison windows next to each other . this may also be useful to ads of long lines . ( this option is on the window menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and decide to summar@@ ize the files . a simple click brings together the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as the default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it is displayed first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which is exactly your needs . you can use this function e.g. , for cut @-@ out parts or correct to correct loading .
when reading a file it is given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is specified only by line . the command of the command is only identical with the line . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the thought behind it is to enable more flexibility when teaching the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users would like to program the good news . however , the good news is that in most cases SE@@ D or per@@ l are completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ directly to the input in upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ U \ \ 1 / \ \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ent expression on each string and therefore refers to the found text in the first cl@@ ung . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to automatically generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experim@@ enting with SE@@ D , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expres@@ sions even . you are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the igno@@ red of numbers actually is a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ equal . SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a suitable matches , and any hits will be replaced by nothing but quasi @-@ deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several terms at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; use it to separate the requirements of each other . example :
instead SE@@ D you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / en@@ forcement / switches &apos; aller@@ gen needs some details differently . where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are retained for displaying and merge . furthermore , the further operations do not change the data that the line is equal to al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal processor , the line remote processor sees the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function which changes the text , or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often programmer must process many files in a file . for this reason you can compare and merge complete folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... for every object a proposal to merge ; you can custom@@ ize the suggest@@ ion before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulate and show the sim@@ ulated changes without they really do ,
... select selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F6 button ) ,
this is the compar@@ isons and merge of individual files very similar . you need only file the folder on the command line or the dialog file .
if there are three folders , folder 1 is used as base . if no target folders was specified , used &amp; ch@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start , not the merge . to press the merge , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow . )
while reading the folder you can find a small message window over the current progress . if you start scanning the folders , only the files will be listed until then .
if the scan of the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and each folder found during the Scan can be displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click here .
the file structure is normally folded . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the menu or by clicking the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories and can fold all the directories with which you can open all the folders .
if you double to a file , the file comparison will start and there will be a comparative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the chosen object is visible . in such a case , the coll@@ hr action plan can not be chosen automatically . if the coll@@ ision is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , the colours are red , green , yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C .
with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries are different .
st@@ ew@@ ards are identical as identical if its total content is identical . then folders also have the same color . at folders , the age is quite considerable for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ ts . colors reflect the colors of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , if it exists )
... A and B identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , if it exists )
... B and C identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and a file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects , the coll@@ ation cannot be started .
... A and B cannot have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and a file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects , the coll@@ ation cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ization mode is active if only two folders and no explic@@ it targets have been specified and if the option is synchron@@ ize directories . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the required action is identical , so that both files are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : assemble and save the result into both folders . ( the user can look as the visible data names for the output file only B ; directly after coll@@ ision and de@@ fle@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders can be merged and select the new file instead of mer@@ ging ( uns@@ af@@ e ) , then try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files are differently , but the date is identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange are not fixed , the cl@@ adding can not be started .
during mer@@ ging , a file is working after the other . you state @-@ column shows off when the coll@@ ation was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected fail@@ ures , you should make a final review , and see if the status is in order .
if set @-@ on dialog the file &apos;s comparative analysis is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 will show further columns . this contains the number of ex@@ er@@ mon@@ ast@@ eries , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts will be shown only when three folders can be compared or merged . )
you can either merge the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all entries at one time . if you have selected all the merge orders ( also in all sub @-@ folders ) you can start coll@@ ision .
please note : if you have no target folder , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode C , it will be used as the target and synchron@@ ize A and / or B as target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries must be displayed in the target folder , there are some options to be displayed in the file structure . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant sur@@ prises :
to summar@@ ize all entries : select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard gra@@ f ) . to carry out the current item : select the action of the current element or press F6 .
if the case of contra@@ dic@@ tory file types still exist , a message appears that the def@@ ective items will appear . you can then select a valid promotion for them .
when you lead all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options , sim@@ ulating and breaking off .
choose Sim@@ ulate If you would like to see what would happen , without the really changes , you will then get a detailed list of all the actions .
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; then causes certain actions with all entries due to all entries . if a manual input is necessary ( merge a single file ) then a merge window opens ( please note the screen photo ) .
if you are ready with a file , select the directory entry again and press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialogue appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed Status information . at the end of the list see some error messages that will help you to try or to try the problem of problem . so , you have the option to select a different action for the entry or enter the problem in any way before you proceed with the merge .
if several entries have been merged , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this entries ( in the current session ) and performs them together with all entries . even if the merge updates are taken or not saved , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ) has now a section called folder merge with these options :
only files that are displayed on the sample are displayed in the element tree . several samples can be entered . separate plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * .@@ folders do not need to match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than one sample , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a partition . valid Order : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than one sample , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a partition . valid Order : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
igno@@ red files which are also igno@@ red by CV@@ S . many built @-@ in files are igno@@ red by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore ) .
in some file systems files have a hi@@ ding -@@ attri@@ bute . in other file systems you may choose a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
when links to files : if the option is switched on , symbolic links are compared to . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links are disabled . this is de@@ activated by default .
when links to the file : if the option is switched on , the links are treated like normal files and recur@@ sively sear@@ ches . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; do not lead on possible records . ( note that this option would lead to a final loop and ch@@ ill 3 ; crash@@ es ) This option is shut down in the default settings .
a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , inv@@ ents , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower , if they do not contain any text . ( specify an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare big folders through a slow network , it is possible to compare only the change date and the file size . however , this speed advantage will be worth a certain degree of safety . please be careful with caution . this option is set in the default value .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison instead . the files will be regarded as identical if in copying the change date has lost . please be careful with caution . this option is set in the default value .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ize mode if two folders can be compared and no target folders . in this mode , the suggestions concerning merge settings are selected so that both folders are identical . this option is shut down in both folders . this option is set in default .
if there are differences , instead the copying of the newer file as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , because the other file is not changed too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is shut down in default .
if a file or file is replaced by a different file , then the original version is renamed , then the extension .@@ original . if a old backup file is already established with the .@@ original extension , this will also be deleted without any backup . this option is enabled in default . this option is switched on .
normally the folder merge tool would result in the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window distribution with the mouse . if you do not want that option to switch the directory &amp; text windows , switch the main window in the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text windows between the two views .
probably , you prefer to compare a file simply by double click , but if you can drive a single file directly , you can use the current file merge in the directory menu . once you use the result , the status is set to be done and the file will not be merged again when you run the folder .
this status is however lost when you read the directory again : directory menu : new to read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open your files and folders based on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
one URL has another syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relatively . or .. contain . that &apos;s not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle , &gt; % 20 , etc . ) , for example , has a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes on the server system , sometimes caused by the protocol , a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder . then , a file is always adopted as a link goal . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore we sof@@ ten the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note the option tru@@ est in the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files )
the main use of the main use is currently in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
typically I need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as K@@ part , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the generation of Patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part thereof , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the same from folders will not be supported in the K@@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is composite ) . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 shows that it can lead coll@@ usion such as the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GPL software programs very long and I have learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone on this road or let him go .
you have compiled the program from sources compiled and configure the configure script to K@@ DE . in the default settings installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. col@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find further information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters differently , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is treated differently , the line will be treated as non @-@ identical . if all Lines has received the next to Each other , this toll is the bal@@ is of the case .
the editor is referring to any difference in the files where he begins and where it ends . this important information goes to the source and select the button in the source file and select it is too much effort to design an extra &apos;s own file format that could store this information .
the effort for it was so far too big . you can always restore a specific version of selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of the text should be used any other editor .
after removing text is suddenly light ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ers ; released and the text is not extingu@@ ish . what does it mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to emphas@@ ize differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting from colleagues and many people from the game Wild Web . thank you !
to ut@@ ili@@ ze all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .

a list of recent changes will be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the ch@@ angel@@ og file in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ yourself gives the folder installed in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ af@@ e , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless , consult difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mail@@ ing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift Del@@ ete ) in the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . add ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift Ins@@ ert ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current mark .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders can not appear in the file structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you need to update changes to these options to update the folder with the update function . )
there are only entries indicated that have the differences . even if the target folders can not be copied to the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after coll@@ ision . ( the behaviour is plug@@ ged in a later program version . ) This option is shut down in the default settings .
note buttons to choose from the source with label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding windows are attached to the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) , if the lines are already available , click on the button accordingly .
by default , this option is de@@ activated . difference in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a preview of all virtual working surfaces . it &apos;s quite convenient to see the running programs on working surfaces to stop them or shift them . this works both within a desk than in several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops and the running applications . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to other .
with the medium @-@ mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desk and other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on it , where the right mouse button is clicked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; if , however , the context menu will only be clicked on the symbol and the name of the application , as well as entries , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and sending . the commands are the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of desktop . appears only when click on an application .
sends the application to selected virtual desktop . appears only if you click on an application .
if this check box is marked , window can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces can be moved .
when this field is crossed , the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager will be shown in the name of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops .
cross the field can be crossed the &amp; p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . is to be crossed with name , will be named with ordained names , &amp; eg ; 1 . Desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background each desk is also displayed as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when the field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ space will be displayed to enable the selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard symbol and graphic map shows a small view of real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , such as p@@ ager applications appear in some other windows ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual working surfaces in a horizontal and vertical in a vertical series , which is very well suited to the side of the desktop on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can display in the size to display the window as symbols or with their content and it runs outside the Control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selecting from switch to switch ... lets the dialog for Settings will appear .
currently this can &apos;t be changed in the dialog for Settings .@@ You can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you have no write permission for the file , you need to register as a user root or enter your system administrator to your system administrator . in this file you need to register the key win@@ dow@@ transparent mode and indicate that value . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse provides a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive coupling syndrome ) and which each mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse provides a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people suffering from pain . additionally , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is able to handle the pain when clicking the mouse , and helps cause many people to cause the computer without pain . unfortunately , you suffer from pain that use your computer when using your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it once more clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should avoid pain that causes the mouse to be created with the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by the mouse because of the mouse , use it as well as for all the ergonomic support .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click , as soon as you break the movement shortly .
if the intelligent shift is activated , making &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after the pressing of the mouse button . move it up to the end of movement , before the bat@@ ter requires a little exercise , but you get used to get rid of it fast .
this residence time must be sufficient after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click brings you .
if the shift is switched on , the rotary controller is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting , before the mouse button is waiting , before the mouse button appears once again , if there is no need for the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the clicking through mouse button . if this function is activated , a slow down to the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow handle is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / m@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but it can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can move it &amp; k@@ de ; at this time , take the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to sound &amp; multimedia , choose the sound system and there the rider General . there is a sliding buffer of sound buffer , which you can set up a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start by &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please send the relevant documentation to find out how to launch a program automatically .
sets all the settings on the values which have been set when opening the dialog . already , when opening the dialog , you have already pressed the button users to reset the settings according to the last pressing of users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially , use the default settings . in particular , smart shi@@ fting should first be switched off . if you have to acc@@ ust@@ omed to the automatic mouse , you may later use the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds .
first you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window , that doesn &apos;t display link , does not bring to un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . you can also park the mouse to such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is printed , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s normally quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . as it happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse . it should be quickly clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the Loch@@ es , where the ball was used . the dirt and the so@@ iling can easily cr@@ ater with a flat blade or fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
in very rare situations , the operating system starts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just started an im@@ min@@ ent building . in this case , it means the intelligent shift , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not cause any more to end the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue to work .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to perform mouse click and put the cur@@ sor into another passage .
work@@ around : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there you want . but if you don &apos;t want to make your mouse on a neutral area of your desktop , if you don &apos;t like to make any key mouse click un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . safe zones for mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menu and the cover lines of windows .
I try to work with an intelligent shift , but I do not create it to edit text .
intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating is a advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board , and to move into any other action , where you will probably prepare your mouse over the pressed mouse button . here are some advice about it :
use the intelligent shift if you just need to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; for example , select text instead as follows : perform at the end of the text area , and hold the switch @-@ down button pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button appears again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always see when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is played , the mouse button presses the sound like a mouse button . later you can use the intelligent shift even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires little exercise .
in order to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window has to be installed . this should be the case in most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeakers are set up properly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is a mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter was per@@ ched . this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and to which the patient under@@ stands pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool can also be configured that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling step before the mouse button is left out . in this way also the pulling and dis@@ lay with the mouse can be carried out .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows users to talk to your computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; m@@ ute users can talk the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the phr@@ ates phr@@ ases which should be spoken once again .
on the first side of the Assistant ( left screen photo ) , enter the command , which later used for the speech output of text . more details can be found in the description of the directory catalogue .
on the second side , select the default text@@ book . from the text@@ books you can often choose the lyrics , without having to insert it . the passages applications can be processed .
on the third side ( right screen photo ) determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ nal language . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can retri@@ eve the voc@@ abul@@ ary with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , with only correct letter recorded words into the word .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and essentially includes a input field for the key@@ presses of your phr@@ ases ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a circul@@ ating memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; properly set up , you can enter the phr@@ ases which you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the circul@@ ating memory . you can choose from these phr@@ ases which are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; insert ... open the setting dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog box contains two card cards , speech output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ nal , and the side K@@ TT@@ SD voice service .
in the input field of the card ticket type , enter the command to enter the Voice Command . in the check box below the input field , set the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be further improved as parameters , and you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to speech output from your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples are here in the app@@ endix .
as a language service we will use &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text into the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the need for a standardis@@ ed interface is a &amp; k@@ de ; d@@ us@@ on , der &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output and is currently not installed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action , in selecting a text passage , you will determine which action is triggered by the key@@ word or by selecting a text passage in the text@@ book text@@ book or in the l@@ ath for text@@ books .
with the selection of So@@ on , the chosen text passage will be directly addressed directly and in addition to the Select @-@ System . by selecting into the input field the chosen text passage will initially be entered into the input field .
with the second selective closing of the text@@ book for text@@ books you can define whether the text@@ book book can be stored automatically when closing the editing pane .
with the selection of text pass@@ agen@@ buch , the book is saved . if you choose any changes , the text @-@ fit book will not be saved . select before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text @-@ fit book is to be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ ab@@ brevi@@ ation includes a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ nal . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list includes more than a dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary to be used .
with buttons on the right you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries or export the order of books , or export them to a file . below the list , you can adjust the language and the language for the dictionary .
for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ not ; documentation one . the frequency of the single words is simply determined by adding the occurr@@ ence . in addition , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , in order to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries are mer@@ ging , and how these weights are to be taken .
with this option you will feature a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re @-@ issued words automatically in the dictionary , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abul@@ ary throughout the time .
the main section of the window to the handling of text@@ books is divided into two . in the upper part , the text@@ books are represented as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding keyboard guide . if you have selected a text@@ book guide , you can only change its name .
actions like new passages or books , or choose books , or select books , choose either through the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a hing@@ ed menu .
the sequence of text@@ books and text pass@@ ages you can change by pulling with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button change .
the chosen text is cut and copied into cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , the otherwise the selected areas of the engine storage is used .
the chosen text is copied to cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , the otherwise the selected areas of the engine storage is used .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is located in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected sets of the engine storage .
this menu entry is crossed by buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged by default on the Edit windows directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the refined left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another spot .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow border in the lower part of the main window with references to the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated if not crossed , this status bar will be blo@@ ated .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ dable support for text matches are displayed with entries . by clicking on the Edit windows directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the refined left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another spot .
probably you have the command to enter your language output correctly or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; insert the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the card card voice . ( see setting dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer . )
Festival is a speech output system of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are supported . the license allows to use festival for free and distribute without restrictions .
in order to show a command of command line for setting the language output , it is believed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / Festival . command to language output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written speech generator . currently it only supports the English translation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and distribute without limitations .
in order to show an example of the command line for the setup of language output , it is believed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the directory / usr / local / fre@@ ad . speech output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option needs to be switched on . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . he converts a list of Phon@@ ograph@@ s into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to break the text into phon@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax would like to be the last sign of the text , so that an additional character must be added , therefore the full command is more elabor@@ ate than in other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / m@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ disks / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a row . the option data must be turned on .
the output @-@ dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language support which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed by SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since the adjustment of the voice will only be carried out in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service which is installed in the setting dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and naturally &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak any text by the calcul@@ ator . a list is already saved by a sample that can always be made new editions to the user .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer includes . on the machine a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; moves ; further , if the field output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if the check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appear automatically in the system area of the control bar , it appears again as soon as the reading is finished .
with buttons in this series , you can start to break text orders , pause and hold back .
with buttons in this series you can read the latest text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or a text file to read , and you can also change the speaker for an order .
click on users or OK then all the settings are taken on all sides .
the card ticket orders will be displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . in order to initi@@ ate K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card card added to the D@@ TT@@ SD card ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if it should be read , and select the text that should be read before . after a short time the language output should start .
it is almost always meaning@@ ful to select the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ing and other invisible brands will also be read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . check first if you want to read , and then select the text that should be read before , and select the language menu . then , the language output should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate . embedded in other applications like &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Quant@@ a ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you have informed about the specified events . you can read the text of this news on &amp; ts ; read the text of this news .
in &amp; conversation ; I@@ RC program from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can send a message in different types of messages . for example , you can send a message if your nick@@ name is displayed . you can then read the I@@ RC message text in the I@@ RC channel .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ notice is distinguished here depending on the application .
filter for drawing screens provide a good way to correct ; unt@@ rue , or bug @-@ spoken messages , which is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b out of the news , the mail address , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since that in most cases can be assumed . read it also .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filter is not necessary .
in filters , text will be processed , before he is sent to program the program for non @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful to select any spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select a right speech or ab@@ brevi@@ ations or to circum@@ vent certain defects of speech synthesis and their voices .
in order to understand the working of fil@@ tering , it is important to know how the program &quot; Camera @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; distingu@@ ishes among four types of texts .
the edition of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be preferred to all other orders and hold these orders . if the edition of the screen readers will be read , the orders will continue resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings are the next priority . this level is important news , such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
News have a better priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can be used . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you just the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages are also news . read this .
the rest are simple text applications . each order that you get from the Card card jobs , is a text contract . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that are dedicated to text applications . text orders are meant for the issue longer term texts that possess any special man@@ ing@@ ness .
all four order types are re@@ worked in qu@@ eu@@ e , with the exception of the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just such a reads , this issue will be stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied on normal war@@ nings , news and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages .
filter process the text and enter it on the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filter are available as modules . in the future , there may be more types of filters in the future .
replacing a text substitute parts of text by other text . the set @-@ up parts can be shipped either as words or regular expres@@ sions . it will be supplied with pre@@ defined string ch@@ icks such as : - ) through text or by mail ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better under@@ stand@@ able shape .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; generated by a format into another format . in scope of supply &amp; box ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with subscri@@ ber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of text , or depending on the program that has the text to &amp; ts ; sent to a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ s. read about it .
each of these different filters have set the rules , after which it will be applied for a language output . if the filter does not establish its rules , he gives the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text contract , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fication on &amp; ts ; sent it through all activated filters that were set on the side below . the processing of the filter takes place in the order from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filter . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be used by top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following types of setup dialog .
in case you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison sample . these samples are found in the text , then the text will be replaced with the same replacement text .
enter your name for your filter . you can choose any name , it must be different from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the character strings in the column line and replaces him in accordance with the character string from the column . the list is shown in the quoted order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , download the current list , or delete a list of file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is registered , the filter is only applied when the spokes@@ man speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to select a list of languages . you can also select a list of languages if you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , mail
the user @-@ ID running programs receive you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers must be we@@ dge . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the user @-@ ID head @-@ 34@@ 32 shows you can only copy copies .
the character set filter will only be applied to the text if all the conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen is used when all input fields is empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in case of words used in the character set of regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ . ( s ) , the words must be limited to both sides ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will find no guide to write off regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; check boxes &amp; # 160 ; check boxes &amp; # 160 ; check boxes &amp; # 160 ; check boxes &amp; # 160 ; check boxes in the package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ duc@@ ted &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such changes . it can only be installed on a well @-@ form@@ edness XML . the auxiliary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
specify the path to the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the microphone selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card card . you can define that texts by mail from a female voice should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; there is a text to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker takes place using the speaker , which gives the program the text of &amp; ts , and the characteristics of the speaker card spokes@@ person . with the spokes@@ person , you can write the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; check boxes installed , you can call this with one click on the button to obtain help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of character string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here the characteristics of the desired service device . if the text had been shown above the filter conditions , the speaker will be selected to view the desired requirements at the eh@@ est . click on the button to view the dialog box message .
use these buttons to save or delete your spokes@@ person settings or delete all settings .
the microphone selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply if necessary . you must have to enter at least one condition .
the language output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give up their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , added to the language syn@@ thesizer up to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section includes a short description of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface the speech output API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / L@@ ent@@ y.@@ k@@ de.@@ org ) .
applications require voice services via the &amp; Bus ; -@@ Interface by &amp; k@@ de ; from the programme to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
there is text of text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you will give
open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . launch a window in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Modi@@ fication filters , but when using the module for the festival websites are not read in .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone that doesn &apos;t work even if you do not use this voice to read out websites . do not make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or signs indicate errors caused by syn@@ thes@@ izers , so that whole propositions are coated or only Kau@@ der@@ wi@@ sch . what can I do against that ?
make sure that the character encoding is set on the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or dic@@ tion@@ aries , these may possibly be fixed by a string collector filter . see .

KT@@ TS works with each voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in one &amp; console ;
the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , please refer to the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ops ; , according to information that are not yet included in this manual .
the program &quot; A @-@ disper@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to extend &amp; to extend the use of any other syn@@ thes@@ izers , use the development team in connection .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; iling , you need a current development environment from K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages , and the development files for the program &quot; Auto @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; ts ; from the source code for k@@ de@@ . you have downloaded Tar@@ ball created , translate and install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; check first if possible on @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher with your language syn@@ thesizer . for this purpose , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ ar SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program allows the program of air disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g should be further developed so that the device of non @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text will be dis@@ assembled in individual sets . the user may re@@ tire or ab@@ dic@@ ate , repeat the output or cancel the output .
if an application is available on &amp; kt@@ ops ; for example , if you have set up a spokes@@ man for the output , for example , if you have a speaker , whose language is female and whose family is female , this is automatically the best matching speaker . if you choose to read more about it , see how &amp; kt@@ ts , see you in .
if you click on the card card spokes@@ person on adding , and that a speaker is displayed on the list or click Edit menu , the card card spokes@@ person is displayed on the list . for example , the module will be displayed in the interactive module for Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable program . when the path to the festival is contained in P@@ AT@@ H , you have to enter only festival .
select the encoding for text , which is handed over to Festival . with voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this setting will be made automatically . in general , the Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 will apply , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with this sli@@ der , you can adjust the volume , microphone speed and sound @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some kno@@ bs and can not be displayed , the chosen voice can not be displayed by you .
some votes like Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ Vo@@ ices will need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you load this check box , these quotes are already loaded when the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory usage ) the first set is faster .
if this check box is not selected , you still have no nar@@ rator ( or forgot to click on the user ) . see .
if this check box is marked with the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window will appear . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol m@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD is able to read a text as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is able to read or control the device .
here are all orders in the waiting list , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just worked set . the speaker ID is equal to the column ID on the card card speaker .
with buttons in this series you can choose a full @-@ trip in the order that is chosen in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of the settings ( even on the other cards ) and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be sc@@ aled down to the icon in the system section . click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system does not contain ; it is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card card Audio . see also .
there are only text orders listed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . further information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; find here .
here you can select the type of audio output . if a component can &apos;t be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops ; either without support for the appropriate audio module or kt@@ ops ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ ins@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output is to be used , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module , select here the PCM device . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal speaking speed . thus , these settings can be converted to the program SO@@ x .
click on the button to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to find out what device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this card card , you can set special actions which will always be executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; handles four types of voice orders :
the edition of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be submitted to all other orders and maintained these orders . after the edition of the screen readers will be read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have a better priority . this level is important news , such as &amp; eg ; processor is used too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can read messages . if you read &amp; eg ; just a long text on a web page , you can welcome with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless we welcome you to enter the room .
when a text contract is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ops ; the audio output into the qu@@ eu@@ e a .
this audio file is always played when a normal text mandate is interrupted . if both the introductory sound is active as well as introductory message , the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message .
the settings on this cardboard card apply only for normal text applications . for news , war@@ nings and spending from Screen Re@@ aders are there any special actions when it will be interrupted by a higher priority .
in order to read &amp; drop ; K@@ notice messages are ready to read , start m@@ tr@@ s@@ gr@@ . and click on al@@ erts . the boxes al@@ erts can be published .
mark this check box to dis@@ able the read of &amp; k@@ de ; this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and reads , reads no al@@ erts .
if this setting is marked , al@@ erts will be played on which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read .
use these buttons to add events or delete events . if you click Add Next button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message that the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events that are stated otherwise in the list are igno@@ red by &amp; dict@@ ts ; igno@@ red .
use this selection field to determine what &amp; kt@@ ops ; should be when an event hits : you have the following selection possibilities :
if you have chosen a custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter the characteristics of the desired microphone station . standard cho@@ oses the speaker that is displayed in the list on the card card spokes@@ man as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if the action is specified for a specific application , this is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of certain application . the last option is to carry the action , which was specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event all al@@ erts for the application standard ( all other events can &apos;t be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the button Save to save the settings for the al@@ erts in a file . the downloaded events will start with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard for voice recording . this standard contains stamps for the control of voices , the speaker of noise and pitch . also marks for the control of the language for example ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
there are currently support &amp; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or audio tracks in the festival configuration dialog does not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually identified very mon@@ ot@@ on@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filter and pun@@ c@@ tur@@ ally detection filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . this can start &amp; kt@@ ops ; faster with the preliminary plans , since only the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized , do not start or cancel , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support it directly .
here you can see the set of approval filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , a set of power detection filter is automatically set up . you can add the settings or add further set of action , but will not use these settings .
at the easiest way you will learn the setup of speaking selection by selecting . if you select the setup menu , please change some features and check how the spokes@@ person has changed . for example , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then , faster with the pre @-@ reading , since only the first proposition must be processed , and not the whole text block that can last very long ,
you can then keep text contracts on the card card or cancel , even if the syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set of proposition is automatically set up when you start reading m@@ ons for the first time . it cannot be removed only . change nothing at this filter , unless you do what you do .
the pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tab@@ ul@@ atory character ( Dec@@ imal number 8 ) to set spacing ( Dec@@ imal number 8 ) before fil@@ tering automatically from the text ) . note that the default pro@@ positi@@ onal approval filter ret@@ ains the drawing .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ . ) , al@@ arms , messages , or the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders .
if you have a check of the normal movement detection filter , you can add this again by inser@@ ting the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
on the card card speaking , you can ski@@ p the intercom settings for application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card line speaker ) . with other words : no inter@@ mitt@@ ance features are set .
using the most suitable speaker , which has all the characteristics of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit it , cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise it cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise it cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ve ; the speaker that originally introduced the originally introduced properties .
select the method to enter the desired microphone features by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
please select the characteristics of the desired intercom . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter if this feature doesn &apos;t matter .
mark this check box when the complex should have priority to others . you can also set several markings .
since the language is a critical factor in default , it is always used as a priority feature . if you want to specify this feature , if you possibly want to specify a specific application text in another language than that in the working environment .
to use all the features in the speaker , which is located at the most likely to delete , click on the standard button and then apply to the speaker , which corresponds to the most likely below .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text reservation in the qu@@ eu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without the order number is the input 0 necessary ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ ons immediately crash@@ es when it is started . I have Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get back tra@@ ce@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and f@@ umes . probably you have to register G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved yet . if the problem is not solved , may be a not compatible version of g@@ amer . you can try g@@ amer or un@@ install g@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA is not working if I play at the same time with another application music . if I use a text contract , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ops ; a message that says : to open PCM .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts must occur in AL@@ SA to prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices . hin@@ ts for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected .
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed it and cannot use it in festival but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / Vo@@ ices . as a guide , you may serve the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice , to the developers .
on the card card Audio , there is a setting speed . that works , the program needs to be installed and above the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ thesis module such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are igno@@ red when &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is that the HTML code is turned into account . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .x@@ sl file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ change filter , and set the speech speed up .
I create it not that web pages are read with a female voice . I created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 , the day S@@ able Gender seems not to work . that the festival has not produced no error , the X@@ SL file for converting SS@@ ML according to SA@@ BER the Gender Tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I added an own character set filter and now I can finish in &amp; kt@@ ve ; do not appear anymore - or go back . on the cart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites orders will appear , the contract there is only one sentence . what do I do wrong ?
use the inter@@ marks ( point , fra@@ mark , excl@@ amation mark , compass , and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . do not use filters for this sign instead a filter for pro@@ positi@@ onal im@@ itation .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is already installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected )
note in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure the modules for g@@ amer is registered by calling the G@@ ST register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ op@@ .org )
some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music simultaneously and read a text read , and then you will start a further order . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the site of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still supports no real breaks . if you hold a text@@ box in &amp; kt@@ ops ; the current set will still be read @-@ in .
the audio program SO@@ x is used for the general setting of the microphone speed but otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ x with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install SO@@ x . the program is available on most &amp; Linux ; CDs are already included .
if you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; when Tar@@ ball ( with t@@ ar ge@@ ared Archive ) downloaded , sign up as normal user and un@@ pack the Tar@@ ball into a matching folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts is likely to be removed , probably or at least only on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thesizer are created by default . some of them have a run @-@ time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of Deb@@ ian distribution ) . configure the column configuration option to switch to the settings of the replacement .
as default , &amp; can be installed . this folder is not listed in / op@@ t / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = objective . for example
on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local , the right folder for programs which can be translated from sources .
CD k@@ de@@ . echo pres@@ ts@@ d &gt; IN@@ ST @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ e@@ fil@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd player make su make install
before you are using &amp; t , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust noise , microphone speed and pitch .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are supplied with festival . would you like to read our web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) Voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of festival . the German votes are subject to limitations on the transfer .
this voice uses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in a early development stage . extract the software in Film / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you need to set for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually contained in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . look for the festival first to the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you like to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit cy@@ c@@ lical such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes the le@@ x@@ ic@@ Australian analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; generated from it the audio output . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; program and the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; generated language out of di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this slide phone . Festival creates this by &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; you can generate this by &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; you can also generate di@@ ph@@ s. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be used from German text slides . more information can be found .
with this procedure , additional W@@ ra@@ pper code will be added to the Festival to use &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ votes for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ voting files are not installed in &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ folders are installed , but in the folder / lib / . instructions below
I@@ MS English Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; voices . it is required either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; then download MS English Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file system that you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 is the entry of the error correc@@ tions not necessary , you need to translate only festival new file ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ s@@ cm .
( Voice location &quot; German _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Male , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; ) ( Voice Command &quot; German _ de@@ 3 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; )
on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fest@@ ival@@ .@@ s@@ cm . add the right path to / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / . at the time of creating this hand@@ book work the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German festival .
this procedure uses special code to give the language about the festival with a Czech &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; vote and install at first festival and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; and ensure that both will work . then download festival Czech by
un@@ pack the program with t@@ ar in a suitable folder and create a enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia . the exec@@ utable festival must be in your P@@ AT@@ H .

Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ ty voice syn@@ thesizer , which currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with even suff@@ iciently stim@@ ulating quality . with &amp; ct@@ ance , you can either adjust pitch rate at this language either .
fl@@ ite is usually contained in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions and so you &apos;re looking back as the first to the CDs of your distribution .
h@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage voice syn@@ thesizer that works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates into the sound . the language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . you can set voice , pitch , microphone speed and volume over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr .
download at least a German language file from the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ page and un@@ pack them with un@@ zip in the folder / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la .
copy the t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the date .
on the card card set , select a voice and set the paths to &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
ep@@ och@@ s is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff @-@ syn@@ thesizer for Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with even suff@@ iciently stim@@ ulating quality . you can only adjust the volume with this syn@@ thesizer .
you can start the t@@ ms@@ g on the card menu . if the ep@@ och programs are not available in your P@@ AT@@ H , you can enter the path to your programs on the card card . enter an additional parameters for the programs . enter in one &amp; console ; ep@@ ic -@@ h or say -@@ h to obtain further information .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ ty voice syn@@ thesizer , which was written in &amp; Java ; i.e. , you need to install &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can &apos;t adjust sound @-@ level , noise level .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ops ; with any syn@@ thesizer that can be controlled in one &amp; console ; it can be controlled on the command line .
at best use a command that writes the language output to a temporary audio file ( wav ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which enables the administration of network interfaces , of the rout@@ ings and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center can be called by selecting K Menu bar contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same manner as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ man ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selection of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install any physical devices and their drivers have already been fully operational and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device includes and the setting of the network features .
in most cases drivers for the network hardware and other devices are added when installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up . network appliances later added , the driver must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version .
the module network settings will be up@@ loaded if the network settings are selected in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is chosen . starting the module settings I tried to detect the connected platform at the system automatically .
if the platform is not recognized , the proposed selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose the distribution and the release of the best . by expl@@ oring the adjustment of non @-@ re requests , the definition cannot be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be set automatically .
changing the network settings can only be displayed in system management mode . in advance , all options are gray , meaning that the settings can only be viewed . in the system management mode , it is necessary due to clicking the button mode at the right end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password mode .
in the system management mode the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces is used to manage network appliances . all available network machines are displayed . the network interfaces can be carried out from the rider network interfaces :
setting up the settings can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface ... in the dialog box can be processed .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the dialog for incoming orders to proceed .
with the option Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are collected by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start , therefore no more setting required . in the list box can be selected either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system .
with the selection manual , no DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be made available for TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be noted in the input field IP address .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alize the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values given in this dialog will be displayed as Properties of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP address . you can identify if the requested address is already in use . in doubt the network administrators should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off . turn on an switched network device is enabled by selecting from the list and click on interface .
networking devices may be activated or switched off . switch off one activated networked device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking from interface to dis@@ able ....
the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ network .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway is selected .
one machine with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address . that is necessary because computer can only understand IP addresses . if you use ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org does not resolve this name into an IP address like about 12@@ 3,@@ 67@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution of the e@@ quest@@ rian name resolution enables simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed .@@ DNS entries can be arranged by selecting a entry and up or down in the list with buttons on or down in the priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group computer to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be displayed the new name server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group Calcul@@ ator for the name resolution , select one entry and then click on the button .... It will appear dialog for Dialogue .
the list of well @-@ known computers describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily on bo@@ oting , if no DNS server are available . in small , closed network drives , it can replace DNS server .
normally , the list well known hosts lists some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses still support . this is still in the previous version of IP is to replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The dialog for New alias is displayed .
in order to enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the well known hosts has several alias names , add buttons adding several times , and enter the alias name .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog for Edit Calcul@@ ator is displayed .
it can run one of the following tasks , then with click OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings used in the module settings are no effective immediately in the system . to enable the change , must be set in one &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ mo@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , where you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of the binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one &amp; console ; using rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with graphical surface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not sufficient , but additionally , the development packages with libraries and others will be needed .
this is not only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology will be discussed , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; configuration files will be discussed .
this area cannot replace more information about IP networks . in this app@@ endix , only basic information on the integration of the PC can be convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . IPv4 5 has never found great spread . from IPv6 there is no major spread over the near future . therefore , this description focuses on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge that the IP address of a network interface is as@@ ible . on &amp; eg ; Work@@ station is the network administrator to be used or , if available , DH@@ CP can not simply be chosen individually .
when putting a own small ( home ) network the IP address should be chosen from a specially designed range for this purpose to avoid IP address settings with the global ( Internet ) network . addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made by setting a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks mostly addresses in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large for networks up to 250 computers large enough .
in addition , the mask m@@ asks usually will be reduced to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all calcul@@ ators are on the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 04 ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called Standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP @-@ line .
the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed in DSL connections , so it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections a different content is set to be found there .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is well known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another status as expected is expected .

&amp; dat ; is a security program for tape drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a band . the first goal was to create a surface for t@@ ar , the second purpose was the answer to a question that asked my wife : how much longer takes it when you sec@@ ures ?
before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; it may happen in three ways :
if the band returns and reads the pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information of the tape . det@@ ects and k@@ dat ; the fall@@ back on the band will not be asked if the band will be format@@ ted .
recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the leader , search for the matching index on your plate . can &apos;t be found if the index index is new to be created .
everything has gone smooth , changes the symbol for the tape drive to indicate that the band is mounted . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the tape .
prior to the throw of the belt , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to do this .
as a result of a change in symbol for the band , the integration could be solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be cast without risk .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted from &amp; k@@ dat ; format@@ ted .
a band of band must be format@@ ted before you can use the formation of data . this process does not need to be format@@ ted with &amp; k@@ dat ; this process must be done before using the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted before using the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; flo@@ ppy tape drives usually do not require a form@@ att@@ ing of the tape , D@@ AT drives on the other hand .
after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; all the data on the band are lost , all the data on the band is lost automatically ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process , the band is automatically eng@@ ined and is ready for use .
before you encounter the backup process , you must choose to choose the files that are done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or the folder is secured .
mark a safe profile in the tree . only the files are secured in the profile .
select files in the local file tree with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or folders will be secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu .
once the backup is entered , the dialog for backup is opening up . in this dialogue , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears to backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archive in the entry for the drive . it is checked only the selected file or the folder .
select the files in one of the archive in one of the entry for the band with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the test procedure has started , the dialog for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection once and change the folder to review .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears to check out the progress of the test process as well as data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initi@@ alize the restore , the files that are to be restored , may be marked on two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry of the tape drive . it will be restored only the selected file or folders .
select the desired files from one of the archive with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or folders can be recovered .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu bar ....
once the restore procedure has started , the dialog for Rest@@ oration . in this dialog , you can check your selection once and change the folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears to restore . this dialog displays the progress of recovery process and the remainder of the time .
sometimes it shows itself as necessary to create the tape index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this is created a secure profile with the straight marked files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a secure profile :
the current work@@ folder in which the backup should be carried out . the list of files will be updated automatically according to the selected work@@ folder .
for all the folders that are listed under backup files , only those files are saved on the same file system , such as the folder . file that can be found on other file systems , you can use separately under backup files . each entry is independent of t@@ ar independent from the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is secured . only the files have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup is used .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling the t@@ ar . this causes all files to be secured and created a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files ; s ; and lt ; l@@ apping ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the complete path for the tape drive for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape tool .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is bound to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations .
if the option is enabled , it tries to lock and try to lock off the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work with all band drives .
if the option is switched on , when trig@@ gers the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the tape automatically dis@@ closed . use this option not with flo@@ ppy streaming .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; dat ; the hardware @-@ related block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to use &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your belt drive .
if &amp; dat ; a band is format@@ ted , writing a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only be one memory block on the band . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this character is us@@ ername : seconds , whereby the name of the complete name of the system is format@@ ted on which the band has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number seconds that has been format@@ ted by the ep@@ och in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to use a file named in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the band are pure t@@ ar -@@ archives that can be administ@@ rated directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar . even more t@@ ar versions should work , as long as it is not for incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the contents of a backup tool . this symbol is only active if a tape is mounted .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , where you can obtain information on your system or where the system allows you to obtain information about your system or , for users with fast access , for example information on problems that occur on their server .
&amp; n@@ Systems log ; helps users to understand what your machine makes in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information on your system or where the system is stored in the different protocol files .
in addition , it allows key system log ; experienced users to perform quick access , for example information on problems related to their server . it therefore tries to provide some advanced functions , with which help the protocol files can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; C. Systems log has a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of protocol files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition and will be explained in further chapters of this hand@@ book .
as you can see in the following screen photo , the login system log is made available , with their help you can easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sor@@ ting and fil@@ tering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; try system log ; first attempts to open the system protocol - it will not be displayed , and it opens instead of its small message window , so you &apos;ve found &amp; ks@@ ystem log . the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually do not own per@@ missions for reading .
you can also use the filter bar to filter the selected filter bar . in addition , the list box is displayed next to the filter bar . in addition , the list box is displayed next to the filter . in addition , a protocol line will be displayed only when in one of the columns you find the character string of the filter search term .
you can also select any other entry at this point . in addition , the string of the filter search term is then drawn only with entries in accordance with selected columns . then , for example , in the filter bar code , select the login page log ; all protocol lines that were sent from this process or created .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a displayed color as protocol lines of Level Note . the color display of protocol lines may be switched off .
if you want to display only certain process ( for example in system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process as you would like to examine the issu@@ ance of a certain command as for example to the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter bar .
in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to allow all new added protocol lines to be displayed .
the login system log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate under@@ stands . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub@@ windows and manage . as soon as you have selected a window , select a protocol for displaying the menu .
&amp; n@@ Systems log ; has its own website to ht@@ t@@ p : / / ks@@ Systems log@@ .@@ forum @-@ sof@@ tw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ .@@ D@@ ort you will find further information about the supply of the log system log .
and log &apos;s log ; also will be found in the following folder of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion @-@ Archive : ks@@ ystem log ; see &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it editor , rather well known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v .
the system V In@@ it rapidly evolved to the standard for control of the program starts at the start of the system in the &amp; Linux ; and because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD option .
I will not go on historical aspects here ( among others because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone might try to introduce a machine on System V in@@ it , without a new installation and re @-@ format . therefore , you must be sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was there one .
the SY@@ SV in@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ .@@ D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ no@@ it and following a further folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole set of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service which you would like to start reading system or change to another run@@ level . system services include such items such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services include not such items such as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie down among / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the standard run@@ off level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see line like the following in the initial segment :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre @-@ set run@@ level 3 . if you want to change at the in@@ itt@@ ab changes , then you can repair anything , then you will repair it by rest@@ oring the system and run the following :
but how does it begin to enter all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this file . instead , each entry is a link to a scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written that it is an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start scripts from hand on the command line like this :
this would keep the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called with the argument . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument .
some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I may have &amp; eg ; a server running level , that can run ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; you could also have a user level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to tri@@ vial to tri@@ vial : draw a entry out of the field of availability system services to one of the six round level to run it on this level ( or stop or stop ) .
you can move the scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or modify the position within a level . this is the entry from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this happens only if it occurs an entry from the field of availability system services .
note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed , if you have to move this into a new zone if you only need to select copying from the menu click or from the context menu -- even if the next entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sor@@ ting number of an entry may not be calculated sometimes . in such a case you need to edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to in@@ ert system service .
note : there is no possibility to restore the entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the various work ranges ( Available , run@@ level 1 Start , run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection - or below the previous one .
to move one entry into another round level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired round level by inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of one entry manually , press the tab button to switch between different fields . use the tab button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the risk of data loss require all entries in the menu file a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c ) is taken if it is available . otherwise , they will be saved from &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v . changes to the default settings are stored in a local ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard lap@@ tops , and now the machine starts continuously new . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ m@@ pt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; for execution using run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way , such as system services are started , simpli@@ fies the configuration for propri@@ etary investments in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v are planning to extend the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check whether all configuration files are required ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) are just retri@@ eved without a message if your configuration files are not available or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; level varies from Distribution to Distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send us more information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made any changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or entry deposit in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user list . to Edit you select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog for user or group features .
some card cards are displayed only if you have expanded system settings . only if you are enabled by expanding system settings , a card card will appear on which you can make individual settings if you are shadow @-@ pass@@ words or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD univers@@ ally .
the card card pass@@ wor@@ ms appears , if shadow pass@@ words or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , as installed in BSD / Unix .
this card card appears only if for at least one integrated file system limit ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters in case of any user .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system .
the Card card groups informs you about the group sen@@ ities of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the prim@@ itive group . furthermore , the user can join in other groups by choosing these in the big field .
the dialog box features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select from the menu users or group or click on the matching Add button of the tool@@ bar . the Edit menu or Del@@ ete of the selected group or the selected group works analog .
with this module you can add the L@@ ILO boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to boot from the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change , change , and more .
