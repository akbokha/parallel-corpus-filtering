<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be quickly found about your location. if you have enough photos, you will use underfile such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; you will then publish a folder for images that you can print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files and you will not want to organise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files are together? the separation of file types makes pile processing easier. cut new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplifies the backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived document.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend using the metadata option in the Settings page of metadata in & digious; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forgot this, you can subsequently select the metadata from the database in the files by using the corresponding item.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change? to them make a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you need to select all photo words, inscriptions and a review. of course, you can then select all the images that the same attribute need and then set the value. that makes sense, as you can concentrate on the best photos when you want to concentrate on the best pictures.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now let us go with keywords, keywords, how you can use other programs frequently, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloged pictures from another source of embedded words, then the picture will be put into the correct place for you. if the image of the Hierarchy is no problem and can easily be done by moving one undertree to another. the implied words are done by & digious; updated while keeping the signatures.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata excels. this is a very large representation, because each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data features properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the words - the next section refers to intoxications or comments, the third important tool for your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to just see most of your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they're sure to how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from afar there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider it closer look at some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this is the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the french Normandie 60 years after landing. Wow! one starts to dream, memories, the historical period is back again, you may perhaps have changed your perception of this panoramic position completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other photos consider the title may be more important than the picture themselves to generate a interest. if you have pictures, the key is to transfer it to the viewer, to help Him to help you understand what you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's okay, when an image is not perfect if it has only effect with a lettering for themselves alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digious reviews, you can also use a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8). if you have exported your pictures in web galleries, then these labels will be exported to your requirements into the labelling and / or the title of web-Galery system. so you have to tell the story about the opening of a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? it wasn't Earth not a boring planet before GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train departs of the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of the Geolocalisation are already innumerable and are still deeper into the future. I can also use KML files that you can virtually open your trips through images with geographic data. you can also view the pictures on the recording location. you can also export your trips to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also applicable in all versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information is done in the direction of & digiplug; as information is deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for writer and Writer): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographer, for example, if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, then it cannot be changed. this field does not support commercially nor Semikolons as a divideness.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autonize (synonym for the editor): associated with the author. examples of this field contains the work number of photographers. examples may be title as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a vermery that has to be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): do you use the bidder box to identify who the photo. if the photographer has been listed below Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a warehouse photo, then here the group / agency does not offer the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important the author and copyright chapters, although this does not provide protection against abuse. everyone who has no protection against abuse, can delete or change the solution for this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique for each image. it takes place in the near future, a module for staple processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: turntable, turnaround, ECC, transmission error, aging of storage media, restore, redundancy, desastness, temperature, data size, widespread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire. these kind of losses are the same which can also happen with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics that causes a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to tackle the problem of CDs / DVDs, these must be treated more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives that are longer getting more difficult and much more expensive. there are deals on gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 that can claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. if you believe it is in your account room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you are good disks and good recording tools are not much more expensive than the cheapest one, but you write a lot more reliable than the cheapest one. it turns the right to select the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for errors, even if you have just returned only. therefore, they use a control box mechanism to protect himself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the remainder we needed for the formatting, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">There is a reasonable program called Iso Buster for faulty CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications that corrupt data from damaged disk disks, disks, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything is said of course also available for the Blu-ray Disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good reception quality on top quality media in a non-proprietary format. also read the media with a description, date & author license and then stored on a clean, dark dry and in animals protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that this media can read.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discourse manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers guarantee a new disk, but not the data. Google introduces a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: disfailed.</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: disks stay at the longest if you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In lower temperature results, the most frequent troubleshooting, SMART cannot notice this error. some of SMART noted this error. some of SMART showed impending failure. this is especially Leszehler and publishing count. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">Here it is just about the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also save data loss due to a power loss before you have saved the files, but these losses are usually recovered without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices shocks not have a lot of power, that can cause severe damage on devices with computer chips and high-speed filters. these may cause severe damage, complete data loss, hardware difficulties, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from inevitable to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most widespread protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a tool that is a part of the energizer which absorbs and the rest is available. it is usually in the form of a plug-strip. remember that not each plug-bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should make sure that he also complies with UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a specific minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it protects the protection against flashes, which protects the correctly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since a voltage can use any cable to your computer, you should make sure that all peripherals connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers offer overvoltage support which also includes a phone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overload protection. a variety of these devices are especially developed for notebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. thus you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection system protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of indispensable data. therefore, it may be meaningful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Beside the protection against overlashings, these devices can automatically shut up your data when a power failures. this gives you the ability to save the system. if you need a UPS Store, you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like a overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifespan of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your host system is exposed to and compare his security with electricity problems with the cost to avoid these. a high-quality overload protection can be used for less than & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you think about how well your machines should be used. at the end, you always remember to trench all the cables before you drive to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use this as a drive under & Linux; for Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is a further popular offer with which you can save any quantities of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, compared to the hard drives, you are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is no general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com are available online storage services. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your images in full resolution online. for $25 per year you get unlimited memory, which should be reviewed in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the view of the data backup, web solutions are very secure. data errors are automatically included by the TCP protocols and for large companies in the offer a backup and a distribution memory. thus, they are deserted.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrate the elements of the transmission sequence in the calculator. all transfers are due to transmission error. the file system fs and btrfs make sure the data integrity between the operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody says when a transmission error occurred, not when it was in your hardware. all this disruptions remain unpleasant to have no protection. no one seems to have been thought to have. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more secure data base than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they produce interferences within data streams. in normal file systems this error remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems you should see in the future. as early as 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems appears to be one of two candidates. it's open source, with many patents and is available under one to the GPL uncompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon available for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its bundle file system. it is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms, and it is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">This is not underestimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in notebook and 46% at work bench systems. in notebooks, the proportion of thieves is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of the most. it leads to a lesser damage, such as theft or reinstallations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple user know only very few viruses and under & Linux; for long nobody has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less angling for data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems. here you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the time during an operation is higher and a definitive status is avoided. if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the largest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. commonly that the technology is further developed, there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and space characteristic for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are very deteriorated in the direction of 10 megapixels. even though this resolution is rather deteriorated for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorated. even DSLR cameras are ideal for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras are required for your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk drive you today for 100 & euro; so, do not use any other data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected by a plan and test this backup before you do something serious like the reinstallation of your operating system, replacing panels or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then a day when lightning strikes you, you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A Desaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forgotten aircraft activity: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect an entire room or complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desastening always means a non local storage. bring your backups up into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above mentioned above is a common basis for a data loss despite secure the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that are to be secured. it is a snapshot without the history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: one backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the latest differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. it can produce the original status at any time again. this backup occurs in a versioning system next with the exception that it is only geted and not progress.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that allows you to set up easily on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transferring scripts, remove only the difference of the files that really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back important images directly after you have saved on your computer on a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach will allow you enough time to discover losses and restore again. at the same time you will get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment intake for at least one month and a moment of moment should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPMP files, original, storage, scalability, media, reinvent pictures and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures survive the next 40 years, that is roughly the time period in which you are really interested in you because you remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unforeseeable due to its nature, you must be careful and evaluate it all over time. unfortunately, there is no other option than a certain gesture. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself as the current system is backwards compatible. the less variations are used in the past, so easier is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of detailed explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available today for anyone. if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, then store it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand the Council is quite simple: everytime you change your computer architecture, your memory and secure file format, you should review your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is to change a system in size for the possibility to change a system in its size. it actually has enlarge it.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you have produced the scalability with the plan and the area you want to enlarge it on a dedicated plate or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and locate it onto a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the command dmesg whether your new record was recognized by the system but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">N = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBps; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # changing the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day is no software you can read, then you can create these themselves. this task is simpler from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. they should therefore no longer use it.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard, but it can be much more. it can be lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG may need a relative many administration information, but not as many as JPG requires and a slow compression mode. this format we would like to save you for saving your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression algorithm (Deflate). however, a problem is however that this format of many people can be adapted. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital negative file format is a licensed and open source file format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the need for the need of camera data. a handful of camera manufacturers are already available, and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon also for some time.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mix of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to insert their data into a file itself. the file information will be saved with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers drag it before an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, usually stores. XMP will fit the metadata separately from the file file and the image file can be used. therefore, you should remember whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Community Metadata Initiative is an open organisation which support a wide range of purposes of purposes and business models. to the activities of DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and workshops, standard connections and explaining efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadats standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long the images on the camera hodium, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your resource archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layer processing, you can use external programs. if you add the images back with & digious; then you should add the metadata again. these have been cut by different programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital watermark. export them then in Webgaleries, encode you in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photo in & digious; in section add a photos to an album you can add a description, as you can already add on your hard disk, but the camera interface allows you to add many advanced settings for importing images to your album.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect this with the calculator, switch the camera to the display mode and switch them. another description can be found in the handbook of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, the camera tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a heel indicator appears at the lower end and the preview pictures of all photos on the camera will be displayed. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for each file, photos, movies, music etc on the camera will appear.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information about any entry. with the page features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a single entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays the file features and the photo information that are internally stored by the camera. a symbol indicates that the picture has not yet been downloaded on your computer. note that some digital cameras does not have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata like EXIF, manufacturer of information, GPS etc. these information are the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of & digious. note that these metadata are not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click to download and then download all photos from their camera to a single album in & digious;. for downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures have been downloaded in a album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired settings using the standard selection methods of & kde; as soon as you have selected the photos, use the button download and then choose selected from you until you have chosen some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is available for download. these pictures have been downloaded not yet from & digious; in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download all download or download files, a dialog appears where you can select the target album which can be stored in the photos. see the list of existent albums, like normal file, then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digious, you will load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you downloaded the desired photos you can delete them from the camera. you can only delete all at once, so you must select this first and delete them away from Delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way you have deleted from the camera, the photos will not be deleted from the trashcan of & kde; they should be carefully checked, if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera. if you have downloaded the camera's screen, you should make it much faster than the camera screen, since it is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filename for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are normally utilized after the photos of the camera have been deleted. this may be convenient, the date and time at which the picture was taken to integrate in the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring of the image and for date-based subtitles. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission will open three additional options that will be done before the photos on the plate are stored. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the EXIF information into the IPTC-fields. with the last option you can correct date and time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% H:% M:% S. switch to the reading date and time. for further changes, you should read the command stringtime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file names, you have the option to change the filename in lowercase. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digious system; for a photo, will be displayed below the name indicating the camera in preview. your settings can be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digious materials; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to perform an automatic rotation during the infuse. not all cameras are ready. in the section side bar metadata you can see further details, about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera didn't deliver this information, the photo in the original orientation. if you want the automatic turning off, use the button extension and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera takes information about the date, at which the photo was made available, you can download & digial; all images with the same date are loaded in the same subalbum. not all cameras are available in the same subalbum. not all cameras are available in the same subalbum. in the section page bar meta data you can consult which information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case it stores & digious; if you want to change this option, you will need to switch on this option. do not use the button based subtitles at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The simplest way to load photos from their computer to your camera is download. choose upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that can be uploaded. you can also select more than one file using the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digious; you, where the pictures are uploaded high. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select here the desired folder and press OK to upload the upload. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a common term in this document. thus, a position is meant that can be displayed in linear and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. identifying the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photography, it can be interesting to connect a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to enter an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you don't forget to open the photo, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digious user; users want to locate the location of the photos so that you can easily document the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how the GPS data is in the image? first you should know that exiv2 are supported many GPS data fields, such as the data into these fields? there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the correct hardware, using the KIPI module on the geographic assignment (manual) and most recently about manual input from known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit integrated, but there is a few that works with GPS receivers. either as card module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with psclone or gpsbabel only. you need to store these data in the GPX format, as it is the only format used by the geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlated data from pictures and GPS. on the following page, you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitudinal or other data, you can use this script that works using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the coordinates to be created e.g. from maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street cards. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">Digious tests; tried to give you much control over his work processes as possible. there are many settings that make the behaviour of & digious; to change in the menu settings, you need to set up in eight pages. you can change between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Action can also be displayed on embedded preview or imaging, so that the default behavior of & digious occurs, if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the column-didacy and copyright data. these data will be selected automatically in the respective IPTC data fields when you are written for downloading from the camera body. also in case of a database-polynchronous data, these data are written into the IPTC-fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autoritel is a synonym for editor: this field should be the professional name of the photographer. this may be a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a closer description of the authority must be also filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for provider: use this field to specify the photo. this must not be the author like this for a message agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here, then the group or agency should be placed on the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions save the data into the corresponding IPTC rock. this ensures that metadata are permanently included in the picture and not only available in the database of & digious; these metadata are also available and can be imported without lost without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images added as a embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments using the pictures embedded labels. attention: for pictures, which included intoxications, they are overwritten by the party's shots.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all options for information which appear when the mouse rests on the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is indicated or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digious support; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and digious formats. to determine which file types & digious result, you can add the file extensions on this list and remove any of these extensions; Albumordner, which has no such improvements, is ignored by & digious.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the visual brightness; can be set on this page to the default values. however, if you have different sizes and the synchronous mode, if you have different sizes and the synchronous mode, you should only use different sizes and the synchronous mode. if you have one, then you can receive a better visual results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select this here. you can use the toolbar when you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Overseas and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing, this picture mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling is meant that the pictures are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia about more detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting of PNG compressing, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not decrease the image quality because PNG has a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to high compression. thus, 1: a low and 9 has a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option of TIFF files you can compress the deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not have influence on image quality because the deflate algorithm is free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setup loss-free JPEG 2000 files, it can be free-free. even if you've been written the lossless setup, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JPEG. however, metadata was not yet supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digious versions, the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it was very fast on a tool to manipulating your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light as the pixel color of the CCD sensor. if you use this option, you solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option records a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic balance balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance, based on a white map which was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors, the use of the second sensors have the effect that shows more details in four steps more details in the fields. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top, so the parts of your camera are embedded in the settings, due to the inability of your camera, define a few fancy results because it shows the spelling in various Rosatönen. most recently, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the fields.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & flcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red proportions of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a matter how colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you want to reconstruct the option, you will get the possibility to set a level. here's a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminance value according to your taste. however, you probably need to set it somewhat higher than the default 1. but this may also be done later in the image options of the & digious; -processing. to keep the time for the deosaicing small, you should be preserved conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub-filtered image sensor, which provides many cameras and which is known as a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">Digious, and flcraw faces these three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like whether AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm created by Dcw. however, it creates colour artworks on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you're looking for a quick solution with acceptable results.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour tip of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as you are done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back. there are also LCMS and digiplug; information like the color space in the other to translate the colours as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior questions, if a painting is opened in the image processing / colour management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Download the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / home / user / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles. check this folder then during the start of the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have the possibility to deposit & quot; standard feed; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color does not manage the whole screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to monitor camera manufacturers and model which included. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain dclonal mapping or Gammaze correction. this means that you don't have to perform the tongs for conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options like the soft-proof-profile, with which you can emulate, as your printer can have a smaller paint area than your camera and some colors. this could be done manually, instead of seeing the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious that the color profile is what is foreseen for them. unfortunately, here is not a table of cameras and profiles fit here. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profiling allows the style to recognise the style: F for a precise style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for Portraitand S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image Plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & kde; imaging and image editing; many modules support which are written to work with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you can see a list of available modules. choose which you want to use, and these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main menu and additionally, you will find some also in the context menu of the menus.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks to be carried out by modules can be set manually in the menu under Settings short notice.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) via KIPI modules can be downloaded via the KIPI project via http: / / www.kipi-plugg.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the dip should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transfer, normally they are 4-5 seconds good. the other check boxes switch off the metadata that ends at the bottom end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left-hand side a list of all the cameras supported on the right. if you want to use a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use it, make sure that the camera is properly coupled, switched on and in the image format. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). this field is only active if you have a USB- or FireWire-mass storage center. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / comer, when you add your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To support your digital camera with & digiplug; you need to connect the camera to your computer, and turn it into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digious; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can choose any name for your camera. it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than a camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option dialog for shifting &gt; images to the trashcan display, you can set the conversation of & digious; when deleting a photos in a album. in the abbreviation of a photos and deletion of a album you can find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down by & digious; applied, if you apply the changes to the right side bar without any setbacks. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also attach the display of the welcome screen of & digious; in order to start, this will accelerate the start process of & digious conditions.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setup Beim starts to search for new photos and get the basis for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digious albums; if something has been removed from the base folder, ask & digious; ask if it is to delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemas can be used in & digious; used to customize the main window on your taste. these settings can choose from the toolbar code. a preview of available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in making a new design for & digious systems, you will find further information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">The digious work has a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and see the correction and improvement. image processing can be launched by a click with the left mouse button on the preview and selection of the entry menu entry / edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digious; they are not part of your distribution. more information about the KIPI modules are available in the section of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current date number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the tool bar for quick access to the most commonly required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The machining functions of the image processing changes your photos. however, no of the functions will be used to save the original photo, before you select File Save or button Save from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo, as soon as you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should order a copy of your picture before you change it. you can save with file Save as possible.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image, restore the image processing button in the toolbar. you lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last Save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of the image processing can be revoked or re-manufactured. the last action can be revoked, by clicking on the Reset, or restore editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you're using this, you should make the shortcut, Ctrl; -z to reverse and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you are using the & LMB over the rear or restore button in the tool bar, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu applications, all the actions are set between also on the reverse or reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have launched the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation boards in the toolbar, picture high, image nobelow or the entries in the menu file. if you made any changes in the current photo you will be asked if you want to back up.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can simply enter the photo in the photo, in which you can use Ctrl; mouse or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the safer menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen Mode displays the photo in full screen mode. if you don't want to use the Esc button. normally, you will also change the toolbar. if you don't want to change this inside the setting dialog of & digious; you can call it from the & digious cloth. see this section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can print the image file and obtain the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole phrases. all picture pages can choose from your selection. you need only select the pictures with the default methods and choose from the menu album Exporter print assistant. if you follow the wizard you will need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window, main window, has a page bar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation wall, also available in the image processing. it will be displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same riders lets the sidebar appear or vanish into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can enter inscriptions with unlimited size or add. note the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means all special characters are allowed in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated and special characters are converted to 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC labelling system in other applications, please note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it either you have either the button user or simply change to the next image, the labels will then be stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can always be done if you choose a metadata setting, which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can always be used with a single click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard breviations. to rate several pictures at the same time, choose this off and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC site, which follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword and a selection box with the previously made in this & digious; -session used keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is adjusted dynamically to those given keyword. you can easily restrict the number of possibilities to search for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many words.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is another relief when entering the keywords at a picture series. if you have put different words, they are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Passwords can be set in the tree by exploring the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all tags of a picture are stored in the IPTC site Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword, it's only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar keyword is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their record, - data, sample and viewport. if additionally one or more keyword filter is used from the right side, only the cutting quantity of these two are shown.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also pull them out and place them. if you have several pictures, you can move it with keyword. if the keyword is already exists, you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place on the selection. then a dialogue, you will ask if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window shows the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is selected on one calendar. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and afterwards a keyword from the right keyword was pulled onto the selection and put it there. a dialog will ask if this word is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will be held at each start of the program. it can also be switched on by Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created it and will notice that it would have one or to be, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and rules.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, after which is needed in the database, can be an album, name, keyword, picture, key word etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can choose e.g. a extended search over all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, just check the check box at the end of the rule and then to use the button groups. see the options as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to back the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this job. I was mainly adapted to & digial. s specific implementation was adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you can achieve a colored workflow from the colors or scanners, a predictable deviation from the camera or scanners, you can achieve the colors on your monitor from your camera, or scanners, and those colors that you can print or publish your colour from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes on colour management, then everyone wants to press the buttons he has to press for the results. unfortunately, this tutorial is to provide you sufficient background information about color management. additionally, you will help to make your own informal decisions to make your own informal decisions so that you want to obtain the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows have been listed below all six criteria, then you don't need to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They are calibrated on a monitor of the sRGB-color space. (further information please see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other captures are per e-mail or the web, where the RGB of the de-facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if the RGB works so well and the life for all so easy, why should I use another color space and do it to have thought about color photos?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the sounding of sRGB comparing to the colors that we can really see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the huenisenical region, and colors at the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB using some larger farms, please visit Bruce Lindblooms page and click on info and then to information about RGB working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to kiss my monitor when I decided to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB color space, or not, you need to monitor your monitor so that you are looking at a color space by sRGB. if you are working as a color space by sRGB, you must use either your monitor to the sRGB standard kalligs, a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections available, which can improve a picture in most cases. use it therefore before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, abequal, Automatic and contrast turn from the menu automatically correct Automatic correcting automatically attempts to make the best. they are experimenting with these effects, to see what works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize the leukin values beyond the entire picture so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its color shutter. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Abbot: this method adjusts the light amplifier of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity is the same number of pixels. sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces just a very powerful operation, which causes either marvel at a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic velling: this method maximizes colour range in red, green and blue channel. they determined the dark and bright borrow shades and adjusted the red, green and blue canals at the complete histogram.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrasts: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of a picture by postpone the lowest and highest values of all values in between. this is only visible when balanced pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digious occurs; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white balance of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance-correction is slightly limited there via a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you are able to perform far from the original image, if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your ways are to expire better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm based by Pawel T. Jochromas. you can restart it from the menu entry colors white balance sheet of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side are adapted both the original picture as well as the preview of the target image. if you want to see dynamically the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original whitish, then it is enough to click the bottom window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the finish photos has a red marker. the luminance of the Pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right above, a histogram is indicated that once you have changed a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in good illuminated pictures, most pixels will be very small Luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadows reills you to improve the shadow details of your photos or even down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Contact with the above-mentioned controls, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and then anywhere you to use the displayed color for calculating the colour temperature of the white balance. on this type the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overload indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pixels is overexposed. this will show the combined result in white balance. this is shown in preview as pure indicator and does not have a effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons Save as and store are precisely this. each setting of the white balance you have set to save this in a text file and load later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button settings sets all the filter values to its standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that the neutral settings can be obtained another photo as your original. if you want to save the original image your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the sheets per color channel of the revised image. 8-bit coding is the far widespread JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high quality images. this coding requires also more disk space, calculating time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialog for the processing of raw materials. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. a detailed tutorial for the use of color profiles can draw the chapter colour management to rate.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under color images. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner must always do the same bug and you can always find the same correction. in the manual for sound correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful opportunity to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digiplug; tool Farbeet provides you four color defects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canisting filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, solar power, also known as Sabatier, was a effect of the brightly developed printing of a short lightening. this was the effect that the brighter zones dared and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this tool was a partial negative image of the image. this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity the image shows what is chemically possible. an additional increase is finally revealing a negative image that is not to generate photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar power effect. the original image is the (1) and the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation guarantee that he makes a stronger contrast effect of the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a colored color film which is produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also some pictures of choice, especially those of barely landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slips of the size of the Neonlight. at large pictures, the filter can use the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to adjust the colour mutations and luminosity of the photos in the menu. once you are pleased to view the different color paper. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the inverted problem. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice for saturation instead of them. all changes can be seen in preview. if they like the result you can confirm the changes to ook.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and simple candlosity / contrast / Gamma is the tool for the improvement in the exposure of exposure. even if the dialog appears too complicated for this tool, you will need to clarify the application of the slider. concrete the three slides below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graphs there are three slides in which are clicked in order to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the control is to postpone the controller and to make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right-hand side the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated on the basis of the image, updated. on the left-hand side are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic y axis is represented. for pictures of a digital camera, the large areas of constant colour is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones, and the lowest for medium sounds, often called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour tweezers can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadow, middle and light tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">The output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two knobs that can be used here for the output values, such as the input values can be used, for example, to create an excellent picture as a background for something different in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values will be set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and loading: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and later reloaded. Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using this mode and the three colorings, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, funds and sun sound. adjust the colour box to set the text values for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option to display overexposed pixels, all colour channels, to display overexposed pixel and you can display the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on show the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, and the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the correct image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the preview is updated dynamic in dependence of your settings. on the right-hand side are the following options available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this selection box allows the channel to be modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols are to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera, the linear Mode generates a wide beam of constant colour. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps in this case.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a shortwist to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones are correspondingly correspondding and corresponding picture pixel darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marking. if you want to change this mark on the area you want to move the original value. create a point on this line and move it then, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and shop: with these buttons, you can exactly do this. each curve which you have produced can be saved in the file system and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp Kurvenformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you are using this method and the three colour pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, central and sun sound. enable the colour pipette that you want to use and click the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option to display overexposed pixels in order to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you will get the combined result. this is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on show the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo, which was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sunshine was placed on the colour pette and applied on the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digious membrane; imaging is a tool to improve the colour channels or change colour portals of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour shades of the images. you can process it from the menu colors channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint as you can correct the relative distribution and impact. the left section of the window shows you a preview of. the original can be viewed as a comparison of your own riders.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you positioning this in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to view you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right at the bottom: regulators for red, green and construction allow you to retain the picture of brightness as well. if you use Luminance, it is particularly convenient if you use the monochrome device to generate great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix Monochrome, reducing the reduction of a color to a visible robber that comes from a limbs which does not occur at the same place in the color channel and their robbery in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome converting in which you need to reduce the farbrauschen.</seg>
<seg id="447">The saving as and loading buttons are used in this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option to display overexposed pixels, all colour channels, to display overexposed pixel and you can display the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on show the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was rearranged. the Luminance option is activated. the original picture is under (1) and the illustrated picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography it is black / white one step step because color pictures can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good for all scenarios and fits very well to portraits of the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film projection with a orange lentil filter. this improves landscapes, maritime and air photos. like the 002 Cokin (TM) Orangefilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotary filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lunar light to day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) RotFilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yelfilter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium sounds while he adds a little cold in the saddling. this is very similar to the process of a print and redevelopment in a sepad. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Coupled with the & digiplug; tool texture can apply to decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, regardless if it's a colour image or not, you can look like an old artist, a pop-portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: pshift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensional stability of the texture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the picture below. the original picture is (1) and the modified below (2) and the parameter relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">A decorative frame can be added to the digiplug; tool frame can add a decorative frame to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">To keep the eye of an audience in the boundaries of a photos is no easy task. to keep the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the strizing eye. this is a psychological barrier for the striker's eye. under picture frame the module can be launched from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired frame type for your picture. penetrates the picture with a colored line, Nipce twisted it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white pictures), it is ideal for a button-scale effect and decoratively adds a decorative frame with pattern.</seg>
<seg id="464">The width of the frame is in percent. the value for the width is limited to 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The finish line is bigger than the original but the same aspect ratio has. this is important for the printing of the images, especially if you have used the tool after side-up.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tools, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture of any arbitrary place. this also runs on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with your mouse. use the larger image, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its features such as you need. at the end, you simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. already the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any adjustment that you have chosen for your text can be changed when you press the button "OK. after the picture has been saved, the text part of the picture can be changed. it can't be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the digiplug; tool Templates can apply a stencil to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Menu image template in the image processing can be used to lay templates about a painting.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there is no restrictions about the size and orientation. you need to add the PNG file format and you should add your template's file format. if you want to add your template's file format, you just send a email to the & digious database, just send an e-mail to the & digious database.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to put your template folder with the button basis in the dialog. choose the folder where you have copied the templates for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder set for templates, a building view, which reflects the file structure of the stencil printer. the selection of a folder is updated automatically, the toolbar of templates is automatically updated.</seg>
<seg id="474">You can find three buttons with which you can modify the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the lower picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this knob is resized the opposite image. if you want to use the mouse to use the template. if you want to use the template onto the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Shift: use this button to postpone this button in front of the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template on your picture. the image will then be adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digious materials; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpen is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but, particularly in dark areas, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Impetus mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture of visual acuity. indeed, it does not use psychological legitimate. you can use it to remove a really good job. the algorithm was made from Gimp here and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">The focus is probably the best of the three because he has really improved the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized pictures require a correction of the sharpness. this is why sharp edges can be printed along with a common paint. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras need more then tolerable sharpness as normal cameras for the private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera has been used to create internal sharpening. pictures in the shell format must always be harassed in the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner will apply a sharpness filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get your control over your picture.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpen a photo with the sharpenalties. you can correct with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should get carefully circumvent because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increase the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, you can adjust it about the menu entry. in general, you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution that correct a little soft, is significantly easier than sharpen drawing with the menu entry, and experimenting with the settings. the preview window on the right-hand side of the dialog displays you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is extremely easy masked is a very good tool to remove sanding from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often good results and should strengthen the effect. if you make the impulse mask to be strong, noise and the impression of grass in the proximity of sharp edges generate.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius looks like many pixels on each side of an edge through the filters. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen photos at best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiper image one of the original is added, thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the difference amount. it can therefore define a minimum difference to allow for an edge of filters with a soft change between the tones of sharpening and therefore beauties-errors are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp filter. the original picture is the (1) and the machined picture (2). minor masked was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious point; tool refocus on an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected by Ernst Lippe with the copyright protected by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to get an image too & quot; rectified. this is better approach than just trying to try the photo. it is using a technique called FIR Vienna filtration. it is usually achieved better results as sharp masked. you can start it from the menu by calling colors reproducible in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular circuit works much better than the Gauss's Funding. the GIR Vienna Inverse has a very long tail, which leads far from the original source, which is far influenced by the original source, which is even very strong in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. the undesirable results are caused by undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular section. it is the most important parameters for the use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is extremely blurred, but then you should consider to a button.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase of correlation was used by the correlation. the correlation was chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the applied effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Pirate filter: an increase of the space filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a high value is 0,03. a high value is even further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. in most cases, use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value equal to zero, you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the robber filters.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matter size: this value determines the size of the matrix matrix. an increase in the matrix size can be good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauge's sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range from 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refund parameter set you set to be saved for later and then can be loaded then.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that many surgeries alterations are not visible immediately, but later the unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you can read and compress images, & eg; when JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, extremely sharp maskan produces better results as sharpening. this could be caused by sharp masked a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must have no sharp masked more artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the impulse. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the best lens filters. the FIR Viennese filter is often better than the treatment of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is attributable to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methodology in digital photo, you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator must be darkened in the range of dark, in order to produce a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The tinplate allows the adapted color for the pupil. if you want to adjust blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool aspect ratio is one of the most developed tool in order to remove the required artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The induction algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider Glue and Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Details p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth glass than the picture. for larger values, mainly homogenous regions gland and details can be sharp. please note that no sharpening should be reasonably ranked.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is near to 1 only in one direction. if you want to create a high-wave pattern or CCD noise. JPEG Artefacts are best eliminated at a value near from 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor via allit. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, use this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: is there as often the algorithm run. usually 1 or 2 is out.</seg>
<seg id="524">Step forward as [5, 90]: angle dependenial integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small, there should also be small for a long term. therefore, make sure that small angle should be a long time. you should therefore choose this value as much and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel glassment and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: the More to quality that you will receive by selecting this option is only small. it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to allow him to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons Save as and shop exactly this. each setting of image errors can now be stored in a text file and later reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Error correction is comparatively very fast during work. but it can take very long and take a high CPU load after it. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button abbreviation.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture error corrects with little artifacts. the module is used in a picture that has been used in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you see, there is an intrinsient black artefacts in the foreground that is caused by a bad movie storage during the trip. the original picture is under (1) and this corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digious production, noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool presents selected image filter available to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensor cartridges from the camera or Moirev; -effects of detected pictures from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about digital cameras from digital cameras, you can read this tutorial on English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot picture above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grains that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the bottom window details and the bottom window advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. great values increase the time the filters are needed, and the picture specified by the radius specified in it is smoother and thus smaller mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpest level. this value reduces the pixel pitch of the filter to the front if it is increased. if the value is too high, the adaptive filters can no longer get more and robber or smelling.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy of the filter. this value increases the response time of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or smoke spikes can occur. set it up to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG-artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend either colour or luminary to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend either colour or luminary to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma rays of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dark areas, which typically are stronger, but also polluted the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phasenjittering damping. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of luminance. if it is too high, the edges may occur if he is at a minimum, it can remove noise and phasenjitter on the edges. he can remove smoked tips and is the recommended method.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and shop: these buttons are used precisely for it. all parameters for noise, which you have set, can be saved in the file system and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how space-saving your life can change. the original picture is marked with (1) and this corrected using (2) and the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crispy for your purpose. fortunately, use a little soft than a picture. use this tool to switch turnout with the menu entry and experimenting with the pane. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digious system; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photography file.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to dive suit, scratches, compression and local bugs which captures in digital, original or subsequent digitalized pictures, to remove the same thing as it makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and texturing. the texture rate is developed with another tool, the image error was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannay and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. it creates some compression & quot; artifacts & quot; - small standards that are in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons store as and store are precisely this. each setting of photo restration can be saved in a text file and later reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restration is comparatively very fast during work. but it can take very long and take a high CPU load after it. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored as a photo with equate noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious filmmaker on the faces. the original picture is under (1) and this corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures was applied to an old color photo taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts from scratch-lighting and the photo paper. the original picture is under (1) and this corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digious tool is hotpixel of photos that have a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed too. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are particularly useful with high quality raw mode, because many cameras with JPEG compression has a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; .quot; light pixel rates; on a picture with a dark image substrates. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel. they are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to discover the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD Defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching colour image to correct image. a automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the assistant will notice the last dark image and restart it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image range and the preview can help you correct within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are lifted in all situations areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Choose a defective map to preview the defective pixels on preview and the results of the filter. choose the best filter method to interpolate this pixel blocks. these are the available filters are:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it is determined an average of the neighbors pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defectives in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from a pixel pitch will be pulled to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtering method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to a pixel block are moved to compute a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which then is used to interpolate the pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi-cubical surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim) which then is used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a colour photo, from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposures, used to see the original picture was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digious document; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e., subject to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle objective, in particular the entire sensor area is not evenly lit. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) it the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lens show this behaviour in circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide-angle objective should also be able to use with Center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise unconventional effects through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's filming and colour and colour of digital cameras, it is possible to simulate the effect of a cue filter to simulate the effect of a cite filter. the tool vignetting correction is based on an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three traders you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further alignment of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light amplifiers at the point of the largest density filter. the default density is 2.0, or randomly to compensate a lens speed of 2, ent.Increase the density to compensate a larger degree of vignetting to compensate it by a little degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Candy intensity, contrast and gamma settings: the processing of a picture with the vignetting correction reduces the luminosity of the target with these options. the regulator do not require positive values, as you need to increase the settings only.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine repositioning of the reflections of the target image, then let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digious sheet; imaging from the menu colour gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction on a painting. the original picture (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the correct image. a correcting and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digious system; Linear distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. coloured distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree is the overall geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar lap effect, but has applied to the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of coefficient corrects the distant corners to the second ridge. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally, this value controls the strength of the distortion second grades. with negative values, tons-shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values of kiscated distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion. this value is stronger than in the edges as in the middle of the image. for most lentils, the "corners parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scale the image size and leads to the correction of first grades. negative values magnifying the picture during positive the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts magnitude in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners, while positive values are increased.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialogue with a preview the correction correction. the values you are using for your picture, are saved and used in the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons or cold-shaped correction should be performed before all the cutting and size changes. best if you want to re-cut this correction as all first. if you want to re-cut a picture and afterwards carry out a tannular correction, the effect is apparent to the False.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to display this tool is a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the sea level or building screen, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in connection, you can correct the tp / kissenic distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">When you make a cold-shaped distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can easily remove them with the cutting tool in the menu. remove them from the image processing or through the control knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tannular correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs such as recordings from the front, frame and paintings is the perspective for correct all angles in the image 90 degrees. be aware that when you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnage correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GennGuru.org website under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfra film, see the URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with your mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview can be used to simulate two parameters for film seeds and film sensitivity (ISO). the ISO controller changes the amount of film seeds and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows will white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter color ducts intended to produce an infrared film, particularly the green, makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos since colour documents are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-free image from New Zealand. the original picture is under (1) and the illustrated picture below (2). the sensitivity of the movie was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a sort of amura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digious form; filter film-grain is an easy-to-use tool for producing film seeds like e.g. the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known for the sensitivity of the films. mix the manufacturer of large silver trays of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film effect of film effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past. if you want to get a timeless atmosphere in your everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grained look especially in your monochroms photos so you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the body, even though higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter repeatedly.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film effect based on a black / white image. the original picture is the (1) and the worked film sensitivity complies with ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The oil paintings, oil painting, produced the appearance of a oil painting. it uses a protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digious design; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting. natural images and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knob to affect this effect. the upper elects the brush size between one and five. thick brush is better suited for large pictures. smooth or read from the other side, the hinge.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the material is marked with the (2). pin size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth. 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digious occurred; filter charcoal drawing uses paint and intentions to create a carboneskizze. the lines whose gradients are slow down, therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you have chosen what scene you might have chosen you to catch you.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digious visualisation; filter engraving the image in 3-D if it was stamped on wax. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digious tool, filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with pictures featuring a simple structure where colour is not the most important in content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the picture into a grey, montory landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contraction of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the revised picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a regular photo into an artwork using distortion effect using distortion effect by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the picture in the cells and it will look like if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1 is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time for calculating and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a regular photo into an art works using infinite effects. it uses protected protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom lens: wipes the picture along stone-shaped lines run out from a centre. this simulates the imaging an zooming camera and thus produces a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radical imsharpness: wiped the image by rotating the pixels by rotating the imitness of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Range sharpness: wiped the picture around the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to resign back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion-sharpness: wiped the image with horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the impulse of a linear moving, z: B: a car or by train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softness softness: wipes the image softened in the dark and strong in the light tones. this creates pictures with a dream and bright focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour-photos or add a warm and subtle light bulb.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shuttered sharpness: wiped the image by chance shift in pixel and simulates the impulse of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpness: finds the paddling pool in the picture and wiped it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the picture in rectangular cell and then created it by filling the colt with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time for calculating and cause high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops onto your picture. this makes it a natural look. it uses Pieter Voloshyn by copyright protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dripping size allows to change the size of the drops. since the tropic size is not generated automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish balls changes the optical effect of drop in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can start with the & digious process; imaging a range from raindrops. use the tool bar to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area should be freely moved from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regropolis filter. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the worked picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photograph shows the wrong orientation, so you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transformation Turning or transformations mirroring.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo single bubbles definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a picture at a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to smaller is simple. the big question is how you can find an image that can be seen or guess the boundaries of the resolution? how can you find the missing information again? how can I see the missing information here? how can you see the missing information here. try him and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size and enter the size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog box is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for the size is using a linear interpolation method to increase the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, then try the tool for bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many images of image programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep an aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original size is retained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons Save as and store are used exactly. each entry for photo can be saved as text file and later reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo vases is very fast with what it makes, but it can take very long and take a high CPU load after it. you can break the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo vases by adding a small color picture to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification as comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not just a common operation but also a common tool to summarize a photo. to make a photo you just need just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pick up the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while you move your mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut out. this allows you to pull a good overview like your photo. you can pull the size of the cutting surface by moving to the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by clicking with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the incision, use the button Start button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or file Save as in the menu to save the newly selected photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or transverse format. in the high format, always the larger value of height and in the lateral format is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool is based on an aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you use centimeters, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons have been designed to automatically centred the selection by horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Down in the dialog you can set with the Max. ratio in the area for cutting to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool is based on the aspect ratio, depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or vertical), when adding the trimming tool, these settings are stored as standard values, depending on orientation, so that the EXIF data are stored inside the image, and do not reflect the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of compositions support allow you to hide your images better. these are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third party, harmonic triangles are to be harmonised in the diagonal to harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a pitch that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the Blüttenleaves of a flower trees. it dives in all the possible things to find out as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the error number 1,618033988... and you already used to create your temple and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you have your paintings, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number directs from the Fibonacci series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the standing divider is 1: 1,618 the golden middle. a composition that is usually follows as a visual harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle makes liquefied medical devices available when you merge an image. you are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photo. compared to the third party, the golden spiral pierced a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this kind of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called the golden ring. it should give something that the eye sees the center of composition. that can be a line of or different objects. that can be just as his eye can lead to the eye, it will fulfill his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also differ from the above-mentioned golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles do not have equilateral triangles. diagonal to this lines can be found on a static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, you can create a effect of professional photography by dynamic symmetry. try your focal point at one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach any other.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal and vertical mirrals can be used to mirror the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the support lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. on this type you can customize the color of your actual picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontally. this creates a picture, where things can be rotated at an angle. you can manually repair any video editing and tool-free rotation. select the free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slipangle. the values on this slide can be set in degrees. with the button settings, you can set the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of turn is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module allows free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer to the picture to the two lines. after you fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now, adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture, you will find undesirable three square holes in the corners. an opportunity to repair is the function transforming them from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is automatic. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option stops the picture a bit after the turn. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectral transformations are performed by a fixation point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your picture. you will then find some information which you will find here. on the right-hand side of the dialog, you will find some information about changing the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new picture, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly contaminated. for a individual adjustment, this effect is small but two adjustments generate a double as strong effect and you should avoid that if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes to the corners. one way to bersome is the picture with transformations cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The mould tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite side. this is no rotation, the picture becomes distorted. with other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transformation loops.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissure your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press on default settings, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effectiveness will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview window.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help you get a vertical and a horizontal line. move your mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the control tool to adjust your picture.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the image, the picture becomes a bit wisely. for a single shot this effect is usually negligible, but two projections produce twice as much wiper and so you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After graduation, the image has triangular triangular holes in the corners. one possibility to eliminate this picture with transformations cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digious men; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. the available formats are therefore supported by your system and, in some cases, by the type like this libraries, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digious.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence of the other libraries, it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF?</seg>
<seg id="685">Digious files, displays only files in formats to the knows. this is done by the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is shown in the list, you may change the list of file extensions supported by the digious list. in the section configuration you will find further information here.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select even the format files. a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia, and supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression procedures to digital images. in this way, redundant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smooth results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also be saved, if it is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the shell format, you can read under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. in section configuration you can find further information on the use of modules with & digiplug;.</seg>

<seg id="729">Menu to open the Graphs in & Kate; open the graphs in & kgraph viewers; open in a & Kate; Component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Load from large graphs (at present there are problems from around 1000 nodes and a hack to present more than these knot)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional needed software: & kgraph viewer; is a & kite; program, which puts the & graph; -tool & dot; for representation of graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the opened Graphene, each in its own window. initially, if you start & kgraphs; without an argument, the main window will open only the symbol file and the (empty) list reopened files. click on the first icon to view the file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; -files selected, the main window looks like in the lower screen photo:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, a summary in the corner is displayed if Graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and runder without special keys, left and right at pressed & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. down below you see the maximum reduction of a graphic.</seg>
<seg id="737">When the straight in & kgraph viewer: invaded file changed from another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the Graph shall be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. if you want to ignore the change, you can also change your decision later, you can also set your choice later, you can also use the menu item Setkgraphs; set up, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graphic file outside a running & kgraph; -instance; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraph; -instance or to do the graphics in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option you can save your choice permanently, but also change with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When program launch, you can open all the graphs of your last meeting again. again, you can save your choice as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also set how the graph to be divided into several sides. the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be freely selected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graphite on one side will be ignored on this page. if you specify the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graphics.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The page Erneut shop is the possibility to define the behaviour if a file has been changed on hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can ignore a standard behavior (automatically reload or change the changes every time).</seg>
<seg id="746">The site opens the possibility to define the behavior of & kgraphs; define if a graph outside of a current session is opened. you can open a standard behavior for this case (graphs in a new window or in a window of running the current session) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The side seat management provides the possibility to define the start-behavior of & kgraph viewer; define a standard behavior (the files of the last session or not) or determine if required at each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which normally appears in a click on the main window with the & RMBn; opens up more possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose from various & graph algorithms; select the entries as described in the website of & graph viz;:</seg>
<seg id="750">Dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or stratified representations of allied graphs. the algorithm layeth the same direction (from top to bottom or left to right) and then tries to produce short edges and as few edge overlaps.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; -algorithm is the standard for unshined graphs. he produces representations according to the sprinter-spring model. the camel-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a jumping mat model layout. it uses the husbandman-clean gold sleeve, and includes a multifunction timer for the treatment of large and geological graphics.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & circo; algorithm calculates the nodes of circular mentioned in accordance with the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and meadow, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of several cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog box in which you can specify a layout command as a parameter, and the calculated layout of the graphics to stdout within the xdot format. with such layout command you can specify & eg; showing the graph, or graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graphs (stand or unged), the default algorithm for the type of type (dot; for directional, & neato; for undivided graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview is displayed if this is necessary, otherwise it will not display and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Shows what is the mouse pointer. click with this mouse pointer to a & GUI; -element to obtain further assistance on this element (if present).</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical location allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates within the metadata of a picture and to edit the geographical data can be stored in the EXIF label and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical location provides tools to geographical images geographically in the spherical coordination system which is used by GPS and Galileo is used to localize images, longitudinal and latitudinal are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS storage as XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsone can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS trace.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call up the menu. in order to run up a possible correlation of time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains of course data that were included in the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, automatic correlation was carried out in red. GPS data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum deviation for the maximum time deviation is a maximum deviation for the GPS time and camera time. the deviation of this is the maximum value of this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have any trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options of the interpolo and difference in min. can be used if you do not have matching data. if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS is, you can set this limits here and make the knock correlated to the interpolo.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog will need to use the coordinates from a call to the next page you need to use the OK button to set the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">Location can also be found and placed on the displayed map and enlarge it. in addition, select the appropriate region and enlarge it. the height can always be selected manually, until you have to be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite photo and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang on the pictures. here's a small script that the exiftool is used to feature a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that can be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages. the character set is encoded with UTF-8 encoding.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. you need to select all albums that can be exported to HTML. you can quickly select a large number of albums on the right-hand side. in the field it will quickly appear to select a large number of albums. in the area below, the show is displayed and the text of the HTML page will appear in the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side. this rider can also be created a gallery in each picture. if you click on a picture, a new page is opened in the picture. otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider record defines the settings where and how the gallery must be saved with all your appropriate images. choose a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder containing the name KIPIHTMLexporting that contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other colours, you can change the standard colour depth. the size of course also influences the file size. all other settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="828">The Reiter preview pictures allows you some of the settings of the album, for preview pictures, that are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user as far as the action is. press off to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module produces the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the programs that occurred while the creation occurred. the web browser will start automatically at the end to view the preview window. press Close to connect the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows Ihnene a selection of images and perform on them basic operations such as scripting, zooming, or shifting. the viewer can be used with short notice and masts. it has been developed for fast image displaying and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After starting a picture, a picture can be displayed in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change pictures without sacrificing your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save images in JPEG format, without saving losses of quality, or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size is rising, as no compressing of the color information takes place. this can be found e.g. with PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera-client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera-client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.a. please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The Metadata module is currently no documentation. if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module you can copy from a picture to another. then select the import function to copy the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the file selection dialog to which you have pressed the metadata. the data will be copied after you hit the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please check Exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a set of images into a MPEG video in form of a dip.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Kodierer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length to convert. this module allows you to add a basic aspect ratio between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the diashau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically on the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can use a background color for the selected video format. with this module, it is possible to use the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD players. finally, using the Mediums you can only use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the pictures to be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. after that, you can start the module via extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images that are selected by you are listed in the portfolio by image files. there you can also change sorting images or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning the file on a TV, you need to set the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture. the speed of the image transfer is defined below. a low value generates very sudden, a high contrast is very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and the path of the created file you can specify the name of the MPEG-output file. if possible, keep the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file using the name of the audio source file, then you will need to start downloading the movie with the button. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now drink quickly or in any quiet a coffee, when you're back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a reference appears that Kodiers or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer assistant allows you to print several pictures on a sheet paper to print in standard photo sizes. this is also automatically open to the image processing Gimp. this is partially useful to upgrade to you or to print it with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import and convert your files stored in the RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original feature by him is: expect from dcraw not to get the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you can get dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, choose the RAW file to be converted and run the module. the Raw image Converter will then appear in mode for a single picture. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values newly adjusted to optimise the converting process. the first option decides whether the camera settings can be adjusted for white, brightness and red / blue amplifiers. if the result is not optimal, you can process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in the RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are pleased with preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the converting results. the filename remains identical and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, reserves all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you have pre-edit your images, or later you should not use the JPEG format, as it's only a limited number of operations before the image quality are deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to retain the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG formats, the metadata can be stored in the RAW file in the EXIF file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings with the upgrade button to start the conversion. if you want to break this process, you can stop using it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking processing mode allows you to convert different images to once. use this mode if you are safe, for example through testing a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you've found here the possibility of existent file automatically. this is helpful if they have been produced in an earlier attempt. however, a preview can be seen as far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images into an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of a album. you can set the prefix to set the start number and timestamp.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a collection of image files. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can minimize the image or enlarge. in addition, four types of image changes are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image will be selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option to adapt to your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: non-proportional representation in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: preparing the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, boundary size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the decisive pictures before. additional pictures can draw on the list of changing images and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have launched the module, the images window will be displayed with you from the chosen pictures. you can add additional pictures through the button dialog for the last selected image. a preview of the selected image will be displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and place them here to add the list of the missing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="875">The buttons images will be removed from the list of selected images from the list.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message with the OK button. you'll need to add the addresses and subject to the subject. you'll need to add the addresses and subject to the subject. the pictures are attached to you as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Please make sure to send a lot of pictures at once. most email accounts have restrictions for the size of sending e-mails. there may be a good idea to send several messages when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window will be used to change the images for sending the images. your configuration will be stored and always uses up to change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird so you must specify the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you need to install the GMailagent on your computer. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the election of comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the images into a text file and added the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to the lossless formats like TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you are using JPEG pictures, select the original files in JPEG format, then the original Exifdata will be added to the crucial pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is ready, the window will not automatically be closed, that you can view the status messages, on the search for errors, but your e-mail program will start automatically at the end. with the button closure, you can build this window slie? EN.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions like you want to have shown your Diashau. you can choose between you selected and choose the images of the album here.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transferring option in the presentation allows very elegant images to be used by OpenGL. however, you must have a graphics card here, otherwise the slides will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option provides that the filename of the pictures are displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The Vloop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop. you can manually start with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select that the images is displayed in random order, so it is not used the order of pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between the images can be set the temporal distance between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. you should be austere before your friends show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly select a different effect on each transition between the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diaschau you can access a toolbar at the upper left hand side. move your mouse in this corner around you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again, stop the previous and the next image and stop the dip.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left of the lower screen, you can see the current file name, the position of the current picture and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date are currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.a. please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set up an image as a background picture of the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of sub-frame, as background for your KDE working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & knotation album; see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the picture, now in each group, so in people, places and in group keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories as you have entered your pictures and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to view the file structure on your hard drive and look at the current preview pictures. in the following will be described every one for itself.</seg>
<seg id="900">When using the mouse button on the entry, it changes the browser toolbar. see image.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the pictures are displayed, on which both persons can be seen. by this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed images to a few thousand pictures on a couple of few pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">When you have selected all the people, places and other settings you can view with preview pictures to view the images of your efficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol above their names. you can save with & knotation album; however, for each person a separate vision, this also applies to places, words and other categories which you have defined yourself. see also the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button you need to set the right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can set the view for each category separately. that has the advantage that you can only show symbols with images of persons and simultaneously a list of keywords (if you have no suitable pictures for your search words).</seg>
<seg id="905">You need to define which image for each individual person is to be displayed. in order to see this, you must select the image editor, as illustrated in the picture. in the safer window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and therefore select which part of the picture is to be shown and cut.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you search for the entry in the main window, you will give you a dialogue, which is very similar to the dialog for determining the image properties very similar. this dialog can view this dialog once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a character sequence in the field of lettering or description, you can also enter a date after searching for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e., for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures by certain names, as you can see in the picture. here the pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & knoting album; if you don't like to read handbooks, but rather try to try functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage from & knotebook; and look at the fast-pass, the screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & knoting album; and select the first dialog for demo, if you start & knoting album; for the first time, or select the menu entry in the menu entry; then you will load some example images and you can try the functions of & knotebook.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this handbook, you will find it on the homepage of & knotebook; as a associated HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the main window of & knotch's album; see the Timeline. a picture of this strip has been seen here:. as the name suggests, this laces will show you data statistics on your database in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time strip may show you several different time units. each glue then shows a different unit. you can switch between the units of years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by performing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time bar may be available on the following ways: you can select the displayed entries preview from the database (if you select a Date, the first picture will show you the current date displayed in preview window) and in addition, the time bar will always show the current date of displayed images if you want to navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time line, by clicking the mouse button pressed and the mouse over the ruler of the time strip, so the time values will be displayed. you can choose from the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& full studio album; provides you two possibilities to create HTML pages with your pictures. the one is integrated in & knotebook; integrated version described in & knotebook; integrated version that you can create over the menu file HTML... call.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages have to be created, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three sectors contents, layout and target. in the following will be more detailed.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the transferring and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on cd's album; HTML example pages do you see an example of this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & knotebook album; export file is created, that can be seen on the overview side. ferry information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. for example, you can avoid that information is displayed by a party. for example, that all pictures of one party are obvious. please note that all images are exported from a party. currently, you can not use this setting in order to conceal certain pictures from particular mind.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most adjustment possibilities are clearly, why this is not especially been made.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the images. thus, those have to view your website and possess a monitor, which supports maximum resolution 800x600; for example, to download a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewing allows you to change the resolution at any time. it can thus be your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transfer rate, and if he wants to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range, put the different folders and the URL to where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way, select a basic file for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the main folder where all your pictures are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically adds to all future images. here you can select either a folder or one of KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check this really all for viewer. if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created, start this folder should be. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">In case that the HTML files created by you do not need to copy them in the final target folder, see, correctly, you must specify the final destination of files. this is not the subfolder of current files, but the basic folder in which all sub-folders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The only possible adjustment options have moved all three to basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you set in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking forward to a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & knotebook; you may want to add a HTML page to view the images. if you're already looking for a much time for this, you need to go with & knoting album; this work is not yet to do this.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & knoting album; you can export a copy of your images into a .kin file. you can import other files into your database. the image teams are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kin files, internal and external. they differ as if the pictures are stored in the file or if you have all the images into the file, that you may have all pictures put together and place this file as independent. however, the clear downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the menu file extension... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file searches the pictures that are displayed in the file of .kim file. if the images are not found in the file of .kim file, the images are the URL that you have searched for the creation of HTML files. this is naturally only possible if you have created your .kin file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following step, the dialog for Export Photos is described, which you can retrieve over the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three selection options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">On the Manually close to the .kin file, you have to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically in the .kim file, copy & kcd album; the pictures will automatically copy for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG compressed and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not recommended to compress the files. if you want to compress it, simply select the export file to compress the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is limit Maximum image size limit. if you would like to send your friends pictures, you may want to limit the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would be very large. here you can say that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file using the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importing... select & kcd album; the exported database as described in described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to the importing consists of four steps. first you need to select what pictures you want to import, then in what folder you want to import the images.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are called the category persons of imported file personnel (if you are a Dane) while this category is called for your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialogue window, which are to be imported into the category of imported file and which categories are to match these categories in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can retrieve the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. for example, click on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse pictures and watch images: if you look at pictures, you would often want to see images in different picture-groups & mdash; if you want to see images of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your boyfriend you might want to see all of the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this handbook, you will find the various steps (1) fixed the information on your images via (2) to walk through (3) advanced themes and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">The photo album has been released as a program for managing your pictures. but it was expanded and today, it also cares about images. in many places in this manual, there are more images, but frequently, this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& full studio album; records all of its information in the file index.xml in the top of their images. this is a simple XML file, which you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in the CVS.</seg>
<seg id="950">& knoting album; remembers the folder where your pictures are stored and used this with future Starts automatically. if you would like to start a different database in & knotebook; if you want to start a different file tree with pictures, you can start & knoting album; using the -c option -c ~ / company / index / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings knotalbum; set up... go to a window that you can change the settings of & knoting album; in the following section of the user book you will be explained to the various adjustment options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons, with which you can use the options for viewing and viewing the options for viewing, which you can call through a button transfer to the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described to you as you can define various properties, such as people, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On the dialog box is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can choose a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories, subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog, you can set full member groups, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group of groups instead of all groups of a mediator as stated in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the setting options, you can select the category list. with the above mentioned selection list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window, a list with the current category and in the right is a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& full studio album; splits the modular system with other graphic applications such as digiKam and Gwens. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plug-in interface. click on the site of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called over the menu modules. they can not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & knotebook as they are sold separately. however, most modules have a help page that you can call over the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together among several applications, it may be that the modules are tested with & knoting album; therefore, you should always test new modules with the command &gt; button Album -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu. don't say, I would not have warned.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI, are very different, so it can be that some modules with & knoting album; do not work. this is the downside when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & knotebook; and other applications that are also using KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported in albums: this kind of order not supported, it simulates the order for some modules the order to albums, so that you can use the features with & knoting album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & knotice's album; the current album that just corresponds to the current view, so all the images that shows you the picture gallery.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album it has to be released & knoting album; the modules also has a list of albums. here's & knoting album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & knoting album; s browser can display the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry is a record for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or this is the category that you have specified in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums. for example, if you are using the category persons, it will be possible to do so if you would have chosen persons to view and the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are with & knoting album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select the modules that are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you will see an example for a starting screen as soon as you start & knoting album; starting with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see a menu and a toolbar. under the toolbar you can view the window that you will not have any information about your images. in the section we will not view this window, but now click on the entry images that shows you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & knotebook; is the option to watch each picture with notes. these include information about the people appearing on the picture, where the picture can be shown individually or for a larger number of pictures, set simultaneously on all pictures of Jesper, and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for Search and Browsen, as you can read in the section. if you want to see this remarks if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In the list, see three lists with a text field by using persons, places and words. these are a very important part of & knotebook album; as you can always use it again when you enter more information on your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to reject the pictures within the list: if you have a family party, and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people can be shown, so that the used names are shifted upwards to find the persons faster and can be assigned.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an illiterated list, click on the icon to sort by date in the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have chosen comments on any picture, you may wish to edit all the selected images and have these pictures with notes. click in this case simply to the front and back buttons, which are under the preview of the image right above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all these images and menu item multiple entries at one time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window to display the USA as an overgroup. to show you indicate that it is a special group, will be shown a special symbol.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Recognition is it possible to add an entry to a existing or new or subcategory. additionally, you can also take an entry to this entry and place there, in order to make this entry into a subcategory. attention, this assumes that you are straight using your categories in alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the relevant catalogue by postpone the lath, which form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window by moving it out outside the window range.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs, click on the button options, click on the button options... that provides you among others the opportunity to save the current structure and the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also finish a complete frame. if you want to get a complete end of this window, use the button options... and then window will be a / off window. this process will see you in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in browser, you will get an overview with views of the currently selected pictures, or all the images if you have no filter. for example, you can see the size of preview pictures, in simple to bottom drawing of mouse with the middle mouse button. try it simple.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you plan an image on your desktop background, this picture will be set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this picture will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you have not opened any window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image preview. choose the corresponding pictures you want to delete and choose either the remove button or choose from the menu menu. now, the window will be shown you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& Full Version; provides you for this problem a solution. you can also use & knoting album; namely images also, you need to record the pictures somewhere else, so that you can record the pictures somewhere in the database-index. in the picture you can see the view of & kp album; if not all necessary pictures of the disk can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images of which the right corner is truncated if the right corner is not stored on the hard disk. for example, in the pictures 1-9, however, the preview pictures are present, so you can preview the preview of this pictures. you can also view this pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this function you need files from the folders and to copy it again. if you want to install files from files to the concerned CD. if you want to avoid paging your images, please buy a larger hard drive to save all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to stay a little more privacy, you can view the images that you may see for other inaccessible menu. alternatively, you can also see all images that can see your little sister, control and select the menu entry all out of current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have set what pictures in the case of the Feverything should be hidden. if you want to lock the menu entry into your little sister, simply choose the menu entry, which you want to be locked. if you want to view the photos again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to define a password which must be entered into the unlocking of the images. to set this password, simply select password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is not very safe. for example, any one of them can read or delete your password as uncoded text, or delete this kind of password protection. this type of password protection is only intended to be those who are familiar with & knotches; not very familiar with sight on private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want all your images with & knoting album; manage and spend hours over hours so that you want to look at some time. this is why you can view it sometime, using a picture _ and video viewer. you can preview it from the preview of how in described, start.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see in view. it shows the image, but additional all information you can enter over the picture, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where was it made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can also configure this simple with your mouse and you can also configure what information can be displayed at all. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. then appearing context menu, you can see below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click on this page, see, matching entries to this display. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the images of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have several pictures of the viewer, you can change between them and return, by using the keys image high and image. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as a dip album; then invites you to press a new picture after a few seconds. how often a new picture will be checked by clicking the Ctrl button and plus or minus and stopped by the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability to change from & knotebook; is it in full screen mode. in this mode the viewer is using the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch in full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you are using the viewer, you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus key, you can easily zoom out the Plus button in the middle of the image. showing how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the picture is not drawn. with the same button, the zooming, so that every pixel is equal to the screen of a picture of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that can work with videos that are in and out-zooming with the Plus- and Minustar.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the scripts from the context menu, you can turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can do notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at the picture you can see a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. at the moment you can open the view and configuration dialog for the image to enter these names. however, if you may preview only the image to mark and see further images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper. to see what photos you want to start viewing with pictures and select it as good or bad, while you see one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above you will feature the opportunity to view images with features, while you are viewing this. features are the letters A-Z and you can set a feature that you can press the corresponding letters. see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, you can view this in your browser. if you have selected all the images you can edit, print or whatever you have chosen, you can also use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview window. if you press categories in DRE Vorbis View, then you can add features to the pictures by clicking the letters for the feature, after the picture was chosen. this can see here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case you are allowed to paint & knotebook; on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painted old will not be saved with the picture but in the database. you can reverse your pre-old later on.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to see a painting on the screen has been painted on the screen. on the painting mode from & knotebook; then select on the picture paint from the context menu. to finish the malen. simply select the cross in the toolbar at the window at the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler, you must have the use of the program & Povray; you do not need to rule completely, but documentation to & Povray; you should have read and understood.</seg>

<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 has already included the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you process a texture or a part of a texture, you can see a preview in the self-economic view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press on Preview in the self-economic view and a small example of the scene will be selected with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is selected, even if you want to set a lower element. for example, if you want to set a texture in a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross the local texture.</seg>

<seg id="1036">To render the present scene, click on the icon Renders The Symbol Renders in the toolbar or select the menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode is equivalent to the entries in & Povray; s INI-files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can add many end modes, from a fast preview to full images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the toolbar or menu View, select the following dialog box:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but meaningful is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card map size you can enter the width and height of the left picture. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box under section and enter the image cutting into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality, you can select the characteristics that are using & Povray; for rendering. this is from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflecton lighting. an exhaustive description of the reader features can be found in the usandbuch (& Povray;).</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is controlled with only one ray per pixel, several errors can occur. these pictures often have a Moirè pattern or stuffing effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. in general photos can see pictures with this feature better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn off anti-aliasing, connect & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique means a super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is repeatedly referenced and adaptive because each pixel is getting back again and adaptive to the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray has chosen one ray per pixel. if the difference between color values will be adjusted to the specified pixels, both pixels will be calculated by a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the depth value on 4, a grating of 4x4 additional points will be charged with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) extra beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The cursive method starts with 4 rays each. if the difference is equal to the specified threshold levels, the pixels will be divided into 4 sub-pixel, and the maximum depth of the records can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to be reduced effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn jittering, changes & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the renderings is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse reflection rate will be calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this cardboard card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object.</seg>

<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and a better sewing unit for the displayed objects, but require more time to Rendering. for some objects like the ball you can set the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross travel projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection screen. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this property yields better rapprochement for the projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross wall, a wall behind the objects is illustrated. the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a floor is folded down below the objects. the floor is displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you have checkable antialiasing method, the non-recursive antialiasing method for rendering of scenes is used. the values for the depth and swelling value can be set. more specific indications concerning the parameters can be found in the section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window, it is explained how to create and store Window.</seg>

<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to start with accurate knowledge of both programs. if you're going to create simple scene in all steps, you should very popular among beginners, very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should keep the following warnings carefully before you complain about a black screen. if you are using a 3D program for first time, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't have any camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you add no light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have any error installed, you can see during the first start of & kpovmodeler, the following pre-set window mapping:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and using existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation that you can expect from that program you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">They are often using these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application must be noted.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and select the menu entry to Edit menu. thus, you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wireless model view shows how the camera saw the whole scene that you generate. in particular, you can remember that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this is the result of the scene's reputation.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now includes a new entry containing the label camera. if they click on it, see the content of the view features, in which the different parameters of the camera will be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing at the basic settings of the camera, this is later sublines, but note that the camera can change to the camera with which you can change the target point of camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button application or the input, change the wire model views and the object tree immediately accordingly to these settings. as a result, they see here the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could set for example a peader (insert body tader) and size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an incomprehensible method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually, an easy way to use. you can use an infinite level as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button. in the object tree the new name will be shown immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The open-section view is also showing the level, even if at the moment, only as limited level. if you renders the scene, the plane extends from the horizon to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you see the object branch exactly, you will notice that you can see the entry for the ground. in this case you will see the different parameters of the object. in this case you will see only the default options for each new object: scaling, turn and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise one unit among the horizontal line, so you can get some of these parameters. choose shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just choose the floor to hire its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a little bit more.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog for which you can select how the object is to be added. please choose the object. the pigment will change in the property tree. you can see the name in the self-economic view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the just a matte black material, because you need to preview the look of materials at any time with a click on Preview. now, enter the colours for the pigment. also there are many ways, but now take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on Quader and ball, click on the button users and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course you are not necessary to enter the color. here are other settings needed. in the color-list, you need to enter two new attributes. then you can also do this record twice (you can also do it more often, but the Schachbrett-Farbenlist can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the object-tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object features:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should already be done simply, as you should have understood the basic work of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object features you can immediately modify the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the input button or the button to press), so the sphere has suspended above the ground as you have moved the ground down to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the Renders now gives a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface looks like a matte black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now arrange a material now. as already on the ground, give the ball a pigment in color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">First, choose the object and change the name to the example of a sphere of pigments. click the ball of pigments, then choose Settings and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve an interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The Settings-effect and reflection result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of them that offers you & kpovmodeler; it's hopefully you have learned as much as you can create nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a corrective method to produce a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene raytracer from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes) through each pixel by the objects, the visual effects of the sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects can be seen as the example Nebula. thus, the scene will work for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without a camera you will see without a camera. without a light source you can also see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously each scene, that should be rendered, some lightssources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">The usual file dialog can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have created before using & kpovmodeler;</seg>

<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set the toolbars. you can add and remove commands to this option symbols for & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a possibility to prepare surfaces without rough surfaces without any hives on the surface without changing the geometric form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a Bump-Map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric forms which you can use as a building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further machined to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel base by using an image file as color chart.</seg>

<seg id="1492">It is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3b) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / focus / home / trueg / filfile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; can be read for & kde; with it all easy audio CD; s can be read and saved in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (compressed file data in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many Kodiers who are encoded using this WAV files (this coaster packets are not yet installed from the Linux distribution). more coders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of & CD; read and read in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (normally one per titles) compresses to the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggprebis (for MP3), oggprebis (for OGG) or other coders are already present, so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself. but if FLAC is not used, its installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What encoding / file format should be used? the Chapter Kodiver gives a small introduction by coders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudiocreator; this program is not intended to read any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD instrument can handle the protection. in every case it can handle & kaudiocreator; even avoid the mechanisms of copying protection. avoid simply the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once must be done (the setup dialog can often be called up to a suitable configuration), then the daily handling for reading a & CD; this is (hopefully) to understanding for the slim approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which coders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can pick & CD information from the freedb of the internet or work completely without network, with all that is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands from the main window. on the page step by step example you will find further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the register maps for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB will be on request to the CD data according to the setup of CDDB. (this may be locally or online, in the latter case must first be made the connection to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">To start reading and - when an encoder was configured in the registry settings, the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so the choice with another encoder is read as default. it is too aware that before the encoder was configured in the setup dialog for setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that a file uploaded file will be selected instead of a complete & CD; read and encode it.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the dialog for configuring the messages (such as protocols, pieport) for programming events (as read the & CD; closed).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main building dialog of & kaudiocreator; with various cards (such as Encoder, for setting up the encoders). here you must go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coders and compression ratios and helps you to choose the right body.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is supposed to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are other such as' hormone 'or' Monkey ', which may possibly be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats which lose data through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG mag today have a light advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above that bitrate the differences are much less important because both Kodiers are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, but only with most distributions are supplied free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (for high bitrates) but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with deeper bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG formators are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters to audio quality and resulting from results for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--precset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--precset Standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people with acceptable transparency and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi system with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--precset extreme '= 224-256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi system with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--precset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of one title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi system with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a titels. good enjoyment for music by youngsters, portable devices and car cereals, but not good enough for hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--precset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most of the environments we want to have the absolutely highest quality, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are entered manually or by the program will automatically be brought from the freedb via the internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & kaudiocreator; and the Kodiver program for the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodiver programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the body and these parameters here. the manual or help to the Kodiers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s must be encoded with lame, the switch-dd must be added of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like that: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters to be used (= button designation in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database in which people can read / enter the information up / write that all other these information can be downloaded instead of herself in the calculator. it's too aware that here only from text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (indication of the translation) I am not Attorney. however, no one prevent the information without the & CD; more or less valuable, so can neither the artist nor the music business damage can be added. all information can be obtained from a Bummel by a & CD; shop, physically or virtually.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active a check box (sending an address). in this kind of configuration, it seems, the e-mail address is not used when calling the data from server (This may only know the programmer who has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator is used, the geographically on the next door is used, this saves bandwidth on the network and equates the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freed.org provides a recent list of mirror servern for the online retrieval of & CD; information during outgoing a & CD; alternatively the entire database can be downloaded or (generally issued monthly) just the updates of database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What is the read program is used to store pieces from CD & CD; WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumored that cdparanoia is used to look at the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see Note that the cdparanoia package from the matching distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the file format WAV files can be selected and thus the required file format can be selected. during the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added on the Registration tab. other coders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The coaxial package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the code can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined turndiers. more information about Kodierer are in the chapters of the Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodiver can be received further information on its switch as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodiver.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check out the device name of the & CD; / DVD learns, write and read what both cdparanoia as well as the audio coders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give a hint that is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the sheath of & CD; this will not be joint!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with step by step example. even if you use other settings, these tips can give you how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Did you read the complete manual, everything understood, but they are still unsafe what to do. now, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that you want to do what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, everything setup and our first & CD; we'll be able to use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution as an appropriate package for lame can be found, as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile source files whatever you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd is that you own write permission (eg; to copy anything using the querqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something which is thought only once done and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the preview for reading a & CD; what to be repeated for each extras & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the use of encoding for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--precset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps). because we are lazy to use the program that use freedb to use the & CD; download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Even though we can change these settings at any time, we are very likely to change it with any & CD if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the read program that it can read / CD data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your running process. if it is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can also be accessed, so you can get a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the available entries of the device names for CD-ROM, and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card ticket General settings. here you can't do much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be shown as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, so that you may be informed when informations to the witnesses of sample words (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD, settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and let's download the & CD. data automatically download the internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the reading & CD-ROM, so that it can access the free server on the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, will start immediately the reading & CD. this is with low risk if you are later wrong with the database entry and the date / file names cannot be changed using conquor - &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to enter all manually, check the database fields and freedb is not used in offline mode. however, this is over 620 MB big, the two choices must be selected in offline mode, at least the two choices must be selected, at least the first card card is set up.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for the data subject to retrieve & CD; information from the freedb server on the Internet. how does the system get what data can get the CD? read the section about freedb. put everything as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we didn't download the database, we want to work on the Internet server using the remote database.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB Server: please go to page free of freed.org and look after a mirror server in your proximity. on this path, the load is distributed among the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both will work equivalent to the server, but there are many Firewalls the protocol 8880 standardly, there is maybe more happiness with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we want no & CD; collect data on the freedb server. the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply apply the settings from screen photograph. (make sure the folder / tmp is found on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous tracks: excuse, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? paralleled reading and encode? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; to check out the last piece: cross this to the & CD at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom file for temporary files: if you check out this file, then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored. this can't be useful if only place on another drive. don't forget to make this folder when you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All in this way, as it is on screen photo. the command is slightly long, under circumstances it must be scanned anything to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--precset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good stereo sound quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting rate bit rate is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of creating tags on version V1 / V1.1 'ID3v2 tags can also be deleted as required. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tagger for & kde; in case of later modification of the input (including the full path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside these sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: at a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we just completed the basic facility of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD. if you have chosen the organization's structure to smart, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described, as the process of reading the & CD. we will create MP3 files. the file structure is described as described in the previous section, as we are comfortable and the & CD; the process of which is described in this section has to be repeated for each extras & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is still not included in freedb, see the screen photos a bit different from considered for a & CD; with successfully obtained from freedb, you'll also learn the CD; data manually insert it instead of the Internet. comments are available on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet to happen, then the & CD must now be defined in the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and its length should be listed in window, just as in screen photo. this only if the CD-CD could be identified as an audio CD; it could be identified and cdparanoia can be identified.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening, you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Note: if the & CD can be collected from the freedb, all tracks are completed, then the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case that there is more than a entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key to your & CD; there will be a window built, and you can select the database entry, which fits best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for the automatic query from freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also send it manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you have no local database, you will need to connect the data to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'actuator title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not have to be entered into the login field "Update title ', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidiaell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments using the CD together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to verify the contents of the CD-editor, so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with case letters start or not...), but also to verify whether there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags that are limited to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the comment area. if you have ID3v2 tags, you have set up unlimited field length, at least on the field card Kodieraser settings; take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coders or file formats. see the help for Kodierer in order to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obvious in the style of the trigger-based CD; this example is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; -data soed.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap to be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', you come back to the main window. click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-editor will be back and you'll see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data which we have for the first piece. simply specify the entries for the fields of the current denomination. give the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and click the same way until you have entered all the title page of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is sorted into one of these categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles are selected, or out. a simple click on the line switches to select all the pieces, or select all the pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button selection selected by clicking on the button selection, this window appears for confirmation. click OK then and then we'll see a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider assignment to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you can, if you're trying to work with a Kodierer, which you have not yet installed. items which have not been successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example. did you checked if you have a writing to the folder for temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it's clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece of it, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 to the format MP3. thus, read and encode parallel. please note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setup to suppress and encode this behavior, the number of parallel operation is the result unclear. the calculator used with a AMD64 does not seem to have any problem when simultaneous and encode (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order in the waiting time of the body is coded. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will be decoded with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator; you need & kde; 3.revised resp. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can adjust the files in the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1638">Into the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be stored. consider that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button. it appears again the file dialog where you can select the song's song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setup of automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection is activated, a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening (using file or drag & drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and yellow. this collection will then be added to the opening pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the song and then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can choose the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the sub-menu sequence sequence of the menu collections, songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it from the collection manager or use the selection list on the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip another song, select the Next song, the entry next song from the menu, or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button prior to the previous piece, select the previous piece from the menu or press the button on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection, and click on the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary data may not be deleted. however, it doesn't matter because they are not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map which converts all events of type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. Awe - and Gus cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately there is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file of your hand (using your favorite password).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary modifications to play a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP -section that can appear so often as desired. but for that each appearance has a different text (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define KEYMAP, "name of the keymap"... END define CHANNELMAP... END... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that it is necessary to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as an e-mail, so I can do in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section is specified as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign is ignored. it is believed that the GM should be in the right order (from 0 to 127), so you cannot change the order and do not deal any line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is needed to place all sounds that need this instrument to place the tone with the number M. if your keyboard supports no tissue (e.g. with clay 60), which allows you to gain a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a tissue shot. for this purpose, apply the following in the PATCHMAP -section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">For example, if an MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (ripping), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch included in the patch, each tone is a different percussionist instrument (drum, basin, Maracas & etc;) and not that, in which the sound is the pitch of the same drum means that it means some keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument. use:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As in the PATCHMAP -section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several cones for each channel and instrument each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymkaps are used mostly to form tones to the percussion channel. take a look at the supplied Keymkaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, make it very easy in CHANNELMAP -section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built after the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, you need to use the keymap with the name name for this channel. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will ignore the patch on this channel. in this case, it will always be used for patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the percussions patch on the perimeter channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio indicates in which the ratio of pitch detection is multiplied by the value n, this is equivalent to the value n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used, so that the map file does not have decimal decimal.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM provides that a keyboard, which is to play a sound higher with the value 4096, to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards up to one octave is higher to play. to try out the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit of & kmid; trying to try out.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole set of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboard, you can see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. if you have changed a instrument, the knob is not longer green but red, to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to view the played tones. you choose the menu settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed display shows the speed that is played with a song. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you can find a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow down. to change the pace, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a music piece. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can get rid, & kmid; but use a similar sound quality. however, a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and a good synthesizer. in addition to a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have the control over all.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid. that happens because & kmid; without AWE support has been compiled. to eliminate the problem, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I have no desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore it supports & kmid; drag & drop. open the folder that you want to add in & konqueror;, choose all files from, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, activate the setup Automatic Add to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary data collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can switch the arrow button to the left from Tempounding LCD to slow down playback. to restore the default tempo, you can click on the LCD double click.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -Desktop a &-queror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; in this way, if I want to play a MIDI file (if I want to play a MIDI file) or I want to play a file, just change to the & koncross; -window and select the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only if you want to add a file, without a collection, turn the setup Automatic adding to the collection, and the new file format will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. so you only want to play the first file. so set the setup Automatic adding to the collection and open your temporary data, then it contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then unlock the B.mid and C.mid play and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or I see postcard, this people will animate me on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; I studied mathematics at the University of Maver.Laga. at the moment I'm not much free time for my hobbies, but I'm trying to score a bit time. as Hobbies, I have collecting MIDI files, make music and phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / karaoke files if you have a question or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write to me an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really would like to send me a great joy when you send a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you send a postcard or MIDI file, I'll contact you to friends from & kmid; but you should contact me with me since I might have the file maybe already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my leisure and does not have any money's money. I therefore want to emphasize that I only manages to move your feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">One sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM device or a AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have any soundcard, you need to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -Mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to set the preferred connections under the menu. but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that will be played after each other, you should use the category Durable playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierapostle. if you were an entry, his group and all his subsets are copied to the current category and playback begins with the requested entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and Daurety playlist can also be changed through a direct editing, but also by applying itself. for example, the various files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer /, can also choose from the menu click, and next processing mode. by clicking on a subgroup, the XML content is displayed only.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you must choose from the menu to the same with playlist and choose either the processing mode, or select a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when processing mode is left or another group is selected without leaving the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can be turned on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and sending can be disabled through the editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can simply be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate any other animation. & kmplayer; the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / Exit.xml should be aware that format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at start does not need to be short, it will be automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end-animation but the user can end the application a second time.</seg>

<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data Rekorder) Settings in the kmplayer is the dialog for Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be ports detected, i.e. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name will probably contain a DVB sensors.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use Xvideo (presumably this type of play of video devices under Linux is the only the only works). this is also only supported on the first screen (: 0.0). for the XFree86 server it is necessary to include the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1731">Are there any indications, as I can make my CDROM drive, if I lose from it (not from the VCD file: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is configured as user root after the integration of the device. it is absolutely safe to make that / dev / cdrom feature the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does each time my CPU have to be checked for their performance?</seg>

<seg id="1789">DVI; is a small file format (English D e V ice I nally). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the reading of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converting and computer screen TVs.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as needed for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can be printed (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar offers the conversion of DVI; -file into other formats. once the DVI; -file from the & latex; source text is created, the conversion can begin by adding other formats by means of the button bar.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Once you click on the appropriate button in the toolbar, a window will appear for selecting the referral template for the document. the default settings are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a single document, a document may be written either from the ground or the assistant to the fast creation of a new document. more information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">The users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either a existing & tex; - / latex; file created or a new file created. & kile; can create a new template via the document of an existing document and a selection of file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using file New, some strings may be replaced by other data (e.g. name or drawing encoding). these variables are set up in Settings... settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating the own template, it is therefore necessary to know which character strings are replaced by the variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this character string is replaced by entering a document class. typically, they will be used for maize:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the Assistant and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps were finished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can organise your own template instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. a simple way to create a template should be searched for one in the internet and searched among described steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kate; uses & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate. is a text editor for programmer with the possibility of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many attitudes for & Kate; can be made directly from & kile; you can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate. for more, the manual should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; can be done directly by reading the chapter on & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; -instruction reference, which can be called for the menu to the LaTeX reference. you will contain an exceptional description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>

<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibility to browse the various types of spring textures and these proposals. for example, the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are distinguished by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can be accounted for. this is an own kind of bookmarks within the text. this option is highlighted the jump to the nave or last jumping mark. this is also highlighted by the jumps on the first input of a drawing, so that it will automatically be applied to the first input of a drawing.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The work is probably one of the main aspect of using a program such as & kile; although & Kate. already excellent value for the writing of a & latex; textures always many environments and groups and therefore underline supplies which are necessary. under processing, the following commands are included in the text area:</seg>

<seg id="1823">With this command, towards the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is placed before or within the command\\ Begin {surroundings), towards the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">During the input of many founted ambient commands, this command can be lost quickly. this command assures the last modified environment, so that the inherited environmental structure is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also special orders for the & latex; groups, which are determined by staples {...} are intended. under BeWork TeX group are some important commands that meet the surrounding areas.</seg>

<seg id="1828">With this command, towards the end of the current group conversations (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed straight behind the attached clamps.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the welded structure of a & tex; -Group # is at the other end of the group conversations (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">During the input of many spaced groups, groups of clamps can quickly perish quickly. this command is close to the most covered group, so the inherited structure of the & tex; groups cannot be confused.</seg>

<seg id="1942">Remarks are special comments in documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Note is simple. it may choose either the note-entry from the Editor-context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment zone, followed by notices text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Note that a particular member of the team may be sent. in this case, the name @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), plays a role in the project from the following options: team leader, Subproject manager, following the enriching and subproject guides, should be given the corresponding range or subproject names, as in the examples below.</seg>

<seg id="1956">Mime types: Mimetypes for identifying various types of files. using the default setting the default settings can be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default Drawing coding: encoding of newly created or in other way than with file opening open files (where encoding the file can be ignored), but this setting is unloaded by the same in the project features, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is emitted by the same in the project features, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantitative aplus; creates regularly securing copies, so that with a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. also for yet unsaved documents, a backup is created, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editorial area or their own view (or documentation in a carteireiter), what makes it possible to view the documentation, viewing and source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1971">Component of the "Only" mode "mode: check if the plugin can refuse to store. only-Read-KParts usually refuse to load when this option is not chosen.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: is it activated, then test & quantitative aplus; if the entered information is correct. you can also select the store, if the plugin at the moment is not available, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantitative aplus; since version 3.3, the troubleshooting was completely redesigned. DieSupport for the not required built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was adjusted, as well as the support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented, which allows various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plug-in available, support for the use of & gubed; inquantitative aplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Use of the debugger for a project starts with selecting a matching debugger plugins in the project settings. with the button options beside the debugger plugin selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled, some additional elements appear in the & quantitative aplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that is displayed in the content of displayed variables. usually in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view that all holding point, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view that is shown in the output (as shown in HTML) of the Debugger. usually in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the Debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to debug, if required, or it divides the plugin with you to listen to debugging. this promotion is opened by default, that a debugger will not be considered.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt & quantitative aplus to your needs, and how you can help & quantitative aplus; help to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Documentment units (DTEP; s) are used in & quantitative aplus; to give support for marking and scripting languages as well as & CSS; your simplicity and flexibility makes it a quick, user friendly & IDE; for webdeveloper, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag file and the toolbars. tag toolbars contain two file types, the text and instructions faster into a document as one user could include.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created suspended (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see details for converting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, A & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property for the day. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; self-toolbars allow a fast insert of tags in a document without any loss of a writing system.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are nothing as a folder. you can only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder support the name of the editor language and version, present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML, and declare if they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so many users have a better viewing and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limits are described in simple ways.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root modelelement of a TagXML document. it can only occur only once in a document, but it can contain the definition of many tags, but there is nothing else than that.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Type of tags is a script function. when using it, attr &gt; an argument of function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the day class class. the name of the basic class for this class (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the Type Method. gives the name of the class where this method is heard. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has added common attributes and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; -day. this is a only element element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes a attribute an tags. this element can only occur once for each attribute. additionally, it lays down the name and the type of attribute. additionally, it contains further tags that describe how this attribute is to appear & etc; This is a merely element element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source codes for the attributes in the tag editor and on Attributes tree to</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. dcop interface within & quantitative aplus; is used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantitative aplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an intersection and method name. the arguments that can be handed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, that means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day put together the elements of a list. it can occur only once for a attributes. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Puts the position of the attribute textured an tags within a dialog. this day can occur for each attribute in a dialogue only once (e.g. for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be present for each field in dialogue (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the use of defined tags. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that complete a day. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with & XML; Declaration begin: & lt; XML version = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 encoding = 1.0-8? &gt; and must be properly coupled and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces are not influence on & & & lt; signs. these should be made by & amp; and & lt;, particularly in elements such as & lt; Toolbox &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files is the tools dialog up in the & quantitative aplus; -window to start and check the TagXML. choose a further dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. at present, check only with the loading of the TagXML files in & quantitative aplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt-scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name is to be schematic tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example for an functioning family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP-file is described. the file name of this day XML file is to be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; day name = "function" rebreType = "" "" name "type =" string "status =" optional "/ &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / day &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be edited by DTD uses DTD settings. thus, diedessec; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be prepared for a newly created & DTEP; should be prepared with following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] Version = use 1 for & quantitative aplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD-indication. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can be set up with settings... to be created. click New action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned to the CTRL button. with clicking the button User may be assigned to a key shortwave, with Kone is the current keyboard graceable.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text in the detailed settings can be entered and in the execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that the document may change or use as input (or parts of the document); himself are the quick start-dialog or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% skript.sh.This way attempts to find & quantitative information: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file names are: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative aplus; only one instance is running, the text must be assigned to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantitative aplus; used by the remote script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the date of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above-mentioned methods, a script will receive inputs of & quantitative aplus; in the default area, input can be determined, which can be determined to the default account. possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="2036">The selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be derived. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the default output. it can be specified, which is specified to the default output release by selecting the text box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in the case there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">As soon as a toolbar add, you need to add actions and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom end of the window will start edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all, if the day has attributes and you can plan your use, activate the dialog "Tag," when available, with an input when using action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is it an ugly symbol. who should remember the action with this icon? if we replace it before we trouble difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the promotion represents better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & kicone;, graphics further programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose size and others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day started, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually used as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to user interface, click here; -Day in the current document will be entered.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating a symbol it must still be connected to the action. this is done by the menu with settings of action... (in & quantitative aplus;) and selecting the desired action. apart from the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so it still exists, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantitative aplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups. open the toolbars for setting the toolbars. make sure that the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the Trenner (all left above) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that will be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I wish to preview a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note the grouping of the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; knob the opposite of the Start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by test all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Save in the right folder. after reeXML is not found, it will be created in the right folder, but your toolbar (s) should be saved in the right folder, so that your toolbar (s) is loaded, if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most mentioned extension of & quantitative aplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language you like. this chapter describes how I use a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentary, you could check the & quantitative aplus; -Repository check if anyone has done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you have to let the docrc file. let's make the first part we deal here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc You = Path, relative to this file, for example PHP 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP 4.html Section 2 = # Sections Sec1 = Sec2.html tag1 = tag.html tag1 = tag.html tag2 = tag.html tag3 = tags.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the & PHP documentation here; documentation as something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config File [Tree] Doc you = php42 / # top level Elements Top element = PHP 4.2 on Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = introduction,... introduction = bal.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = tage.basic-syntaxes .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that there are no underfile in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the chess boards (except by understanding) mdash; but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the index is referenced directly to a file (and consequentally shown at the top end of the building view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces are not influence anything, but take care of & & w; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative. resourcendateries are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The active section is the range of docrc file, which is intended to be displayed in the context of a contextual help. for example, if the documentation for the mysql _ Fetch _ array function would be displayed directly. there are only two types of records here: the context list (Context List) and the file Connection.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc easily and would like to save $HOME / .kde / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc /</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you're sure that this well and it is worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation is used to use & quantitative aplus; -Repository for use by the & quantitative aplus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative aplus; you are not alone. it is possible to divide the resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can send by email to friends, partners, or else. at different places there is an email send menu entry, like DTD DTD package (DTEP) via email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where all other & quantitative aplus; users can download and only be made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for the publication. to make a useful contribution if it is guaranteed for a GPG / PGP key, which is guaranteed for our team as well as for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG keys (the Paswehrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you may check out a button (URL Preview can remain empty), and click OK with click "OK."</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the uploading of the DTD DTD package (DTEP), the toolbar will be uploading, and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before the installation, examines & quantitative determination of the resource due to examination of integrity and Signification. in case of problems warn and it may be cancelled. if the integrity is given and the resource has been signed, a message appears with the indication of the owner's website.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages which currently is not yet supported by & quantitative aplus; the creation can be needed temporarily, because hundreds of day files can be needed in tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD Load and Convert DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD-description which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitive forms: the character string that will appear on the DOCTYPE day like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, takes & quantitative aplus; following the conversion of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantitative aplus; there are some key concepts. to understand these and full use of & quantitative aplus; this chapter one tries to accommodate them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantitative. little use.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitative aplus; the working range is divided into three areas: global, locally and projected. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantitative aplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantitative aplus; uses, available. of toolbars over actions it is possible to secure the common structure of & quantitative aplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure multiple toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree that are then available to each in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of WebDevelopments for a single user. these are custom patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in user-directory, so that they only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">All elements are available only within a specific project. this may be everything from & CSS; designs up to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project. just said this is the most limited size. all items are stored in the folder tree of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantitative aplus; MDI; consists of some main areas: the editorial window, the construction views, the boxes with information and toolbars. please beat in, and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document of matching entries, such as close the current, other or all carteivers, re-load, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmarks or version of CVS commands for the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Legal click in the editorial range lead to a further context menu concerning the revised documentation, such as fundamental machining steps (cut / copy / insert), using the mouse pointer to the mouse or open the file, if the string is described under the mouse pointer a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editorial staff there are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantitative; 4.01 Transitional than standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantitative aplus; the toolbars will be adapted to the new functions and thus linked users.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; in their document then click the icon representing the day. you should add a day that has several attributes (such as anchor), insert it into a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The installation views (QIT) enable it to open to & quantitative information; to navigate to open and walk through. in the representation with carteivers are available for files, project, pattern templates, documentation structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantitative tool; providing all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, upload or deletion of files from the storage media can be done with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantitative aplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc; it's all the possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates may be divided into three categories, depending on which connections are used. the category depends on & quantitative aplus; working range. global templates are always available, local templates for the corresponding users and templates are in use only in the project. more to templates is found in.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information on the available script languages. the concept of reintegration in Global, Local and Project can also work here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can edit the available information about a script. via the right mouse button, further functions are available, like e.g. the script will send you to or send it with email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by left-click the cursor in the document to the position of the element. by right click of an element that gives a view of commands to navigation and view of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other construction views. with it, manfast attributes and namespaces can change. the modification of all available attributes with a few clicks is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for web technology to find your development. it can be downloaded-packed documentation for & quantitative determination. you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add project specific documentation, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default & quantitative aplus; two carteivers at the bottom end of the window, can be reached via the useable information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This Card shows information on any script in Quanta. such, e.g. the DTD of the latest document, and all changes to the DTD being displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cartridge reshines shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantitative scripts, which are executed, give all error messages (such as there is) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantitative aplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show it on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate sets of the toolbars is the possibility to define their own orders as symbols in & quantitative aplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantitative aplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with email. & quantitative aplus; sends the tool bar as a compressed Tar archive via & kmail; if you get a tool bar in an email, you can secure it in & quantitative aplus; as any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantitative aplus; -In order to obtain a complete list of all options, specify. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and here not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantitative aplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folders. also you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of their bin folders. same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitative aplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantitative aplus; was optimized for a rapid web development and combined a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantitative aplus started to address; what would be if & quantitative aplus; an independent, extended markup languages would be? well, this would do it for the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, & quantitative aplus; now you can define it on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool. you can then define it should be & quantitative, then should be & quantitative, for that the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the aforementioned efforts must be noted that & quantitative aplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; as follows, is the idea of what has been developed? thanks to the & kde; -report is not only this possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantitative aplus; so to expand as they need for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantitative aplus; enables web developments the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can expand the productivity almost every task. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, you can expand using a scriptural character. (more about it you will find in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was conceived for fast web development and quickly developed to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in any way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For details about the details documentation is done with help: / Quanta (either to enter this URL in & queror; enter or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia hydroantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you can open a file, which is not on it, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for later use. check in the section above templates. should try to save the selected file / Text outside the local / project backup folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Convert from the clipboard there are special characters for & HTML; -shelling, allowing them correctly and not be understood from browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; -Schabortion, which is the correct way to insert special signs and spaces in & URL; s. first line to insert & URL; s in the anchor day are used.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Allows to select the recorder to or out. this allows you to choose text blocks with the & shift; button to select.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages is available!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or SED with GUI and predefined expression to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. that's the window in which you can see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Extension and enching of the problem reporter at the bottom edge of the & quantitative aplus; main projection. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column links to the main window. this column allows you to set the wire using a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When the bookmarks in the current file, it will appear in the menu together with entries previous or nearest, depending on the position of cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu Group following the filename of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from hard disk. & quantitative aplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched the project directory to new files that could be there. that allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or a subfolder and then add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; from and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, how & quantitative aplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantitative aplus; -projects find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project tool bar. these are kept in project you / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. only actions need to be added to the name. actions are saved via tool toolbars or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars using the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the visual field. does not delete the hard drive. if you have not yet saved the tool bar, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Therefore, you can send your own tool bar to someone (perhaps at the & quantitative aplus; -Team, so the tool bar will be available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables the uploading of toolbars on the main server, where any other one can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; you have made, or anything else has made and convert into the & quantitative representation; own image format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Download / refresh the discoveries from the & DTEP; it is useful if the unloading of the & DTEP is to renew, without renew the whole & DTEP; if this globally is and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not available, loading the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default is loaded (HTML;) toolbar is available in the tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag setup dialog when there is one. this entry is available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific undermentia.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or deactivates the intelligent add-in tags. currently this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. smarter means that & quantitative attoos does not refuse to refuse the rules on this place if this day does not contradict the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">The plug-in menu are listed in the plug-in menu, the available menu entries are listed below the menu entries. click on the activated plug-in off.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntaxes control mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on derkate; -version from.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Chooses the type of line-related key. very useful if you know people using other OS platforms for developing. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the document on the selected & DTD using the external application Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant changeover between different types of user interface. due to several restrictions in the KDE libraries, the changeover time may need or unnice graphics. recommended is the card statement mode, which is also the default setting mode, or the sub-window mode, which is the presentation in & quantitative aplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu requires an entry for every open window. with a selection of a entry, the corresponding window will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantitative aplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect each application which can use the KHTML Part, including the &-queror; web browsers.</seg>
<seg id="2151">The behavior of the editorial staff. in the documentation of & Kate. find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbars or modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">That should therefore produce a help according to the mauser's environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitative aplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project you can always use help. if they want to support the & quantitative representation; development in financial form, you will find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, as after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example, foo. when entering the name, file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of & quantitative aplus; project file. by default it has the names of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can address the server address of the machine that you want to access, one, except you processed local data. either a name (hostname.examples) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If this field is empty, the default settings of the selected log is used. depending on the setup of remote computers, it could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a joint collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. when a joint collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">That allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. several files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great, if you want to change the static contents you want to change and change. at serverside scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Do not act if files are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, should be embedded in the main folder of the project. if a project is not begun at a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option will show all files and folders inside the main folder and you can make a precise selection of goodwill.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by anaft or, by removing the Häkite, out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be instantly upload in the menu with project Properties in the menu tree or with the keyword Shift; F7 changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings are described in the project assistant and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filename (placeholder possible) will be ignored in a project related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to be listed above, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view that will be loaded when opening the project, can be read more about projections.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This can be selected by the debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information on Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the options. in the setup the troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the bottom window profiles can be uploading and uploading profiles (see in), as well as the display of a construction for the content of the server for each profile by adding a dedicated building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the Team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see also details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the bottom window event configuration, you can change event actions and delete these actions, or delete this event. event actions are carried out if a previously specified event can occur, such as the backing of a file. see in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Open by default & quantitative aplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior is not affected by default.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, open the Project... from the menu Project or the Project project open from the toolbar. the dialog box will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantitative aplus; closed, the project file will automatically be saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantitative aplus; Modified files will be found. the same happens when you download a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project view is free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">File changes equally, however, the entries must open and open with... in the right mouse button in the right context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Several profiles can be chosen here. profile contains information on the place of highly permitted files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows for removing the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button appears to avoid removing the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will retain in the core memory and it is needed. this option is useful when common uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password of the disk option is not listed in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantitative aplus; many high-loading profiles can be created and the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to several servers. when editing or creating a profile is displayed this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to copy the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The Transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least, you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. usually this must not be changed except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your Angular shaft, this is either a time saving function or a danger. do not use it after your discretion. the password is not simply read on the plate, but each with programming knowledge it can easily see in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can give many views in a project that means, by simple diving of the view, several files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the current open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the menu or the project toolbar, be accessed via settings of the toolbar toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitative aplus; with which one has to do most. it helps to increase productivity but also allows adjustment of & quantitative aplus; on its own working mode.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantitative aplus; best on the menu toolbars. use and adding to the toolbar. add the toolbars below in the section add toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set either by means of the context menu (right click on the tool bar), a new toolbar may be configured as toolbar, toolbar, or toolbars, which can be specified in the dialog where actions on this or other toolbar should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a action plan (symbol) on a toolbar, additionally the entries will be removed and action displayed, which are self-explanatory to action.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings of toolbars and set settings..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially documentels, code-cutlets and files for linking. & quantitative aplus; used templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or any of the system existing directory in the template tree; Templates have in & quantitative aplus; in about the restrictions you need for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative aplus; included templates have the conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified on the start of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, so pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are normally inserted in documents via shortcuts (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are in the Ballroom under global templates. further information on templates are available in.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text documentation. on the basis of this templates may be created new documents. normally, a simple report for the purpose and organises work in a corresponding way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the basic tree under global templates. see in for more information about templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if there is not a new document based on a template but the same text range always should be inserted into documents. you can find everything about a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are available in the Ballroom under global templates. see also for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, this templates are used for all sites than templates. they are a collection of various documents, which can be arranged in a file structure, compiled into a compressed file archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantitative aplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Shape a document structure according to your (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As template as local presentation....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as the happen, note that (even if it was stored as a project position) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the Ballroom under project requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on the file as template selection as local / project templates. alternatively, the option can easily be drawn with pulling and down on the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file formats can only be used in a paddock. all file management functions can be used for purposes such as pulling and storing or insert over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click into a file tree or in the project files to create a folder on your right and secure site template, a name for the template and secure. by default, it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal oriented approach. you can create headlines and footings preference or dynamically with & PHP; create files, add or to them. in addition, some things can retain the use of templates in projects very low-green in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The presentation structure in the bottom window is based on the files created in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / Quanta / templates / templates. each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers, as stated above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To define the behavior of a folder in the map box with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is hidden once the attribute attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapted for everything except for the pediatrium. if a generic player would be set in general, except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of normal folder the Blah would appear with something like text boxes. if nothing appears, it is probably found in a ancestor.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows a set or repainted text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or floor parts for all templates for a specific project and allows a whole presentation with special headlines / foot lines a whole presentation with the matching headlines / foot lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, using the context menu (shown on the right mouse button) using a full command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitative aplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source text editor that are accessible via the menu. the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: he invites you to document a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; you can edit and edit the source code editor in which the modifications in the VPL mode can be displayed in source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor, a small green symbol symbolises the Vohembales of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editing & PHP. there is no plans to change this behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that simultaneously the changes both in the source editor and the VPL; Editor synchron runs. with pressures of F9, this mode is already active, the key transfer is shifted by the active cursor from a window to others, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; Editor and the source code is adjustable via settings Quanta. in addition to selecting from a click or automatically select the period of time. basically, the recommendation can be set automatically. basically, the recommendation can be set for fast computers and a large pot for long durability.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the processing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; Editor is also possible, as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is also possible. that is how a new document can be created with the VPL; it may change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-Tags will allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons on the column, e.g. keywords on column names and keyword keyword 2 on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the creation of pages in browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list, or delete a change over the meta elements, which is currently not supported in the meta elements.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to insert a external CSS style by clicking on the file button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The usage of the cursors is like in a text processing, possible due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaved as usual. the mark can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by pluggging and delete back or arnetting back.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags will be made in the same way through the toolbars as in the source text editor. it is too aware that the insertion of tags must be removed from previously existing identical tags if an anchor day is surrounded by text, any other ambient air must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as tables-assistant or the lists assistent are deactivated. you will work later in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the investigation of styles. in contrast to other programs for styles, the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the styles can be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; you need to compile, except & kde; nor the libxslt, libexslt and libxml libraries have already been present in a typical installation of & kde;</seg>
<seg id="2229">Grip in a template, at a site in one of xsldbg loaded styli- or xml file or at the current nodes. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb compatibility mode can be set in a given file and line number and later enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Xsldbg calculates the full path from a filename without leaflet. filename file names with relativly path to work folder con xsldbg would be downloaded for example a Stilvorce.. / en / xsldoc.xsl, is the following entry possible:</seg>
<seg id="2231">This command will be checked in some or complete agreement with a pre-order called QNAP ME or any given modal name. & eg; template's connected to every QNAP ME, which contains the template.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Each name space in the specified "QNAP ME" will be upgraded according to the rules defined by the XSL source file defined by the XSL: test1 to http: / / www.w3.org / 199 / XSL / Transform: test1</seg>
<seg id="2233">An enclosed holding point must be dissolved to the associated URI and line number. this will be automatically checked for the load of the first template by xsldbg. holding point are reexamined again after the start of each run.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Break-l & lt; FILENAMEs; & lt; LINENOgt; nbsp; nbsp; (last a holding point in the specified file and line number)</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for compare, so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contribution made many changes, and at the same time, a further programmer had changed in the same file a lot of text. the result was numerous conflicts in collision.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no hints referring to the places, where perhaps only the insertion was changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences in one line and modifications to white characters. later, any amount of other useful features were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare this example quickly, copy it into clipboard and add it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and mergers of folders. this function related & cdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way combination is fully supported. this is useful if two persons are independently of one piece of code and changes. the original file (the base) helps to process the dissolving result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you with the comparisons and merge-up folders. this screen photograph shows & kdiff3; at the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& diff3; shows the exact differences and leaned the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you are often checked, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are visible. if lines only distinguish only in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a look at the summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble when no one changes the reading.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other distinguishes itself in one line, then the colour indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can simplify the tipping work by simply write the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder with diff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows to manually tap the selection of filename, the selection of file formats (file...) or select a recently opened file from the list. you need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences are carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also choose a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merge folders will be selected, for B and C, however, a file then uses & kdiff3; the filenames from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If collusion is active, the input field is active for target and process. however, it is not necessary to define a output file as soon as possible. you can also finish this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup knob opens a dialog with settings. here you can set the options before you start with the comparisons / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes one would not want to compare all the file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. when opening, you don't need to select the dialog box with the setup button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and finish: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind? sometimes it contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions, you would need to create two appropriate files that would need to copy them in & kdiff3; now you can copy and compare these relevant sections. now you can compare and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can extract anything from & kdiff3; extract. only the game can be supported in a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors can interpret the drave and put text into another program as sample and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the info screen. the info screen of the source window contains characters A, B or C, the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window. (if the path is too long), let the mouse button for a while on the line. then a small relief window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three spring windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (this default settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one sees the color, which file differs. if both files are different, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that is in the next section (merge) good too.</seg>
<seg id="2306">In addition to the text, the column is displayed. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters is only relevant in strings and comments, for the processor and in a few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the clutches column from the text, is interrupted in the positions where the respective source file has no lines. if the line is activated, the line will be displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison chart) also has a info line with the inscription edition:, the filename and [Geaschanges] if you have handled the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been dissolved, the store is deactivated!!! (use the buttons to next post / unsolved opposition to find the yet remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative values are used, each difference must be solved manually at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By a click with the left mouse button in a window, the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed in all windows, where the beginning of the group is not visible. (this group will be highlighted by the beginning of the group.) This group will be highlighted by the colour background color for current and on the left comes a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes stays through automatic merging or manual editing, no other line is left in the group; this is only a placeholder for the case that you may change your mind and might not return any other source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, yet in a mark which may might copy and insert it differently.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge tracking, however, appears in clipboard if you copy such text from the net windows. continue carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources the options are ignored or ignores C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are treated as white sign.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will also be shown mainly with the image bars and mouse, but you can also use the keys on the left, right, high, runder, side down, at the end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-end, Siw you can also be used by other programs. the overlts column can be used in addition to the vertical pixel pitch can also be used for navigating.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window you can also use the other buttons to work. with the Insert button, you can switch between feet and outdoor-shift mode. (default is set-down mode)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summary column is synchronized the view of all windows in the beginning of the respective group (as in the section) and the editable exit window was explained.</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar includes seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-bottom / Ctrl picture downward) or to the next / previous inoccluding conflicts. therefore, all non-automatically soluble conflicts must be regarded as conflict. therefore, it must be distinguished between soluble and unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into clipboard, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insert). if this option is enabled, you will automatically copy the clipboard and copy the manual copy. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally write the contents of clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilencores are saved according to the underlying operating system\\, and Win32-based systems use Car-based\\\\. Kdiff3 reserves the line-up of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The files and list of the last used files will be stored automatically and reproduced at the next start. (menu Insulation &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use this.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you disable this option, differences are displayed in cursive script. if the chosen font does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rolled out. on these systems, the button settings will automatically set an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the tabulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the return on the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, every selection will be automatically copied to clipboard. manual copy in clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which Zeilenende type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In the comparison of files tried & kdiff3; first to find all identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters are ignored every line. in this step, white signs are not ignored. in this step, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car back sign '\' at the end of a row, but then you could save files with different sizes on the side-on-side comparison, although they vary differently. if this option is enabled, the car changes have been deactivated, but as a white character is deactivated. during operation, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">The default option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result the differences are displayed nevertheless, but they will be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The default option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after still looking for smaller differences. the option is activated in the default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow to very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic set-up mode, setting this setting, how long the result of the selection is displayed, before the coming of the coming conflict is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically dissolves all the conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if you need to ignore the selectivity A / B / C for all unsolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatically selections are disputed in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignored C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter to the scan of folders and guides a merge. see for details on documentation on the list compare and merge tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version of the suffix file is attached to the suffix. original exists, it will be deleted without backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjusts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you need to stop & kdiff3; it is not available that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set global over the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if one enabled this option, the entries will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for encoding is a short notice that the local coding is. (this cannot be changed) and has an informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters is treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have handled a file, you can define what encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing operations, they could not work with your codec. (for example, your files might have 16-bit Unicode, but the default tool command can only handle encoded using 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can fix the coding of the output of forcing operations.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress highlighting changes in white characters in the text or oversight. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignored C / C + + judgement.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is available only if you compare three files. in normal mode all differences in a colour coded oversafer column are displayed. however, you may only see the differences between two of three files. to choose from A & B; B & B & B & B; C will be displayed next to the normal still a second overlay column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. don't simply use the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison windows next to each other. this may also be useful to ads of long lines. (this option is on the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes consider the differences and decide to summarize the files. a simple click brings together the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as the default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is displayed first to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor, which is exactly your needs. you can use this function e.g., for cut-out parts or correct to correct loading.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this external command (see above), then the output of the command is specified only by line. the command of the command is only identical with the line. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it is to enable more flexibility when teaching the Diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users would like to program the good news. however, the good news is that in most cases SED or perl are completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for Zeilenabdirectly to the input in uppercase letters: SED's /\\ U\\ 1 /\\\\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergent expression on each string and therefore refers to the found text in the first clung. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to automatically generated character strings (info: / cvs /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with SED, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expressions even. you are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignored of numbers actually is a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further pre-processing command for Zeilenabequal. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' ['and'] 'is a suitable matches, and any hits will be replaced by nothing but quasi-deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several terms at once. then you can use the Semikolon '; use it to separate the requirements of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead SED you can also use something different such as perl -e's / REGEXP / enforcement / switches' allergen needs some details differently. where SED\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor are retained for displaying and merge. furthermore, the further operations do not change the data that the line is equal to algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal processor, the line remote processor sees the output of the normal pre-processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but as with any function which changes the text, or differences, you can't notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmer must process many files in a file. for this reason you can compare and merge complete folders with & kdiff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... for every object a proposal to merge; you can customize the suggestion before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the simulate and show the simulated changes without they really do,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... select selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is the comparisons and merge of individual files very similar. you need only file the folder on the command line or the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If there are three folders, folder 1 is used as base. if no target folders was specified, used & chdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start, not the merge. to press the merge, you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you can find a small message window over the current progress. if you start scanning the folders, only the files will be listed until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scan of the folder is complete, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder found during the Scan can be displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click here.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The file structure is normally folded. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the menu or by clicking the arrow buttons for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all subdirectories and can fold all the directories with which you can open all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double to a file, the file comparison will start and there will be a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the chosen object is visible. in such a case, the collhr action plan can not be chosen automatically. if the collision is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colours are red, green, yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries are different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Stewards are identical as identical if its total content is identical. then folders also have the same color. at folders, the age is quite considerable for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirts. colors reflect the colors of a sheet, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and a file is): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faulty objects, the collation cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B cannot have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and a file is): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faulty objects, the collation cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active if only two folders and no explicit targets have been specified and if the option is synchronize directories. then select & kdiff3; the required action is identical, so that both files are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: assemble and save the result into both folders. (the user can look as the visible data names for the output file only B; directly after collision and defle3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders can be merged and select the new file instead of merging (unsafe), then try & kdiff3; the date of files are differently, but the date is identical, but the date is identical.. Solange are not fixed, the cladding can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, a file is working after the other. you state-column shows off when the collation was successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected failures, you should make a final review, and see if the status is in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If set-on dialog the file's comparative analysis is selected, Kdiff3 will show further columns. this contains the number of exermonasteries, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for soldered conflicts will be shown only when three folders can be compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the selected entry (file or Odner) or all entries at one time. if you have selected all the merge orders (also in all sub-folders) you can start collision.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folder, then in the three-folder merge mode C, it will be used as the target and synchronize A and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries must be displayed in the target folder, there are some options to be displayed in the file structure. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To summarize all entries: select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard graf). to carry out the current item: select the action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the case of contradictory file types still exist, a message appears that the defective items will appear. you can then select a valid promotion for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you lead all entries, a dialog window will appear with the options, simulating and breaking off.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate If you would like to see what would happen, without the really changes, you will then get a detailed list of all the actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& diff3; then causes certain actions with all entries due to all entries. if a manual input is necessary (merge a single file) then a merge window opens (please note the screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready with a file, select the directory entry again and press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialogue appears. then, & kdiff3; his work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed Status information. at the end of the list see some error messages that will help you to try or to try the problem of problem. so, you have the option to select a different action for the entry or enter the problem in any way before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If several entries have been merged, notice & kdiff3; this entries (in the current session) and performs them together with all entries. even if the merge updates are taken or not saved, these entries are considered to be done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; Kdiff3) has now a section called folder merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are displayed on the sample are displayed in the element tree. several samples can be entered. separate placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is * .folders do not need to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than one sample, use the Semikolon; as a partition. valid Order: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than one sample, use the Semikolon; as a partition. valid Order: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files which are also ignored by CVS. many built-in files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore).</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files have a hiding -attribute. in other file systems you may choose a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When links to files: if the option is switched on, symbolic links are compared to. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links are disabled. this is deactivated by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When links to the file: if the option is switched on, the links are treated like normal files and recursively searches. (note that & kdiff3; do not lead on possible records. (note that this option would lead to a final loop and chill 3; crashes) This option is shut down in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, invents, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and significantly slower, if they do not contain any text. (specify an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folders through a slow network, it is possible to compare only the change date and the file size. however, this speed advantage will be worth a certain degree of safety. please be careful with caution. this option is set in the default value.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison instead. the files will be regarded as identical if in copying the change date has lost. please be careful with caution. this option is set in the default value.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronize mode if two folders can be compared and no target folders. in this mode, the suggestions concerning merge settings are selected so that both folders are identical. this option is shut down in both folders. this option is set in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead the copying of the newer file as action. (this is considered unsafe, because the other file is not changed too. you should check this in any case.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or file is replaced by a different file, then the original version is renamed, then the extension .original. if a old backup file is already established with the .original extension, this will also be deleted without any backup. this option is enabled in default. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge tool would result in the merge of individual files; you can switch the window distribution with the mouse. if you do not want that option to switch the directory & text windows, switch the main window in the window menu and switch between directory & text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably, you prefer to compare a file simply by double click, but if you can drive a single file directly, you can use the current file merge in the directory menu. once you use the result, the status is set to be done and the file will not be merged again when you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is however lost when you read the directory again: directory menu: new to read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open your files and folders based on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">One URL has another syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively. or.. contain. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, idle, &gt;% 20, etc.), for example, has a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes on the server system, sometimes caused by the protocol, a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder. then, a file is always adopted as a link goal. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit permissions or change date. therefore we soften the permissions or change date from the original. (note the option truest in the size.) (This is only possible with local files)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main use of the main use is currently in KDevelop. KDevelop first always starts the built-in differences viewer. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select in Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Typically I need & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as Kpart, takes & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the generation of Patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part thereof, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merge or the same from folders will not be supported in the Kpart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is composite). furthermore, the name KDiff3 shows that it can lead collusion such as the diff3 program from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL software programs very long and I have learned a lot in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone on this road or let him go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from sources compiled and configure the configure script to KDE. in the default settings installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for user interfaces (e.g. coldiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters differently, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is treated differently, the line will be treated as non-identical. if all Lines has received the next to Each other, this toll is the balis of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is referring to any difference in the files where he begins and where it ends. this important information goes to the source and select the button in the source file and select it is too much effort to design an extra's own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for it was so far too big. you can always restore a specific version of selecting a source A / B / C. to process larger amounts of the text should be used any other editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly light; No src liners; released and the text is not extinguish. what does it mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& diff3; used already many colors to emphasize differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and troubleshooting from colleagues and many people from the game Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To utilize all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE, you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes will be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the changelog file in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the basic folder of & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-yourself gives the folder installed in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsafe, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have any problems with compiling. nevertheless, consult difficulties, please report on the & kde; -Mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift Delete) in the clipboard and deletes the marked text. add (Ctrl-V or Shift Insert) add the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaces the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders can not appear in the file structure, and consequently not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to update changes to these options to update the folder with the update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries indicated that have the differences. even if the target folders can not be copied to the target folder. if the target folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after collision. (the behaviour is plugged in a later program version.) This option is shut down in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note buttons to choose from the source with label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding windows are attached to the end of the selected group (if they are not already present), if the lines are already available, click on the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">By default, this option is deactivated. difference in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a preview of all virtual working surfaces. it's quite convenient to see the running programs on working surfaces to stop them or shift them. this works both within a desk than in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual desktops and the running applications. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the medium-mouse button, window can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible both within a desk and other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on it, where the right mouse button is clicked on: if on the empty background of & kpager; if, however, the context menu will only be clicked on the symbol and the name of the application, as well as entries, maximize, on desktop and sending. the commands are the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of desktop. appears only when click on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to selected virtual desktop. appears only if you click on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, window can be moved within the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces can be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, the & kpager will be shown in the name of virtual desktops.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross the field can be crossed the & pager; the numbers of virtual desktops. is to be crossed with name, will be named with ordained names, & eg; 1. Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background each desk is also displayed as background in & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When the field is crossed, the current programs are displayed as small windows in the & kpager; otherwise, only the empty workspace will be displayed to enable the selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its standard symbol and graphic map shows a small view of real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager can be determined: classic leaves & kpager; in a 2xn grid, such as pager applications appear in some other windows; horizontally shows all virtual working surfaces in a horizontal and vertical in a vertical series, which is very well suited to the side of the desktop on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniprogram in the Control bar. it has the advantage that it can display in the size to display the window as symbols or with their content and it runs outside the Control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent selecting from switch to switch... lets the dialog for Settings will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this can't be changed in the dialog for Settings .You can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you have no write permission for the file, you need to register as a user root or enter your system administrator to your system administrator. in this file you need to register the key windowtransparent mode and indicate that value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly being extended by new features. it is optimised for use on performance-weak machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you can start & kmag; a window as pictured above. the main window of screen saver is shown. in the following window, this window appears as a magnification window. in the following window, this window appears as a magnification window is the enlarged area of the screen and is described below the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting it is increased & kmag; the range around mouse pointer as a mobile microscope. alternatively, you can easily obtain a selected screen range in the magnifying window (selection mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer on the screen (eg; on the left screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">Want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer. please note that it is not capable of recognizing the mouse pointer. this is always the default kde; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection box mode, you can move the selection window to your needs. you can move it with arrows and mouth buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following ways:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can move the contents of the magnifying window and move. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you are adding the & shift; button or press & MMB; use the option to move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection process will remain and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; possesses a lot of functions. you can store the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), turning the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Once or stops the updating of the ad. stop the updating that the needed CPU time is against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the refresh rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very high). the higher the refresh rate, the more CPU time is required.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window will appear. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& kmag; automatically uses your introduced short notice for saving files, opening a new window, print, neulads (with the button document again loading in & konqueror;), Enlarge and Verminers & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Can also be known as & kmagnifier; it is a screen magnifier. you can use & magnifier; to use a magnifying glass in a newspaper or a photo. this application is intended for different people of benefits: from research or artist up to Webdesigner or secluding.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse provides a while on the same spot. it is intended to help people suffering from the RSI syndrome (repetitive coupling syndrome) and which each mouse click pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse provides a while on the same spot. it is intended to help people suffering from pain. additionally, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. this requires little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool is able to handle the pain when clicking the mouse, and helps cause many people to cause the computer without pain. unfortunately, you suffer from pain that use your computer when using your computer, you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it once more clear: even if & kmousetool should avoid pain that causes the mouse to be created with the mouse, it is against pain, which is caused by the mouse because of the mouse, use it as well as for all the ergonomic support.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click, as soon as you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent shift is activated, making & kmousetool; a break after the pressing of the mouse button. move it up to the end of movement, before the batter requires a little exercise, but you get used to get rid of it fast.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be sufficient after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click brings you.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the shift is switched on, the rotary controller is active (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool is waiting, before the mouse button is waiting, before the mouse button appears once again, if there is no need for the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the clicking through mouse button. if this function is activated, a slow down to the right and back, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. a slow handle is stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / mmousetool _ kmousetool; the first time is started, but it can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can move it & kde; at this time, take the & kcontrolcenter;, go to sound & multimedia, choose the sound system and there the rider General. there is a sliding buffer of sound buffer, which you can set up a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool is started; at each start by & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments, please send the relevant documentation to find out how to launch a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all the settings on the values which have been set when opening the dialog. already, when opening the dialog, you have already pressed the button users to reset the settings according to the last pressing of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; initially, use the default settings. in particular, smart shifting should first be switched off. if you have to accustomed to the automatic mouse, you may later use the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window, that doesn't display link, does not bring to unintentional reactions. you can also park the mouse to such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is printed, you should clean your mouse. that's normally quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. as it happens, mouse is different from mouse to mouse. it should be quickly clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the Loches, where the ball was used. the dirt and the soiling can easily crater with a flat blade or fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system starts the execution of & kmousetool; if you just started an imminent building. in this case, it means the intelligent shift, this means that & kmousetool does not cause any more to end the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this is the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue to work.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to perform mouse click and put the cursor into another passage.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Workaround: use the mouse to place the cursor there you want. but if you don't want to make your mouse on a neutral area of your desktop, if you don't like to make any key mouse click unintentional reactions. safe zones for mouse pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menu and the cover lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with an intelligent shift, but I do not create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Intelligent relocating is a advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to move it into the clipboard, and to move into any other action, where you will probably prepare your mouse over the pressed mouse button. here are some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the intelligent shift if you just need to start & kmousetool; for example, select text instead as follows: perform at the end of the text area, and hold the switch-down button pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button appears again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always see when & kmousetool is played, the mouse button presses the sound like a mouse button. later you can use the intelligent shift even without the audible mouse click. however, it requires little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">In order to be able to use & kmousetool; the XTest extension for & X Window has to be installed. this should be the case in most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeakers are set up properly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool is a mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer was perched. this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome, and to which the patient understands pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool can also be configured that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling step before the mouse button is left out. in this way also the pulling and dislay with the mouse can be carried out.</seg>

<seg id="2622">In order to understand the working of filtering, it is important to know how the program "Camera-dispatcher" works with a text. & distinguishes among four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The edition of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it will be preferred to all other orders and hold these orders. if the edition of the screen readers will be read, the orders will continue resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings are the next priority. this level is important news, such as & eg; processor is too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text. these orders will be resumed after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have a better priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that can be used. while you & eg; a long text on a web page can be read with & kmouth; someone welcome you just the room. & kde; -messages are also news. read this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text applications. each order that you get from the Card card jobs, is a text contract. KSayit is an example of applications that are dedicated to text applications. text orders are meant for the issue longer term texts that possess any special maningness.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are reworked in queue, with the exception of the edition of Screen Readers. when an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktops; just such a reads, this issue will be stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied on normal warnings, news and text messages as well as on & kde; -messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter process the text and enter it on the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filter are available as modules. in the future, there may be more types of filters in the future.</seg>

<seg id="2731">You can then keep text contracts on the card card or cancel, even if the synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set of proposition is automatically set up when you start reading mons for the first time. it cannot be removed only. change nothing at this filter, unless you do what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">The propositional detection filter compare text with a regular expression of propositional and add a tabulatory character (Decimal number 8) to set spacing (Decimal number 8) before filtering automatically from the text). note that the default propositional approval filter retains the drawing.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -messages (k.), alarms, messages, or the output of Screen-Readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have a check of the normal movement detection filter, you can add this again by inserting the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For the installation of the binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one & console; using rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool can be used with graphical surface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde; not sufficient, but additionally, the development packages with libraries and others will be needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is not only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; to compile the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology will be discussed, in the second all of & knetworkconf; configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot replace more information about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information on the integration of the PC can be conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv4 5 has never found great spread. from IPv6 there is no major spread over the near future. therefore, this description focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge that the IP address of a network interface is asible. on & eg; Workstation is the network administrator to be used or, if available, DHCP can not simply be chosen individually.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When putting a own small (home) network the IP address should be chosen from a specially designed range for this purpose to avoid IP address settings with the global (Internet) network. addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be made by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks mostly addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large for networks up to 250 computers large enough.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the mask masks usually will be reduced to 255.255.255.0, so all calculators are on the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.004; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called Standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the default route is required for the IP-line.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed in DSL connections, so it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections a different content is set to be found there.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a security program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a band. the first goal was to create a surface for tar, the second purpose was the answer to a question that asked my wife: how much longer takes it when you secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & kdat; it may happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">If the band returns and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detects and kdat; the fallback on the band will not be asked if the band will be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the leader, search for the matching index on your plate. can't be found if the index index is new to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything has gone smooth, changes the symbol for the tape drive to indicate that the band is mounted. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to the throw of the belt, the integration must first be resolved. there are three methods to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As a result of a change in symbol for the band, the integration could be solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be cast without risk.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat can be used, it must be formatted from & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band of band must be formatted before you can use the formation of data. this process does not need to be formatted with & kdat; this process must be done before using the band of & kdat; it must be formatted before using the band of & kdat; floppy tape drives usually do not require a formatting of the tape, DAT drives on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity drives & kdat; all the data on the band are lost, all the data on the band is lost automatically! after completion of the formatting process, the band is automatically engined and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you must choose to choose the files that are done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or the folder is secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a safe profile in the tree. only the files are secured in the profile.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a bunch. only the selected files and / or folders will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is entered, the dialog for backup is opening up. in this dialogue, you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears to backup. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archive in the entry for the drive. it is checked only the selected file or the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archive in one of the entry for the band with a bunch. only the selected files and / or sub-folders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has started, the dialog for verification. in this dialog you can check your selection once and change the folder to review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog appears to check out the progress of the test process as well as data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initialize the restore, the files that are to be restored, may be marked on two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry of the tape drive. it will be restored only the selected file or folders.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archive with a bunch. only the selected files and / or folders can be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu bar....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore procedure has started, the dialog for Restoration. in this dialog, you can check your selection once and change the folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialog appears to restore. this dialog displays the progress of recovery process and the remainder of the time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it shows itself as necessary to create the tape index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is created a secure profile with the straight marked files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a secure profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current workfolder in which the backup should be carried out. the list of files will be updated automatically according to the selected workfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the folders that are listed under backup files, only those files are saved on the same file system, such as the folder. file that can be found on other file systems, you can use separately under backup files. each entry is independent of tar independent from the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is secured. only the files have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling the tar. this causes all files to be secured and created a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files; s; and lt; lapping; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings on the menu item KDat... in the menu settings. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path for the tape drive for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the tape tool.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the band is bound to the drive. with some drives, this is necessary before reading or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, it tries to lock and try to lock off the tape drive. maybe this setting does not work with all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when triggers the integration of & kdat; automatically the tape automatically disclosed. use this option not with floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & dat; the hardware-related block size for tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need to use & kdat; in any case the block size for your belt drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; a band is formatted, writing a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only be one memory block on the band. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this character is username: seconds, whereby the name of the complete name of the system is formatted on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number seconds that has been formatted by the epoch in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to use a file named in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar -archives that can be administrated directly with & GNU; - tar. even more tar versions should work, as long as it is not for incremental fuses.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tool. this symbol is only active if a tape is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystem log; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, where you can obtain information on your system or where the system allows you to obtain information about your system or, for users with fast access, for example information on problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& nSystems log; helps users to understand what your machine makes in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can get information on your system or where the system is stored in the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, it allows key system log; experienced users to perform quick access, for example information on problems related to their server. it therefore tries to provide some advanced functions, with which help the protocol files can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & C. Systems log has a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of protocol files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition and will be explained in further chapters of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, the login system log is made available, with their help you can easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & try system log; first attempts to open the system protocol - it will not be displayed, and it opens instead of its small message window, so you've found & ksystem log. the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually do not own permissions for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter the selected filter bar. in addition, the list box is displayed next to the filter bar. in addition, the list box is displayed next to the filter. in addition, a protocol line will be displayed only when in one of the columns you find the character string of the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select any other entry at this point. in addition, the string of the filter search term is then drawn only with entries in accordance with selected columns. then, for example, in the filter bar code, select the login page log; all protocol lines that were sent from this process or created.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a displayed color as protocol lines of Level Note. the color display of protocol lines may be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (for example in system protocol or in cron protocol), you can then use the process identification (PID) in the column process as you would like to examine the issuance of a certain command as for example to the start of the Samba server. in this case you use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to allow all new added protocol lines to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">The login system log; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate understands. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open additional subwindows and manage. as soon as you have selected a window, select a protocol for displaying the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& nSystems log; has its own website to http: / / ksSystems log.forum-software.or.Dort you will find further information about the supply of the log system log.</seg>
<seg id="2955">And log's log; also will be found in the following folder of & kde; -Subversion-Archive: ksystem log; see & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init editor, rather well known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init rapidly evolved to the standard for control of the program starts at the start of the system in the & Linux; and because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD option.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go on historical aspects here (among others because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone might try to introduce a machine on System V init, without a new installation and re-format. therefore, you must be sure that the old init was removed from there, if there was there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc are instead directly in / etc. this folder is called rc..Dort you will find rc.synoit and following a further folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole set of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service which you would like to start reading system or change to another runlevel. system services include such items such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services include not such items such as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie down among / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also do a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runoff level is in / etc / inittab. you should see line like the following in the initial segment:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre-set runlevel 3. if you want to change at the inittab changes, then you can repair anything, then you will repair it by restoring the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it begin to enter all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this file. instead, each entry is a link to a scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written that it is an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start scripts from hand on the command line like this:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would keep the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called with the argument. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I may have & eg; a server running level, that can run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; you could also have a user level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to trivial to trivial: draw a entry out of the field of availability system services to one of the six round level to run it on this level (or stop or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move the scripts between Runleveling or modify the position within a level. this is the entry from its original runlevel (or its position). this happens only if it occurs an entry from the field of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are postponed, if you have to move this into a new zone if you only need to select copying from the menu click or from the context menu -- even if the next entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry may not be calculated sometimes. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to inert system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no possibility to restore the entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the various work ranges (Available, runlevel 1 Start, runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection - or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move one entry into another round level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired round level by inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of one entry manually, press the tab button to switch between different fields. use the tab button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss require all entries in the menu file a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) is taken if it is available. otherwise, they will be saved from & ksysv. changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard laptops, and now the machine starts continuously new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution using runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, such as system services are started, simplifies the configuration for proprietary investments in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv are planning to extend the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check whether all configuration files are required (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are just retrieved without a message if your configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
