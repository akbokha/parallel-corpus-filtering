although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would have been living there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extremely big .
how many of my generation I grew up with American films , I have read American music , American authors , and operated by his sport .
in fact , this country had a pro@@ found effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
when I saw 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Letter , a fe@@ ar@@ ful repor@@ ter , who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura student of a oil sp@@ ades , which had been til@@ ted to his interest .
I was prisoner .
free after Method Man , &quot; I was it if the absolute truth is , forget everything else I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only ampli@@ fied my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived ever , whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people .
I even had a very sh@@ utter love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the gu@@ ardi@@ ans and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most exceptional aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me like it goes with its Eng@@ acy .
in his opinion , he never holds behind the mountain , how to say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he considers , as a former colleague it express , and explained his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and Women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and agreed to him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes , which he won in the republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever since .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans to support this big@@ s@@ man , I asked myself ?
I was able to bring Tr@@ ump and his voters I could not know with people who had learned during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alistic program , people from all over the world , took a deep breath that I had talked about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps did not agree with the editor of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance is also standing in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gling with Sandy B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gled with the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son .
it still fits them to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , which always helped me with a lot of patience and wor@@ m@@ wood and my colleagues helped us to get to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew L@@ eck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot with my career .
those people and those caused by them em@@ bra@@ ise my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump sum up his way to the nominal republi@@ can presidential candidate , they bring to me a stop and counter@@ part in his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the strug@@ gles with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either part@@ ed his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , caused me almost the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
to defend the people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is su@@ perf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ fully and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the h@@ ec@@ tic changes are not taken into account in their congregations .
could it be that these voters voted , of which the most white are tuned for Tr@@ ump because they would like to win control over a country you have dis@@ appointed ?
in other words , they might say that they are important in this America ?
perhaps maybe .
however , you can hardly mention the words by David Rem@@ n@@ ick , who doesn &apos;t hesitate to raise a man with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look down differently than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( m. ) . : as much as &quot; Re@@ jection of White against all other Eth@@ ni@@ as , &quot; word game made of white in action at the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means the great Van Jones called exactly what America did so great .
millions people around the world estimate the American Ideal - whether the myth or reality , it &apos;s nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you can always have , America is welcomed every welcome .
for this country chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he says , no@@ where else would be possible in the world .
however , with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge part of the white Americas this promise and said : to Hell with versat@@ ility , religious freedom and all the term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 the white man again on Ru@@ der , they say .
at all I think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
in a demonstration of Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a space in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the amount con@@ found the amount .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos become a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were loud .
&quot; would anyone know , who is not so as you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a vote and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan ended with the words : &quot; God be than@@ ked , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t it your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was con@@ ferred .
the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , told the news .
and all the people , like Mr. Khan , could not find no more space in this new America .
and this is my heart .

from the el@@ end to the stars : these Latin American children do not leave their love for music .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero commune in the province of Oax@@ aca , with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ a@@ ean town of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
the music that is played at both places is not only changed the life of children , but also have a very close connection with ...
music , who lives with the drop
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 Kilometers south of Oax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists , but rather far from the nearby pre@@ col@@ onic ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for a few years now La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musi@@ ban@@ de ) in the village : one from children and an adult , symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found one way to over@@ coming the surrounding of them with their musical instruments .
a musical school with 100 students became a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in Oax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for its use of drugs and the ban@@ ker force .
but this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth has made such a rare hop@@ el@@ ight of hope .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very serious , the local press not@@ ici@@ as Oax@@ aca , N@@ VI :
once they come from the school they run back home and immediately after lunch , they run through du@@ sty roads to follow their great passion .
they always come up and play with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ j@@ bel for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from litter
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically up on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital city - on instruments which are made of recovered waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments produced from local firm waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling was begun under F@@ avi@@ o Chávez to turn parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , trumpets , tromb@@ ones , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all of which have been produced from rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , of Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez reminds of a local Ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura at the initial time :
first it was very difficult because we had no space for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where parents worked no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : a violin made out of waste .
today there is a whole orchestra which play on instrument made of recycled material and calls for the recycled Orchestra .
a documentation of the &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical performance to :
each year , the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish .
those who live with him and live are the p@@ oo@@ rest - like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something nice .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ing scene from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight the illegal fishing industry

this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that has targeted solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of content .
in West Africa , this ship was already known that this ship had already been operating in the Malt@@ ese fishermen , before reaching the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were raised accordingly , and had a little bit inclined to welcome a criminal cr@@ ush@@ ers to their coasts on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ized the ship . they refused to sei@@ ze one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing settlement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it wasn &apos;t possible to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative to cross the criminal practices and resources protects , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal f@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal f@@ isheries stop ) .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that then had driven out the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , director of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so because it is extremely difficult to use , so illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which specific hab@@ itats and species , can harm the illegal fishing systems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing was once exter@@ min@@ ded by bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , these actions will happen in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries may exchange with each other for example , to susp@@ ect lists , news to di@@ gest activities or details , which you have noticed during a harbour spec@@ kl@@ ist .
fish @-@ i persecuted the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive if they move on open sea through satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships which fishing in forbidden areas . even so di@@ gest ro@@ vi@@ ro@@ s can be discovered , such that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations show if the participating ships took a fish license , where they were on the way , and possibly even if they have a stra@@ y .
countries that are against illeg@@ itim@@ ate fish , on the basis of this information , the assum@@ ption of such ships may not be able to sell their cargo . and that they could not be forced to be forced by pen@@ alties , as in the case of Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this is what we want to reach , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm which supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win some 20 million USD in lost sales , which lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to the Il@@ legal fishermen who penet@@ rating East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish species , in@@ corrup@@ ted the region of commercial fish from all over the world . under these also Il@@ legal fishermen .
to their practices , these actions are such as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , speci@@ fying of imag@@ inations , fish protected species and fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a different country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this alloy hat@@ ch tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
until now the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved with more than 30 trials .
it has uncovered criminal networks , found counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it to escape and flee ships .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations show us rather far into the networks of organized crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to be more precise ships with more precise ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be further developed , helping to open the Il@@ legal Shi@@ ps to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very ingen@@ ious techniques to conce@@ al their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , principal analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO that also deals with f@@ isheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships turn for example their automatic identification systems , where they can &apos;t be read more by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find a discri@@ min@@ ating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team in African nations can actually take effect on the und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch platform together with Google and the sea protection organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be rendered to each of the individual tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; to be gathered with the neigh@@ bors to get a better picture of them , who does that - that makes sense to make sense , &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to join themselves and to make their resources to investigate .
we should do this on a global level . &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run with which a global system pursu@@ es persecution of ships .
there is evidence that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only crime crime , but they also cri@@ es out .
ships which are f@@ ished in earlier without license and hardly to reck@@ oned with consequences , now know that it ob@@ serves .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i currently accounts for a 33 % increase in fishing sales , then fishing boats for more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had assisted Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board drag networks which is forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries also note these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also have other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study project &quot; . &quot; in Western Africa each year marks disappear several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing .
there will be six countries closed in 2015 , so called West Africa Task Force . also they fight the illegal fishing , after exactly the same model as F@@ ISH . &quot; &quot; With security , the goal is to allow even more such initiatives and structures to be settled in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest members could be back to his first big triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . and not only the ship was travelling on the road and were not allowed to use towing nets .
the ship was also included in forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of action against Gre@@ ko 1 they made a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing catch , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collab@@ orative work has actually works in the whole world . Emma Br@@ yce is freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes on the topic of the environment , technology and nutrition .
their article will be published in the Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to split : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of conqu@@ ering the country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the official release of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra Mor@@ a shows a close recording of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela has rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on the official position , the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ians re@@ acted , in whose eyes negotiations ran on the political and economic crisis of the country , in which they gathered in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) can be found both images from these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the land@@ land@@ side of Bar@@ inas , in the regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ part@@ a .
the political and economic situation in the country has deterior@@ ated steadily , in the everyday life of Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ an through an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the official position of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance on a fundamental change ; ultimately , however , the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the Con@@ text of Governance in the following way :
within the context of social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate of the world &apos;s economy ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % at the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far lack of food and medicine is the only way to give the country to claim its institutional structures and close a new government alliance .

the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

the first demonstration in the context of the Action Programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 .
the images of the mart@@ ens , which are published in real time , testify among others an overwhelming participation in people in numerous fields of the country , but also disp@@ utes with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ acy of the government .
one of the most frequently divided images shows a demonstr@@ ators who calls through the protective shield : &quot; will you kill me , because I hunger ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot; he cri@@ es out of the Ven@@ et@@ ians .

in Twitter many images that talk about disp@@ utes , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
the news of the police in the central city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay was particularly large waves .
there , the demonstr@@ ators moved to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the government before the police and armed advoc@@ acy of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including those woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira carry no coats because you could see something , what many national@@ ists do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic about the round is already making the dimension of op@@ pression per day :
thus the dictatorship has op@@ pressed the land .
many representatives of the government had the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial procedure in question - this was now proven in the eyes of many in@@ numer@@ able people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs adds :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ed .
this is your official release !
on the road !
more than another step in the fight against a government who made a little step in the fight against the devastating economic crisis and therefore prefer@@ able to stop critical Vo@@ ices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasingly taking part in frequency and intensity .

as an adult man , Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the Great La Per@@ la Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were crimes committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting at the office , the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he retained the family secret .
in the situation then I thought that it was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years , it is not noticed that you are manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a thief , fol@@ ly and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ e@@ officials . during the Argentine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of State terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the service division 141 in the La Per@@ la prison .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano .
archi@@ ving recording .
this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressed , who is charged with ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ anos son , a man who knew the extent of the atro@@ cities in the course of the years that he had experienced as a boy , and who spoke before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows that great power has a parent with his child , and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to bring me up to the military base , I often went to the Sports Hall . there I had friends with a boy who made mar@@ tial sport .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father from him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo , and ur@@ ged me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you have rounded up with one of the ERP .
pass only that they will not run you one day and I have to save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation of the ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito revolutions del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the Sports Hall . a few days later he took me with work on the military base .
he said to me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and I thought in the situation that would be fine . for thus my father had gone up .
at the military base I had to destroy paper , which had heard the det@@ ain@@ ees .
these were all possible documents : University conclu@@ des , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ aganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ da@@ unting the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he was waiting for me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he commanded me to get off . he led me to a Bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - simply all possible - stood .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a little into a blan@@ ket , and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a large cl@@ ums@@ y of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ rack , where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I moved in and saw a Lie@@ ge which tor@@ tured on humans .
it looked like a field of dirt and metal springs .
later I found out that it was attached to the one end of a cable . the other end was fixed by the body of the person who had just left there .
they eng@@ ed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ fill it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ it@@ alia .
photo : Com@@ is@@ i@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the st@@ ank there was horri@@ ble there ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
years later , when my father got under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I knew the smell immediately and was clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forget that smell .
and I asked me : how is it possible that man can do so much with a man ?
&apos;@@ i knew I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me in work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the det@@ ain@@ ees were filled with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carried the eyel@@ ids .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , one of the civilians who was also indicted in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were moved with face down , all of them at their hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people stood still on the matt@@ resses .
when my father knew that I saw at the det@@ ain@@ ees , he said , &quot; What gu@@ do you do so , Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot;
I met , Why did you otherwise brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and was buried by soldiers and was buried .
I know this because my father was told at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed there .
( according to survi@@ vor@@ s of the Civil Defence Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was charged in La Per@@ la Ribera &apos;s trial , the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina was sentenced to death ) .
following the following Video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the leader of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path , which you come in here , is the way where they came here .
if you look on the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were given a number assigned to the process of de@@ composition .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of above came that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War spo@@ ils &apos;
my Father brought all the possible stolen things by home .
back then in the age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they knew it - was .
but when I was later on the military , - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I became clear that the spo@@ ils of the bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military combat zones that one has fought against a enemy .

but if you enter into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothing , painting , money ... as a result , this is no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I always asked how my father , the leader of security forces , could follow in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into an house and steal everything .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a crime and I said , And you , whom you go on the road ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded before anger , and struck me , and cried , saying ,
if you go so far , I will find you and bring yourself a stand .
we need any one another !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of at that time I had a jacket and a wheelchair of wool . both my father made from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing home .
then , the defence accused me of being a co @-@ lit@@ eral in this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay with me what they wanted .
I was anyway there to speak .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ h@@ or act &apos; act &apos;
now , where I am older , I am Reu@@ ter .
I have children . if one has only children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life .
one develops further and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you are ex@@ cer@@ ated during the dictatorship of the dictatorship , but why the dead bodies will disappear ?
why children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl with her home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost as a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I asked myself again the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they would have been able to put them into prison .
I guess , it was just decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people do not have families who were able to pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ h@@ or act that one can do a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ instit@@ uted , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners .
they were cr@@ ushed and somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains of course .
&apos;@@ I have seen how people killed people ! &apos;
just to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was with the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought , my father , was originated during a conversation when he stood under house arrest .
I made him prefer@@ ring because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience him because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt inside , and asked me what the whole Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ended , were really good .
then I cried :
how can you say something to me ?
I have seen how people killed people !
you have committed awesome crime , and you have forced me as a child to participate .
he only said &quot; No then show me . &quot;
I did exactly that .
in 2010 , I paid the first ad .
I finally knew that he was a crimin@@ als .
no one can submit to me that I was pre@@ occupied with me . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest warrant before the end of the trial .
he was accused of 416 pun@@ c@@ eries , including serious , illegal imprisonment in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 especially severe cases , torture and subsequent death in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a child under 10 years old .

the sentences in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish order of the judgment .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ribera process ended in August 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 op@@ pressed crimes against humanity were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the Court rejected life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases of st@@ icky pen@@ alties ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , they were acqu@@ itt@@ al .
eleven of the originally 54 accused were died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gment : murder , torture and rape through minist@@ erial ons . # Es@@ War@@ State terrorism
all the accused were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police nationals .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the Austrian Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations which have been working for many years in justice for victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argentine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , became the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the process took more than three years , but research lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ian government transferred the country to La Per@@ la where there was a memorial to be managed by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; awesome drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , which allows to extend his guide .
the photo was spread in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers from a newly opened center in which one can extend his guide , in the last month some witnesses of a completely mis@@ used translation .
the Japanese word ( B@@ rei@@ fen@@ sh@@ a ) , the &quot; older motor@@ ists &apos; , means that &quot; older drivers &quot; means , maybe - perhaps too bad back@@ grounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; aw@@ ful car drivers &quot; translated .
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance and building itself .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into the social media .
the mistake had fallen to the translator Julian Holmes , a inhabit@@ ant Ky@@ ot@@ os , was it too , who made aware of the local newspapers .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n , which is published in the Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
this is an understanding of the elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes &quot;
the def@@ ective English translation was first removed . the name &quot; Operation &quot; ( German : &quot; fe@@ ar@@ able motor@@ ists &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if the gramm@@ atical model was not correct &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture of Kyoto was approved for the translation errors . furthermore it declared that the error had already been contained in the text , and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News set up somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; awesome &quot; older drivers in Japan apart and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was denied as an appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents are involved , but the reason for concern .
in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the Sen@@ iors sent 1.8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this meant its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period has risen in the same period .
the nam@@ o @-@ mentioned repor@@ ter brought in the printed version of the article comments to the light which show the pre @-@ parts some Japanese apparently sp@@ aw@@ ed against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo over the translation error was given the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fe@@ ar@@ able motor@@ ists &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; If a faul@@ ty isn &apos;t the translation actually at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are no such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is widespread all over Asia
translation error is widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true mine of these bizar@@ re errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation defects are mani@@ fold .
for consider@@ ations one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter also requires active behavior of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers . generally , trans@@ itions that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the language language .
thus , a French mother tongue should translate from the French to English as an example from the French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
a lot of Japanese companies employ no staff with English as native language learning translations . this may be due to lack understanding , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese .
some enterprises , who have no foreign employees , have translations made propri@@ etary internally . then , the Japanese people who are considered best to be the best in English - regardless how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the advert@@ ised and en@@ ig@@ matic phr@@ ases which can be created by mach@@ ined translations , show that this technique is still not able to replace human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages .
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , among them also the en@@ ig@@ matic ab@@ bey , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for sty@@ li@@ zed reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry nor acceptable , or at least harm@@ less . but by major companies or from the government to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto uses as hop@@ efully a serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cen@@ sored Meas@@ ures on the Internet and Television
the main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to PRE@@ N@@ SA y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , in the Venezuel@@ an Internet users , they did not have access to Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online .
later , other users wrote that the web sites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV will not be available anymore .
other online stations handed over to the protests by the protests in Caracas , where Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro was contra@@ di@@ cted by the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
the protests began early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and the Parliament &apos;s duties entrusted to the executive of the Parliament and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was chew@@ ed , and receive users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access Internet .
# Zen@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that the web pages of ven@@ ez@@ oli@@ thic providers are again blocked again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of distur@@ bed .
traditional media are hes@@ it@@ ated since 2014 in the coverage of Prot@@ ests . at that time , the Commission threatened to report on money with fin@@ es and closure , when the Commission sees this as &quot; calling for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national TV channels I have registered for @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of so@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO stat@@ sin@@ cer@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) is un@@ accessible , but also two further online stations . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers their sessions .
earlier re@@ resear@@ ching of the institute for press and society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , we surrender that the local Internet providers can be used to browse through the DNS server en@@ quiries for certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS server , the server is faul@@ ty or denied the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ bet@@ rot@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third separate channel , the broadcast was set up on Thursday , April 6th , when V@@ PI@@ TV channel cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who had been recorded live in Caracas .
Flo@@ res was defeated , while he was nurs@@ ed in custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regulated the Internet connections : thus the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ians consume access to multi@@ media coverage over the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls are getting to slave to become an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visited the house where she worked for years .
today Tina for the rights of children and g@@ athers witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who became the victims of mis@@ use and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by Kur@@ dish , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as &quot; Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ es cows , acc@@ ru@@ ed schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America and will be re @-@ published .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not living together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her studies of studies at the University , she returned to the house once again , as the owner of the house of pro@@ ud@@ ly talking about them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
the coming from which something has become , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she started working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , in Paraguay , more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a big family with little money has its under@@ age son or her under@@ aged daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
but what does not mention , is that the children have to pay attention to countless days , that can never be paid and abuse of abuse and abuse - and all that cannot be raised within the framework of a contract which cannot be raised .
this practice is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing her studies Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that f@@ ights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls who are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected cou@@ pon , calcul@@ ates and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name the things in name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated for cri@@ ad@@ itas guarantees in general silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is also the family who are their daughter in believ@@ ing , that they conclu@@ de their training in society , improve their position in society and to &quot; something from itself &quot; can go to another family . &quot;
on the other hand the family stands that the girl takes up and whose exploitation with faith is justified that there would be any chance that there would be no formation , and maybe even an hung@@ ered .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will learn about many years later .
sometimes they never experienced it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which had been carried out in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , had a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered into the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , their bodies showed sharp hits . shortly afterwards , she died .
she was 14 years old .
it was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military personnel of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer in the office of the population .
Mar@@ ín lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with just 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
by the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira died with a stick on Mar@@ ín , until it suffered some dead@@ ly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they faced concrete that the murdered child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela fled the deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest installations and demanded that there will be no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the Girl &apos;s name and photographs were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; compl@@ ains Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without pap@@ ers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which terms of boys and girls are living .
the N@@ eigh@@ bours and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded an additional examination of the case .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had their Cri@@ ad@@ ita to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before a court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go will come from court .
the everyday life of a cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas will not only explo@@ ited as working forces , they live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik she worked in her father , she was forced to op@@ t her father and lost her father .
her brothers now had to go all work and began to sell on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital of As@@ unci@@ on as Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
in their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
yet they had to share the time that you still stayed time to learn .
they stand up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
on Fridays for example , they cleansed the refrigerator , clean the living room , polished the furniture and the infected floor .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn .
the rather they were done with learning , the more leisure had her .
but this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she had to be hungry , but got no unlimited food . &quot; I could get more books from the house of the house@@ holder as food from the fridge , &quot; remin@@ is@@ cent of them .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the budget , a former military and sympath@@ izers , the liberal party Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings of the House@@ hold Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and editorial staff from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
thereby he tried to convince them to give the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
he held them for intelligent , but did not refra@@ in with her . &quot; the house@@ keeper had someone found trying to listen while he spoke about politics . &quot; she says .
&quot; they often allowed me to visit my family , because she was the opinion that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of gu@@ ar@@ í , would speak at home again her mother tongue Guar@@ ani .
their Lord feared that they had the education that they had enabled to lose , again declares them .
however , her was completely clear that she had paid for everything they had paid for their hard work .
also in school there was Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a dis@@ discri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; a thing that is almost never spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to school if they go to school .
because the other children are parents , they immediately acknow@@ ledge that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I was no longer able to me home . I had no free circle at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friends arise , I perc@@ eive that I did not belong to any group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the company cheap the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group in which you can share St@@ ellen@@ istic and chil@@ dr@@ ens in Paraguay .
the administration in the group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a town council in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn to learn .
please report to you .
beginning from Monday , if possible .
you got five &quot; li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village of Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had been an el@@ f@@ ancy girl and gave their phone number .
another woman who also came out from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
in the third comment , a girl from the state interior that wants to work . &quot;
then the authors of the display was turned out at once :
dear friends , I have one found . I look like if it works with her .
thank you , I am writing again when something is .
the business was complete .
in Pro@@ log@@ ue to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of testimonies , former cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we made it , systems like slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) and the nati@@ ves of Paraguay ( which had to be viewed as hal@@ o slaves ) and the nati@@ ves of them to just@@ ify themselves , that many girls and boys were preparing themselves into a system of slavery , where they become light victims of mis@@ use and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the look of power are the key to the understanding of the phenom@@ ena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legisl@@ bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register in the government

sixty Egyptian parliamentary parties recently agreed on a bill to &quot; regul@@ ate the regulations regarding the use and of social networking . &quot;
if he is accepted by the Parliament , women and users of social media must be registered with government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , then there would be a place to provide civil citizens and citizens to share social media .
within six months with acceptance of the law , useful users and users can record their own names and number of staff numbers to use social networks .
if you want to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ or Application , defined by the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video content and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced , since the draft provides not having regard to the principle of data , as Egyptian authorities should not comply with the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and a password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks fac@@ ebook . &quot;
that could mean that Egypt plans to raise a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of those he would be necessary for Egyptian inside and Egyptians , information on their identity to access the network .
but it has not yet been known that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are sk@@ ep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the court .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly advise you to the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they are violent on the physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I call them seriously , this means that they will submit a strong surveillance system to request a citizen or not . and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a judicial process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt all is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first discuss the legislative procedure and the Constitutional Court before it de@@ buted in the plenary session .
whether his acceptance and en@@ roll@@ ment will be successful or not , the design &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different Nar@@ ration is present on the picture surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y ordered a bill of law against Cy@@ ber @-@ crimin@@ ality in which a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence was intended for those who are found guilty to thre@@ aten &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish natur@@ alist protects the Persian Leop@@ ards in the war of Iraq

this contribution of To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ b@@ old has been published in the original to En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . the contribution is published here as a part of an agreement to the Content Sh@@ aring .
high in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in nor@@ theastern Iraq , the animal protective H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq have to protect the spiritual Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , those of Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and freight surrounding their hab@@ itat , as they always find less prey to end@@ anger .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video , &quot; the Persian is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , &quot; and the health and th@@ ri@@ ve of the ecos@@ ystem depends on it that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards actually in the free game is low and goes around zero . as the team in the video is that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera , breaks out R@@ aza in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ olog@@ in , R@@ aza is passionate about any side of their country , which is not just a war and conflict .
for six years she has been involved in field studies with wild animals and educational programmes of Nature Iraq .
since 2013 , she has been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and puts it to be a protected area for wildlife in the Kurdistan region .

in early March 2017 , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o , the progress made during the last six years , had been achieved in order to re@@ building the life of those affected by the &quot; Three @-@ fold disaster &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake that triggered a ts@@ un@@ ami and an Atom@@ ic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture were a common pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate , forced evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappear all coastal towns of the map .
in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had an atomic accident , some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o shows that progress achieved six years after the local point of view to re@@ build the local local city .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re @-@ regulatory authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves .
the accommodation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare houses ( Am@@ bal@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei Ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the largest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas in Fu@@ kus@@ hima still forms the final light .
the same time is still hard , even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ qu@@ ah ( that , Cau@@ et@@ su Y@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to settle in final replacement homes .
after the three @-@ fold cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced into residence .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people still lived in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such places .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency accommodations , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i lived even more successful . more than 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ation laid down by the des@@ aster were transferred in the final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , this figure is 34 percent .
the status of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors to December 2016 , resulting in nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of fishing ports operate in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , only 30 percent of fishing ports have been resum@@ ed in operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident oc@@ cured in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land in a great neighborhood .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of his agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that only a result of the atomic fact is , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed ar@@ able ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism recovered well again , but also Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains well .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back up to 90 per cent on the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima still can have only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o @-@ Newspaper reports that since the cat@@ astrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it feels more difficult to earn their hab@@ itat .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a complete picture , the newspaper resulted in numerous un@@ question@@ ings under the native population and among the evacu@@ ation by . they asked them concerning the state of recovery , and even as their indig@@ nation against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk has changed .
in the introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o @-@ Newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o introduced a survey through to bring out more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents have still not been done enough in terms of cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ es .
as it is about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o @-@ Newspaper has raised its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated regions of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
in Fu@@ kus@@ hima never had to experience the tremendous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima had also been witness of the worst , disaster @-@ induced , atomic fact that had ever experienced ever .
out of 160 000 evacu@@ ated regions of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
in early 2016 , there were over 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 stand , still 40 000 inhabitants live in Fu@@ kus@@ hima out of their hom@@ eland pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas of disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ated areas are they must be consumed older than 50 years old . they must compete with massive building projects , because the efforts have to compete for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . here it is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &apos; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences may seem to be greater than the simil@@ ar@@ ities of the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
after a while , it often recogni@@ zes that one more often sh@@ ines than it seems to appear at the first glance .
these global connections are important because they challenge our advantages , expand our perspectives and remember that the world is ultimately very small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices po@@ d@@ cast , we look exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that received less attention than they earn .
we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which she felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Camar@@ asa is remin@@ is@@ cent of how the love for music became a lack of common language skills ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time when they worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activity in artificial coma , after being joined by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz . publication with approval .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week in the intensive care unit : last Friday a police officer had defeated a strike at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest against savings .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who is studying social sciences at the Federal university of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
doctors undergo him on this Saturday and now put him into a artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo@@ journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
the pictures is also known to recogn@@ ise the face of the police officers , which was identified with a squ@@ ash . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the Military Police proclaimed the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the investigation of the investigation of the active service .
the pictures show the police officer , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would be a police officer used by demonstr@@ ators and landing on the Inten@@ sive Care Unit , would be on display for six months and the entire op@@ pression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ er@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , a press channel from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , recorded by Lu@@ iz da Luz , recorded video on the grid , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and several san@@ itation shortly afterwards to him .
another video showing the same scenes , but from a different perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks .
in the bottom shown clip one can see the attack on Mat@@ eus off the 50th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family , which lives in another state of America , Internet users have donated 10,000 Bras@@ ili@@ an Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to remain in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is located in the hospital .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political power : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me supported Irish von his father , because he was a occupied school of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group , and now we have attacked the very sad residence of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen who defeated him with a impact on the face .
police custody
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to demonstr@@ ators in force on Friday the last Friday .
police officers lived in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for re@@ ins , rubber clo@@ cks and lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as .
the Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police via speaker announ@@ cements on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
it also includes a report in fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media street protests ligh@@ tens the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a distor@@ ted gl@@ aze window to design them with a picture of the front@@ sides .
to prevent the O Glob@@ o , the O Glob@@ o is a title story with a built @-@ in @-@ fire bus .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic basis , more about a broken window placement than the protests of thousands of people who serve in the defense of a special thing .
this is necessary to recogn@@ ise if one is mut@@ ed against any form of damage .
here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an ab@@ sur@@ d , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning and the typical violent acts of the military police will be mixed with the title &quot; protest@@ ers &quot; on con@@ front@@ ation course with the police . &quot;
the Ab@@ in@@ du@@ ck Ob@@ tain@@ ed villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso closed almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the Gregorian Con@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I , who is in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - , regardless of that there is no n@@ enn@@ ant sug@@ ars on site .
it is two years ago when the activity in the sugar cane mills were l@@ aded .
after expl@@ oring the sugar cane industry in the region was silent , and the factory lost after and after its facilities until the rum@@ ours of steel and concrete remained .
some 272 people had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes the work .
other auto@@ graph@@ ed and comm@@ utes daily to the factories which still grin@@ d .
N@@ ene , a solo &quot; veter@@ an , who stand up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar tube industry did not stop its sleep .
he heard that in the eastern part of the sugar cane factories , there are back into operation after long in@@ active days , because they have been preserved .
that was something that he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members to have heard that Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would get the sugar cane factory , but that promise was not kept .
sugar cane industry has already been drop@@ ping to the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the I@@ ne@@ ff@@ ness , the poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for a few decades ago for the country , but the poor v@@ ests are no more modern .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane ?
the old railway line of the village already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they were un@@ acceptable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories to produce the sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar pipes and the sug@@ ck@@ ering crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased before about one decade ago .
between 2017 and 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report on &quot; land economic spec@@ ulative &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar cane would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there began the process of restructuring in the sugar industry .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
it happened in the sugar cane Factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as a soldier , is known about the closure of the factory , is the word that he is repe@@ ating most often , &quot; Sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all those question@@ ings are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
in order to preserve the place , they were a full time - working group .
the first letters began to come back before the first shooting year .
this was officially recognised by the fact that only concerning the parts that would be removed , the address and the date differ@@ ed .
all were signed by Ul@@ f Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the ministers could appro@@ ve any claim .
and from there the responsibility was over and the letters were increasingly frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years , and it was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money , &quot; as@@ sures us . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another system , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the commissioning of the factory , where it helped the construction of their construction .
with each part which he took away , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the most advanced industrial sector developed by Cuba and the most important workplace was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases no alternatives for labour and services , which were generated into the par@@ ishes , were created , in which they were created .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth talk of 21 October 2002 , the then President in the eyes of those present people saw that he had not been in operation for the areas whose factories had not been running well for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding since 2004 .

after two years , the parish church Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I learned that many things are changing , but not always the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar tube factory closed , or better , when they began to move them , they also heard about to asph@@ alted street , this also pen@@ sions other companies .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories had to look forward .
they were spare to spare parts .
without a perspective , many young people left the region at once .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not used once for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working .
Ne@@ in@@ und@@ forty yields the old soldiers a pension of two thousand pes@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I .

first Nations Youth Un@@ ut@@ ili@@ ze Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express their own culture

the young people of the First Nations communities in Canada have been dealing with topics that are important for them . they &apos;re dealing with Hi@@ p @-@ Hop thanks to a series of touring workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an Tour bring workshop information directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live streams .
the original workshops were conducted by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop Group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop indicates that the young particip@@ ates in our convers@@ ations topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , con@@ front@@ ation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever their sense does .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked together with other First Nations communities in British Columbia , and was invited to organ@@ ise a similar workshop with the trunk of the win@@ es@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Y@@ oo in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ eu@@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; on which nearly two dozen women have disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mainly un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ k@@ hi Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate how important the obtain@@ ing traditional S@@ itten and customs of war in spite of influences by glob@@ alization .
many of the songs were published in indigenous languages , although the young people do not have to rule the languages of the first Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ ao Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the refra@@ in is sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people took some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop Group , who gave them a st@@ anza in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the St@@ anz@@ he stands at your disposal , as well as a translation into English , which is translated here :
sometimes I feel that no one would be interested in me
but I try to go on with my days on earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry .
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will lift us one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
they can grow up and prec@@ urs@@ or by our youth
so they can do that , for which she has ordained the Creator

in Japan you can see almost any restaurant plastic dishes .
in order to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu you will be found close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin of san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of any food that is served in this restaurant .
customers can see this plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of plastic bags .
there are a variety of these small businesses in the to@@ ki@@ oter section K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ IM Wen@@ ders has documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
most Japanese are these plastic dishes as usually that they did not take them once more . a new trend is now transformed into con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
in N@@ aver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger M@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos to show this unusual tw@@ ist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin rever@@ b .
now in special sale : new with plastic gr@@ ated cell@@ ed mobile tapes as they are displayed in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of this artificial foods have been changed to kit@@ ten collection properties , as in this case , refriger@@ ated mag@@ nets :
here are a few sho@@ cking refriger@@ ated mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essenti@@ als is increasingly w@@ ron@@ g@@ able .
in this case , an imperi@@ al @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile support .
for these tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile support .
this part we also have produced for the Tokyo Exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an Apple , who keeps your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing pl@@ ough into the Com@@ ic .
some mobile support and mobile designer allow you to manufacture your own work . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon was used , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doub@@ ts :
is there someone who would say : &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will be one of the only One .
this interest in plastic gr@@ ated can take also a less appet@@ ite form to surprise young colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile support is the form of mel@@ mel@@ et ice .
Moreover , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and wr@@ inkl@@ es from dried salmon .
you can view other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # 24 @-@ 24 .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the loc@@ alization of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin of san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against that organized crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against the drug dealers . &quot;

in reports in@@ - and foreign media about the inf@@ am@@ ous &quot; fight against drug trading &quot; in Mexico the mis@@ ses and mo@@ cks are regularly distributed in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cartridge , pushed the stories of the victims of conflict entirely in the background .
on the day after a violent case , someone does not look at the g@@ rief or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every glue , behind every bone remains in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds can never be healing .
therefore , the Mexican Intelligence portal animal pol@@ í@@ tico is the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; dealing with drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , &quot; ) is telling a voice and stories from people who fought in the struggle between the prosec@@ ut@@ en@@ forcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
voluntary crimes can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are a lot of pro@@ found .
for example , if shops close , because they are threatened with drugs and all the congregations will therefore have to drive a lot of kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear lives , &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who se@@ eks secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father , her father , her four sisters , her husband and two of her neph@@ ew .
Pri@@ ests : &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare for the task to let us go , let us go and go out to the graves after the people whom we have loved to search . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he was again back again , but he never came back . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , for I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you agree to the insurance of my father , but it does not get paid out because who demand a risk of death .
where are we going to get this ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not just show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts to show the frag@@ ility and the govern@@ ance .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some ex@@ cer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a Les@@ ker of animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central alm@@ ex@@ iko .
their contribution are remin@@ is@@ cent of the fact that violence should never be considered normal , no matter whether in which form it appears :
I have been aware of the disease and sens@@ ing journ@@ alism now since several years .
I come on newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with pictures , which actually can only come from a text@@ book for Cri@@ min@@ ology or from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only One who is mo@@ cked or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be valid for or this as normal .
you writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin seems that he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people will hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; when they go through the streets .
for me this is more than they would have lost to those who have lost someone and those who have fear them something like that .
I see our weakness when stories are to be blo@@ oming numbers in a statistics .
the en@@ nia of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified that they were &quot; abandoned . &quot;
I think they try to talk about that they are spar@@ ed out of such tragedy if they are not stir and still remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; four months Rev@@ olt in the city district : as a family with dr@@ en@@ ings has been sack@@ ed . it describes how armed crimin@@ als month had money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business but also her family apart .
you think of all that you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never goes , the g@@ rief remains , the fear comes back up again when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , telephone numbers also .
we only contact us if it &apos;s absolutely necessary .
the further we are away , the better .
she completed her report with words :
we want to be arrested that others are arrested , for one doesn &apos;t know when they will escape or kill you .
I asked me in these terrible days , if there were my deepest root feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to weep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of the fourth generation . &quot;
in the introduction , he pos@@ es asking questions like : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered in organized crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his old age , whose parents are taking care of them .
Br@@ yan is a f@@ ather@@ less and he tells that he had to kill himself , how to make an egg cook , potatoes , tortillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water , sugar and milk .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left B@@ one - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able to a boy for the whole life of violence , and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day after his childhood ended .
his childhood had been over two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody ri@@ che of his father , who was shot by armed men from a prec@@ urs@@ ing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organized crime and struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder according to the administration of civil security and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosecutor counted 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this is equivalent to 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that organised the organized crime in Mexico and enter the soul of the country .
only few stories live in view of the new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those who have not to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , called the Data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ c@@ data into life , whose goal is to depic@@ t the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trading , which has been tor@@ tured to the country in the past four decades .
when a picture is worth a true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the sides , to which it ow@@ e , contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it comes to raise a rum@@ or or to expos@@ e a f@@ ake .
but how is this year after something happened in the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ real , ten@@ ds to stand further .
take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it has been explo@@ ited to help such tragedy that have been held in Nigeria or Myanmar since its first release .
this false copy of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - denied not the fact that there are plenty more careful coverage of events in the DR Kongo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it casts questions about our desire to images on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ kers crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ed and explo@@ ded . 230 people were killed .
after the Civil War , Africa had been neg@@ le@@ cted for years , and devast@@ ated the streets of the region , the streets in the region were made of dangerous ac@@ claim that were difficult to travel .
it fell victim to the tan@@ kers to the victim .
government officials will described a fire@@ ball , dozens of dozens including houses that was full of people who &apos;ve been full of people who illustr@@ ate the soccer world championship .
houses tor@@ tured and sealed li@@ ds were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the un@@ mist@@ akes .
an image with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the previous day make the gray @-@ full scenes of that day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ized body that are sp@@ ers@@ ed on the floor while taking it .
but here it is not the end .
over the years the same photo was put out several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , so real was not so real , but not in the context of bearing st@@ ip@@ pers , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the kidn@@ apped Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
Aug@@ enz@@ eu@@ gen reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
but the numbers could not be confirmed but nobody remained to count to count to count , &quot; said a people on Human Rights Watch .
many were ra@@ ced , shot or burned .
only based on satellite images the follow @-@ up could be displayed .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ explained , but the army point of Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the army of Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am , land to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here shows the picture from the DR Kongo on , as a proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ used use of the image of the DR Congo is only one in a series of false bugs ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these inst@@ ances the image was placed as a letter for mass@@ acres .
another step further refine your personal comments such as this example , by the DR Kongo on the sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the image of S@@ ange came also in connection with the dead@@ ly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , published by the United Nations released their wounds , rape and some dead , some of which are burning .
while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya reported , post@@ gs appeared as the following that these descriptions were merged with photos from the DR Kongo :
this picture was taken by an aci@@ di @-@ Arab message , which was claimed in 2012 that President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ ein proclaimed , mon@@ ks and politicians were involved in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to photograph this information .
the original contribution , which was last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news bodies , the AF@@ P did as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed to His testimony , but had not taken the picture from the DR Kongo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false coupling jumps back to the years 2011 and 2012 and come from all over the world .
with a &quot; reverse photo search &quot; , you can see how far information can be exceeded .
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images in 344 at the search engine showing images from the DR Kongo on May 3 , 2017 .
they come from a mixture of private parties , platforms of social media and community and national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some false reports have passed , and others have tried to expos@@ e the for@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
we have examples of the abuse of abuse and associated with their respective countries , on which page they were published , so we want to represent the range of clear@@ er than the language alone .
several examples of mis@@ used use can be associated with each other ( in some cases ) .
here are some cases , which can now be felt completely dissolved ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples from false copy of the picture from DR Kongo on Nigeria or Myanmar .
local sites refer to pages or servers with examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or fal@@ cons are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information provided by Tin@@ Eye , probably also fal@@ cons examples .
as a memory , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Kongo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arab@@ s ) as part of a thread to &quot; War of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of a miss@@ ile use of the picture from the DR Congo , with one on the other hand , the sympath@@ y opposite the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other part of a blo@@ g@@ gers , the alleg@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , too gl@@ aze , because the photos were mis@@ used mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the government of Myanmar published a judge on what it stated as &quot; deliber@@ ately fing@@ ering News and Photos to establish international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding in relation to Myanmar . &quot;
this option has been published exclusively on English , also contains references to counter@@ f@@ eit images of rum@@ ours that are operated by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and from extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims Budd@@ hist@@ s kill and immig@@ rants ( which is often used by Bur@@ m@@ ese National@@ ists ) .

this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox church , is clear that the image of the DR Kongo does not show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar was cleared in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians had been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the p@@ liers .
the article was updated in 2014 and currently this release is included in the image .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now dissolved news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture was not taken by the k@@ ill@@ ings but it claims to have a &quot; similar d@@ Shi@@ ha@@ dist@@ ic attack . &quot;
as the picture was later , in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there was links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ d@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Kongo appeared with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag and dissolved a discussion within Muslims after the mass@@ acres of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the stop at Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities pro@@ claim these events that were in the name of the Is@@ l@@ ams , a bigger attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was wi@@ we@@ ed as a letter for the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times res@@ cu@@ des ) , but the messages that were associated with this were examined in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of the media reports in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message was allegedly written by an &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , it was placed in circulation like this here in Vietnamese and declared it to the fal@@ cons .
from the embassy in which the picture was contained from the DR Kongo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and Pad@@ re Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are further confirmed examples of a def@@ ective use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
based on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the folder in grey ) , inks are also not completely tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the web@@ cra@@ wler and conce@@ aled them about image file names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture finally carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( radi@@ ot@@ ation ) which post@@ pon@@ ed these post@@ s . the first frame focusing on religion .
the photo was used in respect to major discussions about the silence in the context of murder of Muslims , or the defense of Muslims - the encour@@ ages of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second bug@@ gy use the image to discuss how a African life is rated as opposed to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to investigate the images in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers cannot give this pictures longer than belief .
with social media , there are zig people who have un@@ intended to share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are true and decor@@ ates the real hor@@ ror of what actually occurred in the DR Kongo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images was already deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
a argument is that the rel@@ aying of pictures of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims itself .
at the same time , care is that for@@ ci@@ ble p@@ ics readers and viewers who take the ability to emp@@ ath@@ y Em@@ path@@ ia ( such as this study conducted , as for@@ ci@@ ble media to help others ) .
while there will be a lot of expectations regarding the media media , fact , fact that they are essential for the present news coverage are essential .
Techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they will thoroughly re@@ think about situation in which a painting is slightly sug@@ ars , which can be super@@ se@@ ded in context or completely mis@@ used manner .
each examination of false grants should also be taken into account how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uni@@ qu@@ eness of smaller languages

a blog with the name of in@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( such as D@@ ed@@ . ir@@ replac@@ eable ) ende@@ av@@ oured to offer voice insp@@ ections from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all .
such words are in each language : they press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these unnecessary words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous port@@ ug@@ uese acid ) and others that are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish s@@ brakes ) .
but all resist hard @-@ persistent every attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not sufficient , why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
this unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole time .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog one finds the words from the VAT of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ure yourself for your parents in recognition of how much for yourself in your younger years have lab@@ oured .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil as :

in Bir@@ ds his words from his blog About :
they cra@@ ck other cultures , un@@ veil other thoughts and wake our cur@@ i@@ osity .
sometimes you influence how we want to analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page still want to publish more of this &quot; un@@ ce@@ able &quot; words and show how differently , valuable and impressive these small languages .

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island nation of Sri Lanka has seen the worst flood disaster in this decade with the worst flood disaster .
that happens at the end of May , from Mon@@ sun , who normally set the rivers to the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to a statement of disaster relief of Sri Lanka , on May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missed due to the floods and sl@@ ud@@ ge membran@@ es .
more than 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people have been killed at 304 certain places .
the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water stands in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene items are a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos have an impression of the magn@@ itude of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter user like A@@ zz@@ am ants and Sri Lanka are regular updates for flood situation .
many use h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the cat@@ astrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s fatal floods wor@@ sens the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eds crisis , Save the Children after further rainfall are already on its way .
today , the Nel@@ th@@ wa Bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 metres . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a yesterday .
the Air Force has five planes for rescue operations and further five are completed for transport of emergency services for ship@@ ments in their floo@@ ded villages .
different organizations and start@@ ups have also been explained to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 disaster relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provides important information about flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams are using thre@@ ats for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and li@@ que@@ fied goods for flood victims -
we are now in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call us today the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 when animals need in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ uf @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app to be informed with the help of the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ an Center .
last year after the cat@@ astrophe of the Trop@@ him@@ u Ro@@ an@@ u , pic@@ nic Me a &quot; High Hydro@@ erh@@ ilfe &quot; button to give it a vehicle to pick up a vehicle to pick up advice and donations . these were then re@@ directed to the sr@@ il@@ an@@ ic Red Cross .
in addition , they led a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which had more than thousand in@@ quiries and 150 successful mer@@ information transactions carried out by floods .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , with which several social media platforms are fully exhau@@ sted , will deliver residents in need to provide safety and aff@@ ord @-@ action .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way up to the restoration of norm@@ ality .
Muslims who cannot see
the Women &apos;s March , 21st , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of the Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
use appro@@ x@@ .@@ Dam@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with one neigh@@ bor and one in love .
I trust you my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts to me : she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute , we call parking for the rights of women .
in the next scale we add rights to transaction .
we are located in a sea of Rain@@ bows and people , some keep the i@@ con@@ ical picture of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf , bound out of an American flag , other sk@@ et@@ ting slo@@ gan@@ s against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
my gir@@ l@@ friend look at me and says : &quot; these things do not affect you , or ? &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? , &quot; I wonder .
I have already taken this conversation .
people with whom I have been working or people who know me since years - the Sah@@ el that they know - from the well @-@ known concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in her idea .
you are mus@@ cl@@ ed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practic@@ ed our religion differently .
we agree to be a Muslim , on different types . but somehow we all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective presentation of such a way that as soon as I do not fit there , be mus@@ cl@@ ed .
to be mus@@ cl@@ ed
I do not stand alone .
this is even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures are in the sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old as I was now , he was a orthodo@@ x Muslim Pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran , and Prophet Muhammad , were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western introduction , religion was removed Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this cle@@ aring makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
another exists in the induc@@ tive images of Muslims , Western books had been colon@@ ised for centuries since centuries .
this loos@@ ening image language is determined by the dark man whom you should fear and the exotic woman that should be saved .
the pione@@ ering Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid broke out the story behind this pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures are still visible even today .
our polit@@ ician , the news and Hollywood , continues to store her .
I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for 10 years and I &apos;ve seen how to domin@@ ate this powerful , def@@ ective nar@@ rative our news@@ fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owing the reality that in the last three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential election .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v fail@@ es to recogn@@ ise that when French , Muslim women have to be prevented on public buildings , Muslim women with their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group ex@@ erts his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;
this powerful Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women to conduct the movements for change .
it looks like that the first Muslim prayers had been spoken on American soil by Afri@@ kan@@ ers who had been killed here with slave schi@@ p .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective bar@@ tering force deep and def@@ ective that frequently S@@ ik@@ h men and children are becoming an@@ tim@@ ely hard attacks and ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ings .
because of this stories we tell us and because of the kind , in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion people
in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative , who help us to understand the world .
and my industry is well failed to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion .
and we have failed to make seven million Muslims who make up the &quot; religious group in America during the highest degree . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the total Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immig@@ rants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live in order to live the American dream .
my mother laid her first jew@@ ellery design on 5th Avenue in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard into the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; Wol@@ k@@ sky@@ scra@@ per were made possible by the Muslim , American schol@@ ars from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan had re @-@ thought a new Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ab@@ dic@@ ated Muslims and Americans .
but now I got tired of Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
sometimes if people ask me why I don &apos;t ask a pork , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or to bring my hand@@ ful hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ oral , whom all Muslims carry in themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz &quot;
I kid@@ ding , we do not wear all of the pocket fans with us .
we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and religious activists , who ende@@ av@@ our to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced at the current volume of a well @-@ decorated Islamic portfolio of money , think tanks and experts for grooves which have already been a Muslim point of what is a Muslim ; or of what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell us and because of the kind , in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is more than just a stranger that breaks the head@@ sc@@ arf in more than just a strange woman .
or as the terri@@ fying card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .

Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in its most reliable forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
however , our identity mat@@ ures , which is so wide , versatile and more complex that they can fit in a drawer .
the author was in 1986 on a photo of their kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a but a Muslim force was born only when I was four years old when I was four years old in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they look back on the following terms : believ@@ ing , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
maybe I would see my gir@@ l@@ friend , my neighbour , my rock in the surf that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when they may look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that may separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ end@@ ental rit@@ ual with my daughter when I kept them in my arms and called the Arab verses to protect the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat three times each of them .
therefore I pray that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see , and that man may not see .
my mus@@ li@@ man faith is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always a part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an icon in Kar@@ achi , with their sisters sometime in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother is the matern@@ al part of my matern@@ al grand@@ mother , as they gain a competition of the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi ago for decades .
it &apos;s the picture of you that I slept in this moment , when I slept my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings of the old Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and an Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters which it can be almost completely war@@ dly .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to speak the prayers they told me when I had a bad day .
Mus@@ lim@@ a is there , as she has brought me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God is , my only Lord .
for a nation that was founded - over centuries - by a &quot; imperi@@ um &quot; colonial , which has established a company with the name of the British East ini@@ zo@@ di@@ - Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep significance to God to give my Lord my Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men do not weep , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rated grandfather weeping .
in the middle , while he writes books about the modern Islam and over the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan was overcome by his family in India , ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , their families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as the game risk .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the last two centuries of Europeans travelling all to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected in front of a century by a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an in@@ doc@@ tor@@ ship of the British Empire , called &quot; dangerous &quot; from the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; , because he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were aircraft , he travelled into more parts of the world as I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion people go deep into our unforgettable escape ; our un@@ inter@@ ned history .
it means to remember that fourteen years ago the most powerful military of the world , with troops , were spread over every continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , to pursue mass destruction of weapons that do not exist .
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
an American Muslim Brotherhood to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans have risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy this tragedy must visit the U.S. and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story contains four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad has been vers@@ kl@@ ed and brought into this land .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to name a American hero .
it is the warmth , which I feel , when people crow@@ ded to fight against the Muslim ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams , and if we say black life .
an American teacher , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a nut@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity of our with multiple binding ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate with others .
the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion is more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; they . &quot;
to be a mother to give me my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people build on this branch of structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is in the Muslim Brotherhood which began with President Bush and has been expanded under President Obama .
it consists in consistent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the in@@ mig@@ rating officials , which takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists of a country that surro@@ unds its limits against people from just the countries that it bom@@ bed .
it is a wrong and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ list , &quot; which matches largely Arab and Muslims .
there are the wars which we lead and the bombs we t@@ oss on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we can tell and because of those we do not tell us today .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University participants showed an experienced image and asked to assess groups on a scale of 1 through 100 as regards evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations that we must lead
we are to be dar@@ ing to know the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we have come back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and failure to store er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous expres@@ sions , which we store in our news operations .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple d@@ ash of ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast lake SO@@ ME@@ THING , Say SO@@ ME@@ THING by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the vir@@ al video series Secret Li@@ ves of women ; Sh@@ ares Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print appreci@@ ative Muslim authors and Ms mar@@ vel , the Pakistan , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope .

but I &apos;m wor@@ ried about this difficult global time point in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences , which go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that con@@ spi@@ racy theore@@ ti@@ cian , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now has the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ ential since they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has been exp@@ on@@ ential as it has created the &quot; other &quot; .
a few years earlier it had not been given them ; now they have great areas in Syria and Iraq .
I &apos;m wor@@ ried about the re@@ alities and the history , which I was not aware of , as I was so old , now my daughter is , but those who have made me today at an ir@@ cl@@ ums@@ y Mus@@ lim@@ a .
things I have left here as a bread master lane in my speech .
things you might want to wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ se@@ ctions that makes our human@@ kind , there is a story where someone is made to another &apos; .
just now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , con@@ vers@@ ations are held in the context of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; others &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms , with which we usually t@@ oss in our schools or read we in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I count this here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people through the work of the &quot; others &quot; in public screening , four decades appeared in the public screening .
we have to say un@@ comfortable questions according to the role of what , deliber@@ ately and aware of the &quot; others &quot; - such as my gir@@ l@@ friend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because he already bom@@ bed making us a new future , while he already bom@@ bed the crow@@ ds countries , and &quot; to others &quot; human beings , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for Er@@ counting Art wants to preserve urban diversity
history of history , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , under the use of B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way to occur here and now in spite of a language barrier to someone with someone ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ bil@@ n Perry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the creation of stories in their original language a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported short talk about an other initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ forgettable blog .
here , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written extent , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and off@@ ise the language variety of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite small languages are not given to the children born there .
the following applies to the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world may be avoided when we have cities to accept diversity - safe spaces in which residents do not forget to include them .
while &quot; listen often , &quot; we are often list@@ ened to understand &quot; these events instead &quot; to listen , feel to feel . &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ eller will first translate their story in their own language and translate or explain away in English .
even though the participants are not a professional source of history , their dev@@ ot@@ ion and their representation is that the audience list@@ ens to it .
they call laugh@@ ter and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the story of history is R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ate also the opportunity to explain to the country of typical customs of customs .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the cable of the h@@ asen and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he explains the importance of his pig@@ let , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand the language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ sen , he spl@@ its his feel of In@@ kl@@ usi@@ vity :
you have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
to date , the events of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling has taken place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can come into contact with T@@ LS to organize their own history of history .
Puerto Rico requests by the USA re @-@ fixing the state debt
with the aim of a new investigation of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars on April 3 , 2017 , several religious and civil organizations involved in a mass demonstration ; the march was started at the pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ak Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
the group was proclaimed by the group &apos;s &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the Neur@@ ath of debts ) and the Ö@@ en@@ ical Church Assembly Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ ession of the debt reduction of debts have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ur@@ ges that politicians , banks and government authorities that are responsible for debts to their corruption .
we call for a financial testing and a financial committee without personal interests to public debts , with a firm , our work conditions corresponding re@@ mun@@ eration , which ag@@ ates in favor of the economy .
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ os ref@@ uses to pay an gu@@ ilt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers do not get retired with sin@@ king pension payments .
we require instant measures .
the island - not in the State Rail@@ ways of the USA - suffer from a serious financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an anti @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on the soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the government infrastructure .
the measures imposed by the outside are threatened without participation and production of citizens from the people to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration brought the name &quot; Night@@ watch for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions here :

the Syrian Palestinian company Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing in a year since more than a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for its freedom and recall the contributions which he has made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , an scientist of the UK @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ qu@@ ay ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available here , contains a range of inserts that deal with free culture in the face of op@@ pression .
it is an homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction , it reads :
this book would like to be structured as movements for fre@@ ech@@ es knowledge and what are the real cost to which this is connected to them .
activists , artists , designers , designers , researchers , and authors involved in the movements for fre@@ eing knowledge have been working on page to create over the fog , which gives our news@@ fe@@ eds and create something from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free the Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about its present state or stay .
the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice which would need to know his release , and they want to know it back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how to pay a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us will begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , acts and decisions .
why are we now here ?
what did we decide ?
what have we been given in this process by extreme belie@@ fs ?
the web developer of open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody by Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from A@@ dra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military institution which was transferred to an unknown site .
his wife , author and lawyer in N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ que wrote on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; by the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 which had submitted themselves as an in@@ sider of the Assad government , having regard it by a alleged death sentence against her husband .
but his residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ ins played a decisive role in bringing access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently passed the head of the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which founded Bas@@ que , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps there was no one of the bass prototypes , as the work that he started with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , in order to virtually design the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important ar@@ che@@ ological sites in the world , was the way@@ point of many civil cases and here , the Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ ding traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ que could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything that is not just the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this stri@@ ving into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be for the public as well as researchers and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
in this project , Bas@@ ins could not close this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of their man to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom and bas@@ ins taught me to emb@@ race her .
I was overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English when he was already in jail .
I have learned English to read and speak English .
he always has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he taught others to read and speak English .
Bas@@ ins opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also brought others to the other , as they ut@@ ili@@ ze computers , at least theore@@ tically , without that they actually kept one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention .
bases and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for one year .
she sailed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab to English .

that I am in the world of your enchanting eyes ,

that every one of the d@@ angers is matter ,

I forget the pris@@ ons of the pris@@ ons
and I go in every detail of your voice and words .
whom I carry with passion for myself ,
when your eyes say goo@@ db@@ ye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return back to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get all the moments ,
and about your absence to weep and smile .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...

Moz@@ ambique : due to corruption , director of corruption returned to previous post
Mos@@ ambique responded to a corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus by the corruption of corruption .
it is part of Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 , together with four other accused of un@@ disp@@ at@@ ment of 54 million Met@@ ik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambique , their council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good management and immediately called his re@@ attitude into the company , which happened on April 19 , too .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , based on the application , there wouldn &apos;t be an obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , when the company moved no discipline procedures after its detention .
but many of the inhabitants are not good .
the Centre for Public Integ@@ rating ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , an local institution that focuses on public transparency , sentenced to a short interview with the Deutsche Welle , the decision to start the director .
represents a return in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fy the absence of transparency and even a return with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP .
what we should know that the company should have to take a discipline of discipline against the resistance levels .
however , the company was silent , however , no appropriate legal steps for applying the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ ence social media , re@@ jects this behaviour also and viewed the case as &quot; contra@@ ctions &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a consultant , after he was sentenced to prison in prison , and half of them had to eat .
he could pay lectures and motiv@@ ating words , he could advise and polishing his image .
but when he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to get re@@ integrated into the company who helped to stop damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is glad@@ ly paid for his silence .
resist@@ ible !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young mos@@ aic and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no Mor@@ al :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded from the State because he could not believe him , I can &apos;t believe someone with such a way that has already ins@@ ul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the murder and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but himself only served on the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was the state used as a hand@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself is tired of this man tired , that was pre@@ loaded and finally condemned to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man der@@ art was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to recall the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief has been in prison :
th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ i Mach@@ el the Moz@@ ambique is not only remembered as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , trimm@@ ing and - by means - proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous represent@@ ations was , when he was energet@@ ically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was able to sell , also the country &apos;s country for its amb@@ itions , to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ i also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not turn away from its amb@@ itions .
an ambitious human being is also criminal . &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also ref@@ uted :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and passed free .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users .
the Bur@@ m@@ ish word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or age @-@ aged .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social network went their net from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
even though the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ jective &quot; In@@ do . &quot;
Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical National ist@@ ical movements has given the word an extremely low @-@ saving movement .
in particular , it is a word that is usually used for Ultra national@@ ists as an article against Muslims who are a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to tackle the speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of sen@@ sible contents on its platform .
today , Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ mag is usually associated with rac@@ ism , but the word in itself does not call automatically hate them .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; lots of people reported that postcard , in which they discussed the use of the word , or doub@@ ts for the use of his manual , have been cen@@ sored .
furthermore there are several bur@@ ial words with basic different mean@@ ings that have the same sequence of letters such as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written by Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( age bracket ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( curtain ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ thing A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends was now deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends on spiritual kind , if they could not know how to alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain , having made an voc@@ al game .
the movement K@@ U la - &quot; Cure &quot; ( K@@ U ) + The Fra@@ ge@@ word ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the ra@@ cial expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win is the opinion that it will reduce the speech of radical national@@ ists , but emphas@@ ized also that Facebook should be analytical to spread out all post@@ s that occurred in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism .
Facebook is del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you are writing on Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should make , is carefully to analyze the post and check it by checking the un@@ ev@@ olu@@ ble words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( age bracket ) .
the good is that this dre@@ ad@@ ful national@@ ists who hate Hass@@ le has received a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their National@@ ism .
while the promotion gives a strong signal to all , the Hass@@ le may distribute the efficiency of this strategy is not long enough .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship is often just starting with Kat@@ z@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will just start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook began to delete his post@@ ure , when he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I atten@@ tively seeing this new Directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
Iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook with me , as well as parts and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post is &quot; the &quot; Facebook &quot; standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posters removed from people who have no negative inten@@ tions or simply trying to show their opinions against hate speech .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without Hass@@ speech by Facebook .
in the post , the author divided his opinion about why extreme national@@ ism and religious foundations in the country are po@@ or@@ ly po@@ or@@ ly .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have to do more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community should ask advice :
Facebook may have a sav@@ our@@ ing intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma thanks to its platform , but it does not work .
such words can be heard only more hat@@ red in the different communities .
it appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; peas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; peas . &quot;
even when they found out they did not make mist@@ akes , they did not temp@@ ting the missing post@@ age .
if they had only some more respect for the 15 million people who have a great turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ eb@@ ooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has provided lots of fun among users .
rather than to take it , users are talking about fac@@ ebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ language to see if their post@@ age are taken from the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook post , which no hate contained , but nevertheless removed :
with permission was used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ish Text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch the peas and take a Indian film .
just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screenshot , used with approval .
the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;
screenshot , used with approval .
over the past five years , extreme national@@ istic ide@@ ologies and religious foundations , which have used social networks , increased to expand their voices and their impact .
among other things , hate social networks can also heat the violence in Myanmar in addition to the territory of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands of escape .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure , who critic@@ ised hate speech to his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but rather than simply read the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have had better current to look forward to part in the context of concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is concluded with the child before
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child before is illeg@@ ally illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country unanim@@ ously decided to unanim@@ ously approved the law that this practice is intended to provide an age @-@ capable age at 18 .
prior to this change of the marriage took some members of du@@ ist@@ ical and mus@@ li@@ ous religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious group of the country gathered , that the state could not be joined , since that the state should not be pen@@ ed , since that , not the maturity .
this happened un@@ ob@@ sc@@ ent that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contrac@@ tor of the UN child &apos;s rights entity , the minority groups , aged under 18 years . &quot;
the statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago to 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s Statistical Office confirmed that by 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , which ende@@ av@@ ed to abol@@ ish the laws to the children before , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . evi@@ d@@ ently , they helped bring this result .
nevertheless , it wasn &apos;t all smoothly .
a Hin@@ du @-@ leader , for example , had no concerns , to tell the criticism of the children &apos;s actions , they should be dam@@ ned even to worry about their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition argu@@ ed for st@@ resses in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometimes came in doubt whether the opposition was to be fulfilled at all .
but early in 2017 the bill was decided against the child before - despite 4 trans@@ formers ( including one woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained in the House of Represent@@ atives , where there was a simple majority to do it to the law .
now just the President of the country must vote and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s trans@@ formers have released a status update which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill against the child before was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes in favour and nobody survived .
after having been decided in the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were excited because the laws had been changed before finally .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a minist@@ ery minister in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has always used too much time and unnecessary odo@@ urs , which has devoured the core of the cause , but do you know what ? the child before is in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now illeg@@ ally , and this is almost any value .
while Abel Jackson was not enough , it was definitely enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was very happy that the day was finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excellent News !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil group that spoke quite openly about how important the passage of the law is noted , noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is to be independent of religious affili@@ ations 18 years .
the draft for changing the event was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members , and 35 of them were present in the voting .
all M@@ EP@@ s who were toward the law have agreed for the law .
the children &apos;s before is not permitted by law in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fighting ( ... ) # child@@ bearing child@@ bearing .
many thanks to all the activists who finished him .
congratulations .
one thank you to our M@@ EP@@ s .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du Organisation of the country .
before the months Mah@@ ar@@ aj has announced his intention to bring judicial steps , the law should be approved , and it seems to be redeemed its promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Al ra@@ wi , a tra@@ vers@@ ing of the law , thought that Mah@@ ar@@ aj would just@@ ly anticip@@ ate the law , most social media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l smote :
dear Sat , if we agree instead of the discussion in general , in a way that we would need to say the state in our bedroom , &quot; simply systematically talking about it that they may be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ ch@@ urch@@ s men who are needed to be mis@@ used , &quot; would you be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that there is no problem ?
but if it comes to an accus@@ ation against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s actions are legally legal or remains the norm , although there are laws that they teach .

with mir@@ r@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia article published in English on January 18 , 2012 , in which the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA Copyright Act was presented internationally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month , Turkey closed the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is more significant as important as the platform for users to find out helpful information and to share reliable information .
both students as well as repor@@ ter and fans of TV series are we@@ dge against the blocking .
although many techniques are used to use power tools for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , the most ordinary Wikipedia are not in this category .
although Turkey has been forced articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been taking place regularly since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most illustri@@ ous country in the world when it goes around the solid c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are several mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages which reflect the content of Wikipedia and often be updated ) .
a solution developed by IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( e.g. calcul@@ ator machine connections ) , which does not support the system of domain names and makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is also available despite the illegal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS report about his efforts :
after having heard the news ( concerning the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set all of it to continue snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users help at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also existed that this step was performed independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it only negoti@@ ated with screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , the Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent lock .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sol@@ i by Wik@@ im@@ edia , Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ .org , an open source of Wikipedia , as also with Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can ut@@ ili@@ ze on similar Mir@@ ror@@ pages when in respective country Wikipedia is locked .

it is no complete copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror .
one ri@@ p@@ ens to another URL , which is not the original . that &apos;s what you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server guides the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia , when they are blocked in Turkey .

a Ne@@ pal@@ ian Wild@@ ch@@ ogra@@ f uses his camera to set attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ perf@@ icial r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros , Ch@@ it@@ wan .

with permission used .
S@@ late Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around around , never satisfied . they were missing with po@@ or@@ ly positioned moti@@ fs and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ated to bear a camera in itself and try to try the situation .
at that time he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ essions , Nep@@ al@@ ese labour to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown directly beside the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos the attention on Nep@@ als wildlife .
he described on Facebook as it helps him to do this first @-@ class situation at his work :
I live on the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it give it better for a passionate game of wildlife ! !
I just rested from home when suddenly appeared in Navar@@ aj ( the managers of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ rah@@ a .
immediately I checked with my camera and it was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was found and I immediately started to kne@@ e pictures ! !
S@@ essions aims to obtain worldwide recognition with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious , as they look like .
and he ought to know , because he stood already on face to face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t be dis@@ rup@@ ted from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
even I was there because of darkness in the way home when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ eb@@ le appeared . he is immediately going , we look at and he is star@@ red through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ is placed the &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and they usually lived in a tent to do at Bar@@ dia National Park recordings . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist information .
see below some of these photos below .

for the first time , Indian women voted for the first time to arrange the names of their hus@@ bands

this entry was posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of an Content @-@ Sh@@ aring Convention .
in many parts of India there are women with the greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands , or even from older men in the family .
instead , use a p@@ onom@@ ic or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ es@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband , as well as the fear of the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should preserve the norm in practice .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by a court convicted and killed by her family and of the village community , after she had talked about a secret company with names .
the tradition of their wives are not known in names , is also common in men . however , they have far been afraid to worry , if at all , they should not occur in practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health staff , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club in and were thus quickly became the main check theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , to discuss the delic@@ acy of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate &apos;s patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs , who are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ bad@@ al , who is operated by the community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and set itself for the degra@@ dation of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working with the help of their video camera for seven years with the help of their video camera to re@@ discovery of HI@@ L@@ - and AIDS infected , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
they reports about how this club created a secure place for these women and made them at the same time as ambass@@ ad@@ ors of mur@@ als .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round , did not call her hus@@ bands on behalf of their hus@@ bands .
it has decided for this subject , because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem to identify the women .
according to the names of their hus@@ bands , there is a bridge that they must comply with all &quot; obligations and never question@@ ed . &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition confirms that a wife resp@@ ects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t keep it , is considered to be a post@@ erior woman without Mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made thought to this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband at his name , had never tried at home at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother in law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was finished .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him from now on his name .
in this self @-@ confidence in the luggage the Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after video projection the women tried to bring the discussion with a practice in gear .
Roh@@ ini prayed every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , off@@ ended , sad , lov@@ ingly and so on .
then asked them all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the names of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they desire , does that they not respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the names of her hus@@ bands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine was born out of the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra over the breaking of a century @-@ old tradition , in which married women should never be out of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so sh@@ y that they just occurred during the whole exercise just before moving , and another decided to leave the whole arm@@ ament of fru@@ stration against him and his family , by destro@@ ying it .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ let over , with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to work at home to name their hus@@ bands at home .
and they held their word .
in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas they put to the women in the head : his wife did not stop to tell his name .
another club member chose to do it during supper before the whole family .
when her mother in law for@@ ged her , she was afraid , and said that there was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less discre@@ d@@ ful and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini , as women have tried to stop other practices , such as the car@@ cin@@ oma of the car@@ cin@@ ber@@ red point on the fore@@ head , which indicates the adul@@ tery status :
why do women only show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the car@@ nal red point , if he would do it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard that it was too bear to bear him .
the other women have not completely stopped , but my that they are now in a better position for themselves to carry him not on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can discuss their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a trip at each discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to make sure that women could provide , &quot; who could hear , &quot; says she .
during the last months , she celebrated her own birth@@ days for the first time in her life . she d@@ anced and spoke about things that they had never made thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on this problems for so many years and yet I have been linked with some things , for example how our ident@@ ities are tied to our hus@@ bands , never so hon@@ est .
it feels great to say certain things to say no@@ isy , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we have talk about the concept of honor and related to clothing .
some women in the group have only carried about Sar@@ is in the group since their marriage .
for most of them is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ was @-@ Kur@@ t , a wide shirt of a tro@@ users , wear ; they have not tar@@ red .
after many dispute and discussion about the advantages of his own clothes area , the Mor@@ al associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , Mrs. Roh@@ ini her own pairs of Kur@@ t@@ as ( shirt ) in a discussion round , so the women could carry them .
next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can carry Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they can do it .
on the question of whether the first discussion has been changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini said that things are slowly coming to the roles :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tast@@ ed a couple of time but they stopped again to tell the name of her husband .
some , included me , make it still , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women have a time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their fore@@ head .
the women in discussion club realize that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like the barrel of more motion freedom or own clothes choice - at the end of a hard to navigate the river .
by making their own self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
as Roh@@ ini declared :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives us the confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman is in the club home and other people were talking about what we speak and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

Gl@@ ory men are deported and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the people that could be a strong member of the Moz@@ ambique goal of attacks .

a new system of dra@@ g@@ ages for the body , presumably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , presumably the police station of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province of Moz@@ ambique . the local government has now called a number of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of organs were taken .
two men were arrested and given them in the epis@@ de that the organs of Sh@@ am@@ anen was used in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is no local super@@ st@@ ition , that the head of a de@@ cent man &apos;s Gold contains gold or wealth , the police officer from Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on gl@@ itter@@ ing men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the aim of ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN Security Council to study a mission in the South African country in 2016 to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring country Tanzania , where the government of campaigns developed to fight these super@@ st@@ ition and advantages .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who have to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le males who travel to Moz@@ ambique are the goal of rit@@ ual attacks , the Mos@@ ambique police disp@@ at@@ ted according to the latest ex@@ positions of three smoo@@ ther men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation took place .
H@@ uss@@ ene Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and inhabitants of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane , south of Moz@@ ambique said that local police have already stated that :
PR@@ M believes that the ban@@ anas are involved in the death of the gl@@ itter@@ ing men .
the persecution and killing of gl@@ itter@@ ing individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ shr@@ bal@@ a , in the province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has given cultural moti@@ fs and is considered to exist by the traditional sw@@ ans , which also states the police in the Republic of Moz@@ ambique , according to which the victims had been in power , the wealth of wealth .
in the last days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha told Facebook the chron@@ icles of the blo@@ g@@ gers arms Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , which is clear that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Moz@@ ambique is opposing :
I would like to ask E@@ IN Moz@@ ambique , DAS S@@ ME , a country in which the teachers would like to offer sex against good notes , and others not viol@@ ate their lives or even their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os still k@@ h@@ or who aim to get a country in which to get to slow riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenom@@ ena , some of them had not allowed the opportunity for ma@@ inst@@ able humor .
Zen@@ it Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusi@@ astic Twitter user , twe@@ aked that both the Chief of the District of Mor@@ h@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Fly , as well as the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ ver Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both gl@@ are :
mos@@ aic authorities are very wor@@ ried about the ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation of smooth people .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which presumably began only recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o had drawn attention in the international community attention , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state end@@ anger@@ ment ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which took part in the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Department of Foreign Affairs in China referred Li@@ us Case as &quot; an internal issue &quot; and a spokes@@ person he told it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
nonetheless , China will continue to participate in the international community , Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ liche Li@@ u X@@ ia who allow you to leave a treatment abroad .
while some countries critic@@ ized the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely missing .
Hong Kong Free Press received some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Z@@ eid R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met in late June Chinese civil servants in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a speaker , however , refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad a treatment abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s meeting Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway became into Sto@@ cken , after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was given to Li@@ u , although the nor@@ we@@ gian government over@@ took that this would have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . in June Norway signed an agreement to take the salmon swe@@ eping into China , since the exports have been blocked since 2010 .
after the message was spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for an un@@ conditional release of the expression and invited Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo .
he was not able to accept his prize due to his imprisonment .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution on which China was promp@@ ted to free to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately following the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical attention where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as she ha@@ sted to the release on 30 June :
we are at the same time that China lifts all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they must meet and receive all visits , they wish they wish , and able to communicate free with the outside world .
USA
U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans knew him that he has the opportunity to treat foreign countries , in@@ sof@@ ar it is for him with his satisfaction . &quot;
a spokes@@ person for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P announced on June 27 , that the message sent the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the confirmation of the US embassy drew a true answer from China to himself , with the utter@@ ing of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to make itself a united and indisp@@ ens@@ able remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel sickness and access to medical care of his election , to which they have specified in the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have introduced a decision in the Congress to re@@ b@@ ade the Chinese government on it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditional .
I needed China to allow Nobel Prize @-@ winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ conditional , that he should give yourself into a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hop@@ ed that Li@@ u will get all the medical support that it needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o would be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing , the news agency Reuters , that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit in Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28 , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China asked for giving a reasonable medical care to them and give it the opportunity to ren@@ ounce his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P previously told that Li@@ us X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to talk to someone out , including its lawyers , to talk and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells about :
Canada calls for China to adopt its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to safegu@@ ard the rights of this rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry asked China for a declaration of humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o ob@@ tains all treatments which he , regardless where , are needed . furthermore , his wife and family may have contact with him .
in spite of the news service , France information reported that the French government would be called Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there would be no further information , whether France will end it .
Taiwan
the Council of the Com@@ mem@@ orative issues in Taiwan ur@@ ged China on June 27th to allow Li@@ u to allow for a major tolerance towards those who require peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u from the ruling party proposed China in China to allow the sick intellec@@ tu@@ als to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a statement on June 28 at Li@@ u very concerned and gave that many of him asked to pray for Li@@ us Well@@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and had been strictly pen@@ alised in which he had contributed to a harmon@@ ic , more stable and we@@ al@@ thy China which had contributed to a peaceful world .
I personally encourage me personally and also encour@@ ages when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter 08 signed , which is for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question might be sil@@ ly appearing since Singapore is recognised as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered to be a city in Singapore .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State Department of the State of New York , the minister , that many people critic@@ ized the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries .
he under@@ stands that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has asked if New York is a democracy ...
that is , whereby most people go an error .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no land .
the Blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to turn &quot; the logic &quot; to defend the existing auth@@ ori@@ ental exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and offered to create this valuable land , we hear that we would have no land .
it was so vul@@ gar that had a escape from before the responsibilities , a mandatory infr@@ in@@ gement .
Singapore , if you are not my land , whose land is it ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very Nobel : he def@@ ended up an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore not with other &apos; normal countries , in view of him , he appeared in@@ sof@@ tened .
by contrast , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as you reach the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re of authorized fe@@ asi@@ bility , they have to be Democrats , leaving the turn@@ able logic as they fit better to their power .
in the final week , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am was given answers to his American guests on our press , our representative , our political system truly non @-@ answers .
relevant issues tar@@ ry with non @-@ answers to rati@@ onal manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to illustr@@ ate his mind , since they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore has no country , but one city is , so to which country is owned by our city ...
short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grat@@ eful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would like to clari@@ fy this point , if it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog read his comment , referring to criticism that it should begin to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference , in order to understand the context of statements of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , according to which Singapore has a city and no land .
please read the tran@@ scription .
as he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore would be un@@ even easier , even if we are looking forward to ourselves and righteous elections .
he drove Singapore to cities in the United States ( and how many of those cities saw a party to win a party in decades ? ) .
as he said , Singapore &quot; was no land , &quot; it is obviously not in this sense !
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows its dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who as leader of a her@@ ent @-@ growing generation , such as pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said to do very much ...
at least I knew Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old yar@@ n , which I expected to agree with them or not , but that is a different thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubt and I &apos;m not sure if he really believes it is associated and aware of what he def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ covers the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams Arg@@ in@@ ers :
does Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; have committed a mistake on or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ ger Speaker ?
when Singapore has not been a country , we are only regarded as independent and sover@@ eign state ?
if not , on which country do the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role in the government &apos;s government , the statements of Mr Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious importance .
why do they aff@@ ord their military service to defend their military service , but do not defend their own country ?
who must pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink personal cloud ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
ten@@ ds the Journey Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the occurr@@ ence , Singapore is and always a city :
&quot; I haven &apos;t said what I said &quot; ...
this proposition seems to have many people &apos;s more expensive ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have been a city / island nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ used aspect of your home or home country ?
their responses will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is claimed to me in Japan is : &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; let &apos;s answer me . &quot; I come from Canada . I &apos;ve lived and back in Japan since 1994 .
depending on the situation in which situation the interview is taking place , there is a pol@@ ite to show interest in its talk partner by making personal questions .
in order to clari@@ fy the standard hin@@ ts : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature &quot; . many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook may be kept inside , if they are kept for Americans , but not bo@@ ther@@ ing me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is a little one distingu@@ ishes us by Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many can@@ ans get a Canadian flag easily visible on their back@@ pack if they are travelling .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans are the ... .
so it was even when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadian players have always carried small A@@ hor@@ n@@ als of their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
the same sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we are obviously very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is supposed to be considered the toler@@ ant country over ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate it .
first , I have many American friends who I ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would account for me if you would like to change Johnny from Dallas by car .

if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , that would be in fact a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nett &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which you can encounter .
harm@@ less , its in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and interesting to make any attention .
this may be something good if you want to keep un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things going around an around .
I would even go far as far as to say that the wish , free and alone to be a main entrance of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what kind of out@@ comes as &quot; nett , &quot; perhaps just just cool courtesy .
Canadian players do not talk about the fence across the neigh@@ bors .
we lack the warm @-@ heart@@ y , open kindness , which I &apos;ll connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice , &quot; our prime minister has made Canada only sexy .
musical video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert in Thailand Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous Pop band has released a music video that the j@@ unta par@@ odi@@ ert that in 2014 took power and despite their promises to restore civilian government , continues to gover@@ n the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his love his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not expressly polit@@ ically , the music video directly refers to the continued military dom@@ ination of the j@@ unta .
the band was blessed by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a giant @-@ success .
only in the first three days , the video was divided up on Facebook with 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video has been blocked with the dict@@ ator &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; into Thailand after a group of activists trained to view this video .
the video can interpre@@ t as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to Thai policies , in@@ consistent with the situation of the country under the j@@ unta rule .
look at once these photos of the video , referring to some of the political themes , the Thailand successful in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; refers to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which grants the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army &apos;s absolute decision on important national topics .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the creation of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons , who can be viewed by Jun@@ ta as a critic .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the Act on Computer Cri@@ min@@ ality , its v@@ age and un@@ clear provisions often used by the authorities to negoti@@ ate activists and other critics of the State .
for this purpose a new unit was established in the army , the online content is monitored and people who are accused of having prosec@@ uted the mon@@ archy .
Thailand uses a strict soci@@ alists against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic damage ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the mar@@ tial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup by the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase , their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts would war@@ n that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax returns .
in the video it will be shown even how people are thrown into a black delivery van before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are sitting in prison , because they allegedly infr@@ ing@@ ed &quot; confusion , &quot; in society and an internet users are threat@@ ening adher@@ ence to en@@ vi@@ ate the mon@@ archy .
the theme of the songs of the band , which had been cited by the Sal@@ ut from &quot; Die Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , who was previously used by coup &quot; during protests in 2014 .

the following article written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , first published on the Website of OC Media , published here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society recovered only very slowly in East Asia , especially in the T@@ c@@ arch@@ al district .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the bas@@ ins of Asia @-@ Asia .
various ethnic groups like Rus@@ sians , Greeks , am@@ as@@ ies , Geor@@ g@@ iers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Rus@@ sians and ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are called intellectual property in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people still lived , today there are only a few hundred people in these cl@@ ergy .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ c@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , 16,000 people were the total population of 16,000 people , which had hardly increased over a decade .
in 1989 , about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this area .

&quot; that is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ t@@ k@@ ow@@ kas are symbolic for the decline and destruction of the region .
the buildings are fallen and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met an amazing older man .
he begins a talk and it falls to him difficult to end this .
&quot; that is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why are you talking about ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all served by the community .
now there are only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and contribute to their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have already left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ chi , which can accommodate one or two families , one recognize the balconies where the laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look from the window of a destroyed house .
when you discover me with the camera in the hand , they move immediately .
&quot; our Mother told us that we can take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed somewhat with her gir@@ l@@ friend and suddenly they left the gut@@ ted building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable construction .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the District Management is provided free in charge of candles and bread on the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman moved to Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave before Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ as to live with her . &quot; my heart is happ@@ ily stay forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to assume no financial aid by her daughter and insi@@ sted that she supports their young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a sweet garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; is there too .
a@@ unt G@@ alya tells that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate their holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we can not always do this - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour will appear on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls to the a@@ unt G@@ alya her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cchini .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; one can get to all things &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a conversation partners in Nat@@ ascha together with her husband and five common children lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village of Dor@@ es before the war .
despite their relatives , who live in Central Russia , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia broke off ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave it .

the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house , where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was once more , they hold s@@ wine , cows , h@@ eh@@ ne and chick@@ ens .

&quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people .
one can get used to everything .
many people believe that this building were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has somewhat to do with pl@@ agues .
after the war there were hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day like the city and war once were . &quot;
when we were talking at the end , running a little boy to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
one ball flies from the window and another young ch@@ ase him .
he plays with the ball , who then under@@ lined the hill .
a group children pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them cast stones onto the hidden buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood which ensure infin@@ ity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

in Mexico , &quot; m@@ om Africa &quot; houses the immig@@ rants on their long voyage
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken released on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and is published here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants attemp@@ ting Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican female , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink gold frame and golden earrings in a t@@ ed@@ dy oval shape .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . however , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this sur@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) has become a destination for Afri@@ kaner and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the pass .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 Dollar per night , guests sleep in simple rooms with grinding , cr@@ um@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless there are hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is telling people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you m@@ om Africa ? . &quot;
currently it is more quiet but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cart@@ ons .
she desires to re@@ ject no one .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medicines that they can &apos;t pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in front of a short time .
I asked him if m@@ om Africa was an appropriate sur@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ i@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ gh@@ at@@ cher ) posed with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to move into Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits you because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
it has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister , the hopes to get to Boston where to get there her husband and three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ kaner who are on the way to the United States , normally a first stop in South America and then to move towards the north .
the family had heard from other riders accompanied by Mama Africa . &quot; m@@ om Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that , Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App of Mr@@ .@@ Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of its leader , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in previously lived and worked as a construction worker for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa since months : he sells SIM cards to save the required money to get the bus ticket to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
I ask him if he is in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; m@@ om Africa is our mother and we never leave it again , &quot; he answered for sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mr@@ .@@ Ram@@ í@@ rez told that her guests often send to text messages when they have gone to gre@@ et them or to give her about the course of their journey .
they explained that Christian faith is the drive of their work .
they do not know much about Africa , but their guests have taught me to prepare me as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps well known here but it is not the only radio hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the town , a s@@ ack@@ g@@ asse leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valencia and his family have recorded migrants in their little house .
it is polic@@ eman and has found that the Bust@@ ers are sold to a lot of African migran@@ t .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , and he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hot@@ spot outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border over the desert , and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was sent to a raid on his office from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to press money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an all @-@ known , it has offered its roof again .
a few months later the family still lives and she tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the ais@@ les they consul@@ ted quiet@@ ly their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is nost@@ al@@ gic even because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother they look in their album with many photos .
there are one of their daughter with African hair@@ spots that you made a client , some photos of their grand@@ children and lots of travelers more , kids and elderly .
they laugh@@ s sad , while she pre@@ ys me briefly .
&quot; Ya is fu@@ eron , &quot; repeat every time . &quot; you &apos;re already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phone .
check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang on Twitter Users . Mess@@ enger Shipping .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on 10 July , the cell users of the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District Apostle Ur@@ um@@ qi was granted a cell @-@ notification , in which they tried to install a surveillance app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning ) .
the notification is said that the app will allow access to terrorist information . &quot;
but k@@ os the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app shortly after they had exchanged the app to have a private We@@ Chat group .
in the press release of the police , the app would determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terror@@ ists and would follow , along with &quot; Il@@ legal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults who was introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic pages , from online fr@@ aud , Tro@@ ians and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend on online , and to control your own home network .
this App with filters for min@@ ors should help children help to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can be used in a variety of course .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers could manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal from it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China are mostly focused on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , m@@ illed ethnic minority interests such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ aking on the Internet .
based on Twitter based media Out@@ let &quot; images from &quot; China &quot; ( &quot; Export Express &quot; ) , published news in China , displayed photos by a Check@@ point , on which police officers were in@@ discri@@ min@@ ated immediately , whether they had installed the surveillance app .
authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification asked that people will install the app within 10 days .
if you have discovered an chec@@ kers with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a blow for the technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
that is a form of captivity by rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; China &quot; ( &quot; Export Express &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can raise a Windows operating system to allow un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
following the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones are in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang will possibly have a reaction to the follow @-@ up of the city council , to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content .
all government agencies , authorities , and the party linked institutions , including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the Cyber@@ security office during operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report by the Freedom House , an US @-@ American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang published the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a Regulation with the order to all residents and entrepren@@ eurs until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , not@@ eb@@ ooks , and media memory cards can be registered with local authorities .
the intention is to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; and destroy this promotion , however , the privacy rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possibilities , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or Death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after Death

far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ ar that you are very alone at a place in which all the Import@@ ant has disappeared .
everything revealed after and after dis@@ solves and a truth revealed that it is clearly visible , both from inside and outside .
one that makes her name all honor .
one , who are in a list of feelings and push down , that allow no met@@ aph@@ ers to allow .
but if you pick up the reality again - beyond the scenes , the beautiful scenes , the beautiful scenes and the per@@ formers - transform the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all the doub@@ ts are in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear that you are caught between the walls , your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough to make &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he gave his power over us , by making even the most simple concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn out of peaceful protests like dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to cut the city down the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ en .
all the neighborhood will cov@@ eted , but my own does not .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ im@@ ing , in the wrong time , even if I found no high demands on a city that resi@@ sted to the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their compli@@ ments .
in the third night , things had something cal@@ ms , after the power supply stopped in the quarter .
I broke silence when I cried several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice through silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends feel cour@@ age@@ ous enough to summar@@ ize .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends open to me ; we are al@@ lied with a wonderful picture that was my expectations full and fulfilled .
in such a moment you are aware that you delivered the spirit from the lamp , but it &apos;s not interested in your ur@@ gent .
I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can &apos;t stop , nothing can return to you , after you have heard your way up to the office of security service from the body .
I joined there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his males . my father was already there , just as I was now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me listen to me as you are &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only cour@@ age@@ ous enough to sh@@ out if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ ug@@ ly filled eyes were on me .
&quot; and you mourn for me to see me in the eyes , and not on the ground . &quot;
and what I did , nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
maybe it was on my foolishness , vanity ; maybe in the revolution .
I was so sure that I answered : &quot; I would not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never heard of seeing you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that such fat@@ alistic consequences for me could have , and yet regre@@ t I not a word from what I said .
&quot; he is in sol@@ itary and his father similar to it . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal with it . &quot;
the st@@ ank of this cursed is given to me until today in the nose .
he became one of the &quot; syndrome , &quot; an arbitr@@ ary torture which I was exposed for months .
I walk through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
later again by the yard and into the second office , which leads through one ais@@ le to the single cells .
I pre@@ ge me all details exactly before I supervised the room .
unlike otherwise , they have added me another cell in this time .
I have to share them with only one single prisoner , and may put me immediately , without waiting their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I handle it on an old proven communication method : to beat the f@@ ist against the wall .
I knew that my ancest@@ or f@@ in was a &quot; Er@@ sth@@ ain@@ ling . &quot;
after a long @-@ tax collectors he finally answered me .
apparently there was none of the surrounding cells , a well @-@ regarded medium @-@ age age that looks similar to me and &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness there is no significant expres@@ sions in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe som@@ ebody , whose voice like my sounds ? &quot;
all responses networks its existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located in one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had insured me that they would be free when I stayed .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would like to have a look of a bird to drive all these c@@ rows , who lab@@ elled on the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black and the colour of the painting , until I saw the yellow light , gave us the look at : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &apos; Donn@@ er , &quot; playing on 13th sc@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to hear . &quot;
that was the secret to protect the sover@@ eig@@ n@@ ty : in order to protect the sover@@ eign and terror@@ ists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wit@@ an dial@@ ect - thus they played their cont@@ est@@ ial re@@ comp@@ ress@@ ors and proved the narrow viewing field of their world view .
this is not a house , that is not a country ; it is a curse which they call co @-@ exist@@ ent to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound in a hero .

he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the fac@@ ial expres@@ sions , despite the fac@@ ial expres@@ sions , who are still young , you can do so much more important when you join this day and to protest against demonstrations , so that you will soon become an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer me , not to answer .
I can really not say more exactly when ins@@ om@@ als and stro@@ kes were made after a friendly interview for me to become an ordinary communication .
when and how that happened , was in@@ important .
some voice in me told me that I had to be punished or severely punished , though I had done nothing to earn this sentence .
on penalty in all of its diversity .
his command is to me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ately &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably originates from the hook .
your Hen@@ ker has caught up to your write .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him , and you can &apos;t keep your cry .
my scre@@ ams made him not enough , so that the pipe was divided by a cable .
when my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ators had worked for earlier times as a refuse working day or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables in each other to present ourselves from their visibility , great invention of a giant cab@@ bage .
three of them rarely changed from them during one hour while still in the row .
I had lost all my body in my body - and my voice , why I list@@ ened to sh@@ out .
the hen noted the cooling and found no pleasure in all , so he was the next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to feed my whole quarter .
my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor .
the dew disappeared and the pain was again there .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been that at midnight .
I decided to sleep to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that I was my only option .
a few hours went that came to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the room . &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
I am answering the voice of a exhau@@ sted young people : &quot; my lord , my father needs to worry about seriously . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and quiet you , you will be re@@ located . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
this photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b produces the majority of his time in the same time . he v@@ ats his screen down to his computer , and again to his couch .
but after you can leave , a cigarette can be discovered between his fingers or his mother by Nik@@ ot@@ in Im@@ mac@@ ulate lips .
he lives in the top of his family house which had been part of them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs were forced to escape from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) .
for more than six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is an passionate activ@@ ist who has transferred the conservative majority to the conservative majority of gender , sexu@@ ality and free expression by art and rap@@ port .
with his music , often associated with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry , he also calls even the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics do not only be rich in its home town Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that go to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders , and he may agree to the devastating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though it does not make it open , he wins a special dis@@ advantage against the US foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his co @-@ feeling for those who are trying to do in war zones , signi@@ fies what he was born with his identity as &quot; Palestinian poultry &quot; of the second generation - even if he was born in Jordan and never before Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own living things , &quot; emphas@@ ises H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think , &quot; I am a man , while in the waters of dissolved Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; this time it is intended for Muslims from sunrise until sun@@ down .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ adan .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sen@@ ring hot day would be little with protest against Islam .
basically the gap lu@@ cent coffee and the wa@@ its of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under free sk@@ ies , especially when you look into the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do with basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan water - to land not in prison .
recently , the Interior Minister Jord@@ i has had an appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some of the parliamentary parties that support the Islamic acts of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ dic@@ ts the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert tab@@ s is .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ woman of the islam@@ ic coalition called Dim@@ a Tah@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; had been cancelled because of sexual orientation of the S@@ ang@@ ers .
many claim also , the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , who auth@@ ori@@ ze the old proven legitim@@ acy regime in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a estimates the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , who continue to continue &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not simply s@@ ooth@@ ed rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic but actually clearly reflected out @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work clearly .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional Gender Equality within the body , formed in 2016 by taking his vision of the fate of Arab women who had vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a obviously unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women that have lost their lives by the hands of them that they actually trust .
in Jordan , the number of Hon@@ orary Men@@ de &apos; has increased - the in@@ official outside was dropped in Jordan .
human Rights Watch therefore reached its cli@@ max in 2016 . however , the number of honorary changes reached its peak ; however , Jordan was missing the institutional infrastructure to support women who tried victims of murder and domestic violence to ensure proper way .
according to a Law on Cri@@ me control from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence , &quot; must be imprisoned at in@@ certain time in prison , &quot; and for their release , often a year @-@ long bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort , as well as the guarantee provided by the family , that the woman will do nothing .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music is enjoyed great popularity and is well @-@ known for it , even did not seem to be so@@ aked in its country for long as tab@@ oo .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b f@@ ests that his work is polit@@ ically , however , that he is able to separate his music , full of exp@@ ir@@ ations of sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of opinion , not able to separate politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was tried in politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of the songs that are polit@@ ically active in the core .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song there is repeated one verse often :
&quot; you are free , and everybody else is it . &quot;
in the course of the songs H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get what you want , &quot; - be faith or non @-@ faith , h@@ etero@@ gen@@ us or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of vibr@@ ations and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an@@ ic On@@ line@@ work Program Ro@@ ya , to realize that his comments were torn out of the context , turned aside and cen@@ sored in his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded with cuts , but only a revised version , &quot; says he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is advert@@ ised for the Arabic L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the mind that Int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance did not dis@@ agree to the g@@ ay of homosexu@@ als .
he mentioned in Abu Nu@@ des , a po@@ ets of the eighth century , who still remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ des ought to work once again during the job of the Cali@@ ph , in the eighth century , why can Jordan not go ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled , to do .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic kingdom there is nothing new to dev@@ ote the government attacks on free expression and that progressive voices can be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian newspaper was accused of several former government officials and members of the Federation , with the grounds that critic@@ ises the problems related to social media dealing with the depth of a deep @-@ ro@@ uted corruption .
in view of its opinion , H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s concert is just the top of the Eis@@ berg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anian nation .
for him , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a has now been kick@@ ed for him for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ dings and internal changes . it is certain that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian Society will take place .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams like millions of other Arab@@ s also from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he dre@@ aming not only to bring his work up to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region is approaching with the help of music , art , and literature of a real and basic op@@ enn@@ ess , and not caused by bombs , stre@@ ches and artificial species . at least , he hopes this .
till it goes far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will keep going on and therefore resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war@@ ships are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories as regards the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is believed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of pon@@ ds , drums and dancing over a thousand years , and from a time origin@@ ate in the troops of the West Japan in the nor@@ theastern Japan to force the indigenous population of the region , the Em@@ ishi near the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to gra@@ b a few great seats , therefore we have a great view .
you can imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital city , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a double @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking for a long time again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two fixed cars are currently visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori the only thing to take to A@@ om@@ ori the only thing - and again a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and told me the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 metre high feast was incredible .

rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this history , because they are helping to alle@@ vi@@ ate Peru@@ vian youth from the Cri@@ me and a legitim@@ ate profession as of the Fr@@ iz@@ urs .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historical centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where tr@@ il@@ age and illegal drugs are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 demonstrated that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region are not safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance , and thus also the unusual hair@@ style of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Peru ) , has caused more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ y , which can meet these elabor@@ ate hair@@ style .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ style , which go to the extreme borders of fantasy , and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition &apos;s bar@@ gain &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there will experts join each other to show how to create them the ec@@ cent@@ ric le@@ es , as you can see in the following video ( further videos for current cont@@ ests is available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here a chance to experience their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and to get their weapons against hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work .
motiv@@ ated by this activity and looking for bi@@ et@@ izing possibilities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school was offered on special training workshops before the school year which began in March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only university school in the municipality and the district which we are very proud of , because of love with the children we have built this education community .
Colombia : love letter to gu@@ err@@ illa
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the revised version of the post @-@ article &quot; love messages in gu@@ err@@ illa , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel it out , aff@@ ection to opposite ?
just this question went to the two young colony of Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation ; inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters about reconciliation ) , who encouraged young people to write gu@@ err@@ illas &apos;s letters .
recently , her country was the venue of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after a long negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , who forms the slaughter point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was to mark the signing of the peace agreement as a significant role that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received for his services to the Nobel Peace Prize .
yet in front of the colum@@ n@@ ans , there is a long way until they can talk about real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who lived for many years in illeg@@ itim@@ ate camps , who were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and carried out their weapons around the clock , to integrate them again into the life of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society again who had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant distress and in some cases , they have to record their ranks and support them during the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian was convinced that the young Columbus had to join the integration process and help the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people wrote letters - love messages in former gu@@ ill@@ aries to welcome them again in the society .
the campaign &apos;s target are 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illas , who then to be handed in personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation emerged at the World Summit of Peace Prize , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Crist@@ ian said the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people whom we love to write out thousands of love letters , but those who need them need more need@@ ful .
he has failed to share his love with people this year , who needed the most ur@@ gent matter .
thus , the plan was to write letter full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make a dis@@ course of a war story to a common history of peace &quot; say they say .
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would be forgiven me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region at the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the General Administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ art in the camp to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC on how they had done before to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no commands , but letters full of sub@@ sid@@ y from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it is incredibly , how many different feelings one can run in just a few hours - from fear to Happ@@ iness and everything that lies between &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Govern@@ or of the Valle del Cau@@ ca Province , this memor@@ able experience is :
after having handed over the letters , a former fighters led me by the camp of the Guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ book &quot; ( a sort of refuge in which the gu@@ err@@ illa live ) saw , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illas who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because beside him on the bed a M@@ GL @-@ Granat@@ werfer designer , a dead@@ ly weapon in the village of Dor@@ n@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
ever never in my life , someone wrote something so nice , so do I respond to it . &quot; suddenly my tears were about the che@@ eks .
and I emb@@ race him , and set me beside the pom@@ egran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was sorry to be all the years of faithful fellow workers , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only possibility to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I would never thought that someone would forgive my mist@@ akes .
but now I know that there is a company without a society that wa@@ its with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to handle weapons .
but now where peace is prev@@ ailing , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
for the out@@ set , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC expl@@ aining the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years many years have experienced , as we have the opportunity to develop us to a political party , we can contribute to help us to tackle the society in that country .
it &apos;s worth a target to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed with :
these people have never heard their hearing , and had no elections to know , and to recognize that people who have often seen as a monster , and even hated even people with beautiful feelings , which were turned over by their lif@@ esp@@ an and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , wo@@ e to me .
but it comfort me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage caused us to bring us something , and a smile and a h@@ ug .
many former fighters have answered letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the Archbishop of Cal@@ i in the following letter :
the column was prophesied that it would reign after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation .
but this is not the case .
as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care , and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are ready to gra@@ ze to the weapons , and that is completely justified ( ... ) .
we are at peace with the F@@ ARC on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of the race , religion or ide@@ ology - to rise above all those that dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord our contribution and sacrifice , for we know from my own experience that nothing is simple . that among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be pending .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of an article based on our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ ova and the first published in the OC Media website .
hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of d@@ angers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and express .
with terr@@ ors have experienced the coverage of the last month about the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , like a dam@@ o@@ cl@@ ad about the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q municipality , is not built until the night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual wife from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us what is currently happening in the republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines before several months , after reports published reports , tor@@ turing , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Je@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , suspected que@@ er men , and they found it in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a religious woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt a woman since her childhood . she was a woman in reality .
when they were grown up , you knew that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was no safe place for them , why it went to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced by the sex children , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
she went out of fear for her life to the US .
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunte@@ er hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
this was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman , that was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he made a friend of mine documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can eliminate these dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made possible through all W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on October 10 , 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just going to bring a few shopping spots on the back seat of my cars , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt me .
then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you escape the family ? &quot;
I don &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up last du@@ des in the hospital .
apparently some women had taken away everything and started sh@@ out .
the man was fled .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
in hospital I learned that I had two queen in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which case fen@@ ders were laid up - in men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , since there is still my male name ; but the doctor stand and laid me in women .
I am very grat@@ eful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I was afraid to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim , an Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grat@@ eful to him that he resp@@ ectable with me .
I spent more than one month at the hospital .
I got thre@@ ats last February .
they cried to me , wrote me - relatives , strange , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of an alpine trau@@ ma .
my family was visited by neigh@@ bors and some away relatives .
the requested to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this is a lie .
they found ab@@ sur@@ d recei@@ v@@ ables : some said I must prove it without breaking up the streets ; others wanted I have changed in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad words , and Photoshop .
I have body size C - what should I say in TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some elderly people said at once my mother on the road .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole Republic . &quot;
we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she took a kn@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately the neighbours and res@@ cu@@ ed them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 dr@@ on plate .
after it happened for the third time , I was clear that there was a little la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ friends checked the number@@ ing - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I will not give her name , but I want to say that I remember it all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something un@@ belief .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought them without record without reference , without any dis@@ card .
I dismant@@ led my old SIM card and threw her into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked at the hotel .
number was registered to a fore@@ igner .
I plug@@ ged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe me , you would have forsaken me , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in which Hotel du st@@ ole . you know even your room number .
only to prove it you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this really was my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about the sex changes , this is a tobacco topic .
I have some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements still in me .
so very I want to be able to overcome this se@@ an barrier .
I say always that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
when we sp@@ it with camera , I would like to look on how the person wants to look like it out of their past - so on my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the present location in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed d@@ ord@@ as ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to som@@ ebody who has one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told , that during the Ram@@ adan there were no man arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all of Ram@@ adan were barely visible , and he did not enter a new wave .
most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives .
so I think they would probably download the relatives with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood gen@@ ius .
OC Media : will now g@@ ay be kept imprisoned men in these secret places ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there wouldn &apos;t be very many .
if , especially those who have no rich relations or have been dropped by their relatives in order to set up Kad@@ y@@ rows Court .
as far as I know , they will be arrested there , that they can present them later as terror@@ ists .
say : should they be brought , they will show their body on TV and claim that they had attacked any village or military base .
do you understand ?
as though these people were not simply gone , but have pl@@ under@@ ed specifically to radic@@ alize .
OC Media : is that only a failure or have a source of these information ?
Sab@@ rina : I have just been detained for someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their B@@ art grew .
there have been nothing new of them .
they simply have taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was also taken away when these people were taken .
up to now , however , they have not been presented as a band , yet there were no reports so far . we guess that such actions are possible .
why otherwise should it not be allowed to shave this people ?
do you know if this persec@@ utions and demonstrations of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already took place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve been wearing my hair always long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had problems .
Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much more secure than now .
in Russia , Russia wanted to lead us to &quot; civilian government , but ultimately cast us into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhau@@ sted and I had coloured eyelashes , bore the tube and short tops .
the Department of Safety of Sh@@ aria never has never been stuck to me only one hair .
ahead of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me arrived .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people arrived there .
we were never ins@@ ul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a realization : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ otto not on the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is said to say often to children , when it was funny about sick .
OC Media : so they just got their eyes hidden before you , because they believed that you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never have been off@@ ended , never ch@@ ased and never beaten .
OC Media : how long kept this grace period ?
Sab@@ rina : so long to Kad@@ y@@ row appeared on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about Mor@@ al .
he didn &apos;t talk about us , but pre@@ valent about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - it was possible to change how people began to catch in the city .
who had v@@ elled before and laugh@@ ed , consider yourself at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the meantime , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic steadily slow@@ ed down .
OC Media : what activity is going to do for ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA .
of which I still have been active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ating with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ff , together , I gi@@ ate them to hospital and help them to get familiar cards .
I have no less cents .
I have discovered this people yourself when I hal@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ lied .
so the nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ yan , who like to turn it with foam in front of the mouth that there are no vibr@@ ations with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have that the Kab@@ ard@@ iner have , who also have Rus@@ sians . they are on the planet it - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it is un@@ pleasant to hear what to hear .
I meet here as many men out of the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the Mos@@ que and during the Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
know how many think of tran@@ sid@@ ity towards men who love the men and they believe that man changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a tru@@ er .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be precise , different environment settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not fru@@ str@@ ate me for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m sorry so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now even longer than a year ago .
and I am not very sad at all - I know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of suicide in the United Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i community in Iran
Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffer from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there has been a strong increase of suicide .
the photo of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : using approval .
the self @-@ combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ o Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the bran@@ ched situation of the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which was marked by poverty and unemployment , the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered among Ang@@ st@@ ony , depression , and he rewarded himself for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to get the in@@ ability to his family , so Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i human rights groups working in Ah@@ ra@@ z work and anonymous .
one on YouTube video took the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people made it quick to delete the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the valley of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the valley of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide committed in August within the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i minority , and activists say that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ er@@ awi , S@@ ayed fal@@ ah Mou@@ ss@@ awi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - to be hung up this month .
their stories have a matter common : there were all family re@@ ties , who felt thanks to the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ capable of doing their families to feed their families and ensure safe work .
Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , located in which a large majority of which in Iran live Arabic Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i community , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis that makes it difficult to contest the native Arab population to contest their hab@@ itat .
in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ mon@@ archy took power and in 1925 great efforts to complete ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the A@@ wa@@ z Region there are some of the biggest in Iran &apos;s coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est and most valuable space for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population receives only little from that wealth .
it is often victim of untreated ill@@ nesses , hunger and kidn@@ apping .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s to systematically find jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are .
these gl@@ itters have only led them to destroy the devast@@ ation region in the region , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fishing and palm trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi young people now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , registered that 5 % of Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ is , who completed a work that completed elementary school , 55 % a further school completed and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... &quot; to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; the number of suicide among young Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i @-@ men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become more worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of native Eth@@ nic Persian and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the context of :
since officials and institutions are pre@@ fers to set Arabic workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to all sectors in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling reg@@ imes which destroy them to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s , and to conquer their hab@@ itat outside their native Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their advantages and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i , since even Arabic name may not be toler@@ ated , because the speaking of Arab language or ar@@ ches Arab clothing .
given the given circumstances which have to bear the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i , beat human rights activists , before the situation will be explosive .
it remains waiting , whether the world aw@@ akes and it is aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is in@@ treated depression .
depression is expected to be avoided and committed suicide .
they can receive assistance in secret emergency lines for self @-@ ord@@ end@@ anger@@ ed and people in emotional cris@@ es .
you are visiting Be@@ fri@@ ender@@ s.@@ org , in order to find the telephone number of suicide in your country .
&quot; why I do not identified with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity ?
detail of a photos . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
the following article is an updated version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , react many women - especially white women who design@@ ate themselves as an inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists : with fru@@ stration .
they are wonder@@ ing why I am not part of the movement .
they even had a well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be in general all the femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women today still earn less money despite the same formation as men .
that women are still standing under strict observation , when they are going to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards always ensure that women before or later in diverse areas of life to a glass blan@@ ket , and that discrimination is still across the many different countries and faith .
all of this is aware and known .
I am convinced of it and I suffer twice and triple them .
I am a black wife .
and yet , when I come to skin colour , rac@@ ism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q commune , or to black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention , on which kind of physical exercise , both in and outside of femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists have been silent .
but they are all agree that women - all women are coming together to take &quot; their voices em@@ por@@ ting and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence in addition to sexu@@ alized form r@@ assi@@ stic form of r@@ assi@@ stic violence , which we have exposed to black women two times .
or that , black women and women have less earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to school as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black don@@ ors and women were exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as the white women .
on one side , I want all the women , all the men and all men always have either skin colour the same rights ; on the other hand I can join me as a black woman , in which the white woman stands to consider their iniquities in their thinking that relate to both the gender as well as in the skin colour of a person .
I am exhau@@ sted and won &apos;t be strug@@ gling for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere , who always and countless other black women always and repeatedly rejected .
So@@ y@@ man compl@@ ained in her words in 1851 , &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refused me to just@@ ify a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human being a human being in@@ alien@@ ated and mar@@ g@@ inal beings .
I ref@@ using me to join me in group alloys who absorb our customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ o@@ centr@@ alized program .
I will not try to draw white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin colour and gender . because some of them will continue to decline the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach they better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was formed in order to give a home a home and feel of white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; is still in his name .
I prefer@@ re to release me full and completely from the femin@@ ism , and to join me the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman in life that is so persistent that Inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it &apos;s more important than ever that we will define black women to us according to our own ideas and give us into our offices , which are created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana ur@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves to our own art . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , body , physical and even the spiritual elements can be converted to the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately noticeable , after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contra@@ di@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic area I can increase black women and women of other cultures because I live in this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I am acknowledged from my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradise .
I , a black wife , can blo@@ om in an environment , in which my life neither survived , nor igno@@ red , nor is rejected .
Pad@@ del@@ ity against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article of To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ b@@ old was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , this review about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
this article will be published here as part of an Content @-@ Sh@@ aring agreement .
ever again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled over the past 7 years - usually with surf board or in can@@ oe - with a special approach by the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in His church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river which we had lost when I was a child , &quot; told Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of the war , the construction of dam@@ sel@@ ing , pollution , and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate hydrop@@ ower in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ ch@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - that is committed to protect the rivers , streams and water trails in Iraq , as well as local communities in sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;

Paraguay women and their more difficult fight against violence
a group women constitute &quot; The weeping Women , &quot; in order to express their pain over the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show their re@@ jection .

the following article is the shortened and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; from Kur@@ haus . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ au@@ au@@ bin ) , who reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protecting people concerned .
a police Commissioner A@@ da B@@ á@@ z said that she could not work against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their own partner , who became a non@@ violent venture against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena .
since the end of its relationship has been some time now and the police said that its statement would be put to the ac@@ claimed , but more could not do .
when another Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena was used for mist@@ re@@ at@@ oning , the ac@@ ten@@ ant display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ z is nothing .
a few days later , the second woman moved her ad .
violence against women is difficult to break the Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ re@@ is of violence against women .
if women occupy themselves at all time , they generally receive no support by the State of State .
in many cases , women also are fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men who need them hurt . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit to be victims of violence at all in the prosec@@ ut@@ en@@ forcement agencies .
holding 1 stro@@ kes and Statist@@ ik@@ en@@ 2 In@@ visible missions and a legal system that contains nothing under n@@ imm@@ t@@ 3 of Paraguay : good approach , def@@ icient implementation of stro@@ kes and statistics
it is difficult to real@@ ise how many women really mis@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports , but they did not even show the extent of the gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General Prosecutor of 9@@ 600 filed complaints for domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women .
86 % of the ads came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads in the peace dishes due to domestic violence . here , 86 % of the ads came here .
in the ads , 40 % of women told that they were physically hurt and 55 % of women have been suffering from psychological abuse .
these statistics show , however , not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ a@@ agu@@ an women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i are actually shown very few of these off@@ ences . &quot; on every woman who will be made in Paraguay for mental abuse , come 9 women who do not do this .
for every woman , that is refundable because of physical missions , two women , who do not do this , declared it at the end of 2014 .
because women &apos;s mur@@ ders in Paraguay cannot be adequ@@ ately documented , as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists were at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay all ten days a woman died due to violent men .

invisible mist@@ re@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was a firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all their former friends .
at the beginning , it didn &apos;t wanted to do that , but then , however , it should be for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos . but two years of age , they contributed the psych@@ ic violence against women and at the same time the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ z@@ able :
I would never thought that I would be a victim of abuse .
if I have read earlier on this , I thought that only women have to be subject to sub@@ du@@ ed , because they let themselves suffer from violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana took social media to tell about the abuse through Carlos Vera .
without name , they wrote on Facebook , in which they described his ins@@ ure and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had ins@@ ulated them .
many people answered them on their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ isch , whether he ever lifted up his hand against her and refused to make his behaviour also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t left him earlier .
it seemed almost like that , as they wanted to say that victims of abuse would have at least certain participation .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner she har@@ med her .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consist of women who are everyone in any way victims of abuse .
in the group they can speak with others over her experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case , everything began with psychological abuse .
her prosper@@ ous partner finally managed to convince her to convince her .
then he began to sm@@ ite them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as judges kept in the authorities without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a process against its former partners , who developed into a continuous legal struggle between Paraguay and its native country , in which it was mainly for money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good but not applied .
the ad of abuse is a path of resi@@ stances and a fight against corruption in the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also provides great problems with the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , the par@@ a@@ ay@@ ic Parliament was discussed under a bill that was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Für@@ i ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the Act stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ izi@@ d seems to explain and har@@ der the case as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legisl@@ ations was modified in some points , in order to win the M@@ EP@@ s for the Law that is believed that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions will be forbidden in principle and only be punished by up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill was intended to charge the most of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) process , which must end@@ ure the victims of violence even if they just want to ad@@ mit it and secure a safe accommodation to impos@@ e the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective when the legisl@@ ature is no sufficient financial funds for it :
in Paraguay , abuse was seen as part of human relations .
this must take place here , that violence is not considered a bit of nor@@ ms .
whoever tou@@ ches these figures in view of the facts alleged in him , he is responsible for the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
we must report such a long ad until mis@@ fortune is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Act was approved in the par@@ a@@ agu@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had changed , among others , a passage that had called the partners in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about changes are to be seen apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity to attack the ag@@ g@@ ressor , its victims again .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; made of parts of the law is considered a great blow .

al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned to the public order of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the State &quot; State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found out in addition to the violation of a public publication and the exp@@ ir@@ ation agent .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three year @-@ old adher@@ es and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 mil@@ an Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a year @-@ old occupation against the two journalists was sentenced .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after the use of &quot; an information network for dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could represent a risk for the public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ an@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was fixed and released on 22 August 2016 before the sentence of pro@@ clamation .
the Court of Appeal said Al @-@ Ab@@ ri on 26 December 2016 , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari on six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 to ban his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ cat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he is his first @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appeals Court also stopped the decision of the Ministry of Information , to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper looks like to be exposed to attacks by the Peru@@ vian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information sent an order to pro@@ long the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Information Office personally signed a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister introduced a further time against the decision of the Appeals Court , the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman at youngest time the press freedom was viol@@ ated .
for further injuries , for example , count the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country , its operations .
on the basis of the closing time of the Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ ic authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the om@@ ic authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ conditional ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can go out of their work ;
3. to protect the press freedom in the country and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights and journalists in Oman may impos@@ e their legitim@@ acy work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of verification measures , including the judicial proceedings , including the judicial proceedings .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ ite Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place using his identity
medical research in Africa is only rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is an growing area that is addressed to one of the ur@@ gent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need of medical research on site . there are two reasons to cover lots of medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria combined in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa more than elsewhere , and lack of investments in the research of these diseases are a big problem .
secon@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , continues to develop its own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ ite Warri@@ ors is director of the Centre for the research of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic first engraved on the national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later to Indiana .
as post@@ doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ching himself at the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to assist the sam@@ ic healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and beyond the media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. Warri@@ ors talks to private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ ite Warri@@ ors RW : the emphasis lies on my work on the application of research results . I also under@@ line the sam@@ ic national programme for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only rely on solutions that are differently developed .
that must change , otherwise we will always stay receiver , instead of the makers .
the solutions that we get , are often not suitable for use in our surroundings , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or come here , because the financing and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards of developed countries . it will cost a lot of money to have continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it lasts for months to import them from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should you concentrate on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
there is need for special scientific training , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and inf@@ ectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are greatly benef@@ itted .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life than scientists in Africa against Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed , things to do , and the most difficult access to scientific expertise that represent here challenges .
the system that magazines can only be accessible against payment ( so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited quantity of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , an magazine published on solutions for environmental problems .
Frank Mort@@ on has been cultivated along the United States since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 types of varieties , like the out@@ set , the first plant , which has been cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ aut in space and en@@ chan@@ ted .
after almost 20 years of work , Mort@@ on &apos;s work would only be put forward by his own ad@@ versaries , and the question of how many sor@@ ts of sor@@ ts can be set .
but in the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that it could not be used for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain qualities such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves .
over the past few years , more of such patents have been filed on more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ography . due to this trends , plant breeding , environ@@ ment@@ ers and experts have been providing food security for the future of food production .
however , as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on still needs a salad , but now it takes longer , since its work is still worth a greater extent .
&quot; it &apos;s like in a river a b@@ oul@@ ders , around whom I must emb@@ race .
so we must do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think these patents have to go to sal@@ ads .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new sal@@ ads , because all features have already patented . &quot; it therefore does so good as possible and tried to recover those traits , which he would like .
however , however , it is very careful and ende@@ av@@ oured to use a material not protected as intellectual property .
it is also connected to a movement that is getting larger in the USA and anywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
ast@@ ron@@ aut of the ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS drew red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the variety Out@@ tal@@ es in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station bred and ate . there is testing whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it &apos;s no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather than that it would come from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , the alternatives to copyright protected by copyright .
it was brought to life in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and can be permanently used for plant breeding .
within the framework of the initiative , called Oss@@ i , US bre@@ eders could under@@ take that others can use them perfectly free of them .
this means , however , it does not mean that they can still do business with their seed and do not sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow only others to breeding their seed , and it is not immediately gone up - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plants .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
cont@@ am@@ ant prospects
for the emer@@ ge Professor at the Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Oss@@ i @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seed well and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for nutrition security as well as for environmental protection .
seed remains according to him that a role in larger jun@@ ctions such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little , by expor@@ ting seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with genet@@ ically altered plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genet@@ ically modified or not to buy inf@@ usions in the global agriculture industry , he says and particip@@ ates in the increasingly more common fusion products , such as it is offered on farmers in August and September 2016 , should also know that the way is bred , such as this vegetables is bred , threatened .
nutritional sover@@ eig@@ n@@ ty without seed sover@@ eign is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative also under@@ take to ensure other plant seeds are still free to make their seed well . unlike that , seed and vegetable features are in patented .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Oss@@ i &apos;s suppor@@ ter , argu@@ ing that the future of food supply is end@@ anger@@ ed , as the available non @-@ quality intellectual property rights based on plant material , that is thus always restricted , un@@ exp@@ ire .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genet@@ ically variation involving carrots and their availability . it found out that approximately one @-@ third of all cart@@ ograph@@ ical features are protected as intellectual property , making it suitable for all plants either .
for other plants , there are still not yet other estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by su@@ es that mass cultivated plants like wheat in even greater style are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or carrots .
a question of perspective
plants are cultivated so that they have targeted features - from such that their taste or their color improves up to such , due to those who flour@@ ish in certain environments and threat@@ ening diseases such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents based on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders protected by more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently more need@@ less than ever since the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail mon@@ me@@ to @-@ spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ ction Activity . with a total of four com@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agri@@ cultural Ministry of the United States , the company established itself for the conservation of the genetic diversity .
it does not contra@@ di@@ ct that intellectual property will promote other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of vegetable di@@ ets innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken to plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ res .
often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method .
such protection has not been con@@ hib@@ its innovations , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how are available . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks the other way : 20 years waiting for a patent , and it certainly will be no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to keep plants , which are adapted to the modified environmental conditions , the fight had already been lost .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources always have been a general practition@@ er and still should remain . &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and month incenti@@ ves are not attractive for us .
we want to simpli@@ fy their work .
this is what makes us feel , and it is impossible to use it if we do not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on refers to the concept , vegetable features : &quot; we are not really creating the characteristics of itself .
the plants form them themselves , and as bre@@ eders finally we do not have ancestors , such as plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Min@@ pe , plant breeding in the US State , Oregon and Oss@@ i @-@ executive board , there is still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breeding a variety , also att@@ ests his own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , are needed for growing Her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de to cultiv@@ ate the varieties of agriculture in its varieties .
my concept is anti @-@ fal@@ sely . &quot;
while a few medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , it also re@@ ject the most smaller seed companies - either re@@ ject or maintain it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile , or both is the case .
the independent plant breeding Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in its breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders could be innovative by the oid of plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like that I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented .
I need a constantly new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent is one for 20 years ahead of competition , how to make it pretty good . &quot;
although the U.S. seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly across the whole world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as professional organization in the area of resources , is an &quot; open source &quot; seed program . for the preservation of traditional commercial plant varieties , the centre with farmers are working together and helps them to meet new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also helps you to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed well and to sell their own .
the German Organisation Win@@ col is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of Oss@@ i &apos;s commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding @-@ particles differ from country to country , concerning Oss@@ i &apos;s obligation not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 the executive of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conventional plants could not be patented , thus it speaks for the present practice of the European Patent Office , which offers patents of conventional plants .
however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of plant agencies and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards Pat@@ ing seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos;s Program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed des@@ aster explains that the organization is currently supporting a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed des@@ aster systems intended to fall off the official start of the official start next year .
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database to plant seeds and biodiversity in the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed @-@ map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a group of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , published in the opinion that farmers have to ensure that farmers need to improve and improve seed policies , thus ensuring a stable supply which can be ensured .
in the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a varied , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context , from the Lu@@ by Oss@@ i hopes it hopes to see him soon more people .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods is particularly respected , where and how something has grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to clear the people that even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian government content on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of August the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Service Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network released a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian government critic@@ ised the stage for this step and promised to continue the work and effort for human rights in the region .
the Mess@@ enger for Human Rights Information remain committed in spite of this attack and the violation of Egyptian right and the Constitution in the Arab world , so it was never difficult to follow these goals , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI confirms that all technical possibilities will be exhau@@ sted to overcome and not ad@@ mit . we do it to meet our task to further meet our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first licensed website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities were more than two months 21 pages , as for example the independent Intelligence page , MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language issue of Al Jaze@@ era &quot; for alleged involvement of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web sides . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI &apos;s blog in Columbus , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for spreading columns and articles that he has not written in Egypt any accessible web pages and media .
now the blog , which he established to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government , was the goal of a attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with the St@@ adas blog is home , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013 , while he took over the student population and took a video like the police of physical violence against two students .
his article are mainly turned to politics and human rights in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada stated in the re@@ jection by the government and refle@@ cting what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but if the wave of blo@@ gs could not be important in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi , and even if the re@@ jection of the blo@@ gs might not be meaning@@ ful for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It &apos;s succeeded to mediate in me the feeling of a siege artillery ; an arrest , an attempted murder , inci@@ dental in the national Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) They have demonstrated that I wrote not for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience .
I wish to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to the post of articles to circum@@ vent the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after they have blocked him and they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or build a second blog .
the b@@ old are the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities open 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this was technical testing in the networks of different Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , among others Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE , also the blocking of providers which was possible by converting Internet access and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday the 12th of June , we noticed how the bar@@ rage of websites that offer V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block contents and to filter access to the Egyptian users .
the situation will as@@ sures that the interest is hit behind closed doors , thereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which they can proceed against this actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to walk with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day for Day reports newspapers in Brazil with more striking c@@ rop@@ es from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of many postcards .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es smoke pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ plate sends 8500 troops of the Army , Marine and Air Force in Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in an exhau@@ sted financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio has reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian non@@ governmental organisation Global Justice had called the United Nations to access the United Nations .
reports like these are all day and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 the editorial staff &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced that a new section called &quot; war in Rio . &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
moti@@ fs for their decision explained the newspaper :
extra will continue to report on crime , which happen in every large city on the world such as murder , spoil , sexual off@@ al , etc . everything , however , will happen to the &quot; War &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to close as a journalist not to close our eyes before gr@@ ass@@ y .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ ede@@ ter , editor of Chief Editor , declared that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of the failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in all over the world with a war@@ ri@@ bri@@ k in a country that did not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist discovered that according to information forwarded by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 .
in the editorial article the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to sho@@ wering the police , who only will shoot and ask any questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of m@@ af@@ ia and their partners .
is the designation &quot; War &quot; more than they used ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journalist in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , argu@@ ing that violence as a &quot; war &quot; was declared a just@@ ification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult , responsible for the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown by the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , re@@ conn@@ aissance and historical and sel@@ f@@ eit neg@@ le@@ ct of public service .
to memory : the Federal State of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; is wrong according to Cec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent available data .
no such towns is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at Mor@@ dr@@ as per state , Rio is on rank 16 , &quot; she writes .
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media group of South America , emphas@@ ised as Cec@@ í@@ lia , since years the security policy of the State is repeated .
the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia tu@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , belonged to one of the police unit , whose aim is to capture a Fav@@ ela of police and a unit permanent there .
at the beginning , this led to a decrease of violent deaths . for a few years , U@@ PP was supposed to protect the U@@ PP after several reports about ch@@ ik@@ ans and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to be able to protect the curious police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux made out of his article in the year 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio do not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention on behalf of the &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war is also serious consequences for humans .
for this calls for the state to use means of means and paths which are typical for war . this is the entry into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; and &quot; conce@@ aled balls . &quot;

one week it is now that the police gets the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho ti@@ om@@ m to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ emen .
in the midst of all these violence also this incident happened : an or@@ eller died as a result of nuts who had fired the police from a helicopter .

source : Can@@ do@@ k Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 , and in subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities under brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against lo@@ y@@ ale troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and the land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib , currently around one million Syrians in a state of the siege .
especially strongly affected is the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons asked life on August 21 , 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition derived from the basis of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acres committed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , those of the reb@@ els have stood on the siege of Damascus , on the siege of Damascus , causing hab@@ it@@ ants , or@@ iti@@ oned , or through tun@@ nels and inspection points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food supplies such as meat become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
in contrast , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , they are doing an attractive food source for many residents of the East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ torate of the Project , Nab@@ il , spoke to the French News Agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we decided for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years now , this project is well @-@ known and pressing his relief that it gains more and more &quot; at the school . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near as the humanitarian C@@ row@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to conv@@ ey 125 families knowledge to the plant@@ ing of mushrooms , such as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a on Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of this article , they have achieved over 100 % of its expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to pay donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is focused on generators which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity of 80 % .
because of the fuel scar@@ city , they are used locally produced plastic materials to feed the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a told Global Vo@@ ices that they began production from the regions of the fung@@ us , before they checked up their quality and they are suitable for consumption .
afterwards they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a large tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout the east Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that it is part of a major movement .
&quot; we want to reduce the mushroom breeding of various reasons : &quot; breach of the siege . &quot;
delivering a new source of food on the market .
dis@@ sem@@ ination of a culture of self @-@ catering ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods is used .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work home .
create new work@@ places for people with disabilities that are bound to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege of the siege is visible .
we want that our experience can help people in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires from 2017
several hundred people attended the 21st of October in many districts of neighbouring communities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that gr@@ ated in the north of Portugal .
two and forty people died , and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ places that spread themselves in the northern and central banks of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy happened where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest growth system , which monitors the forest area by satellite recordings , in 2017 , about 500,000 acres of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon .
so you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the location : there is no fire only in 4 districts .

the derived tragedy
the target of Saturday was the demand for improved pre@@ emp@@ tive and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked why the civilian population was not able to con@@ strain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João Innov@@ al of the Federation of the farmers in Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday did it anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads , surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , since the streets were very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits in Ö@@ r@@ t@@ ites are asked with a high branch of fire .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the Wal@@ tri@@ bu@@ ck , which brought the government to severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was en@@ ligh@@ tened by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investment .
&quot; the government carried out a cur@@ ative act of the law , which had the construction activity of case , if the applicant could be built on means of self @-@ protection , so it was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; carries out João Sor@@ val in the same article in the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the Quer@@ cus insi@@ sted that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ ypt@@ us trees , trees made of slightly burning wood , is like in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ re@@ is , according to fires of this species increasingly broad .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Portugal &apos;s civil protection site visited Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when residents were sought or tried to contact their relatives , offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information provided with information : they used the own civilian data using the Application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers João P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was decisive in this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the server pursued the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400,000 users that kept the fires : this website counted more than half a million .

the path of refugees from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eurs

in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air .
just at that time A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i in central gh@@ istan , last time with his family together .
even though his mother knew it then , she knew that she would not see her son very long - maybe even more .
in the morning the boy shou@@ ldn &apos;t break .
his un@@ cle would pick it up and bring him to the locks .

CC @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Haz@@ ara Party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was just murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara did not feel themselves .
the Taliban came closer to its hat@@ red for the Haz@@ ara known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in direction Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a few years in a coh@@ er@@ ru@@ be . it was heavy and made him ill .
then he took that which was left from his low wage and went to Iran . once again he was found in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow@@ ed bags with mort@@ ars , the heavier than he himself had to make his living .
at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we mounted nylon in front of the open windows , so we were not refresh@@ ed at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe .
if dangerous moves on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ cked and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ k was born in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice in the day of food .
it is true that Italy is due to relatively high growth quot@@ as for the past asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true also that the conditions that apply to asylum in the country are cat@@ astroph@@ ic .
the human rights organisation Commission Liber@@ ian Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suffering under a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified staff and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to the Italian law , As@@ ylum may only be assigned to an admission centre if they officially have a request for asylum - which can be applied for months after registration of the asylum application .
till then there are people who have no money for an accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road .
so it had also A@@ shar@@ k .
but his un@@ mist@@ akes life helped A@@ shar@@ k to free himself from these conditions .
after he had made several years of work in construction industry several years , A@@ shar@@ af acquired its entire savings in the founding of a host@@ els in Venice .
it was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while still opened a second hostel .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now the theme of the handic@@ apped Venice luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of directors Am@@ in Wah@@ i@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 .

the terms of entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
lots of bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of obstacles .
according to the official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
over the past few years some of Afgh@@ ans created companies , including cutting shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ ani restaurants were even blessed in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Oriental experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly composed of various parts of the world .
the men@@ ue of the restaurant tells of the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
Afgh@@ ani business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Cab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome there are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims are enough to go far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic industry and retail business , and aim to the country which he had to leave ( te@@ ens ) than te@@ ens .
&quot; where a risk is , there are ways , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I would like to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my land and I can &apos;t live happy when I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities like all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af fe@@ eds also plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , in which people can learn packaging and preserv@@ atives . &quot; thus , they can sell their seri@@ ousness in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; says he .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eurs was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubt but at the end the stability and prosper@@ ity stood .
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans along this way .
