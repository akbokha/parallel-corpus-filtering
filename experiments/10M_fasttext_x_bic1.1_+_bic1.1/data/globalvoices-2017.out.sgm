<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would have been living there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">How many of my generation I grew up with American films, I have read American music, American authors, and operated by his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I saw 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearful reporter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura student of a oil spades, which had been tilted to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "I was it if the absolute truth is, forget everything else I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only amplified my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I ever lived ever, whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shutter love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the guardians and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me like it goes with its Engacy.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, he never holds behind the mountain, how to say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he considers, as a former colleague it express, and explained his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and agreed to him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won in the republican elections, was the highest number ever since.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans to support this bigsman, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to bring Trump and his voters I could not know with people who had learned during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalistic program, people from all over the world, took a deep breath that I had talked about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps did not agree with the editor of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also standing in contrast to the generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who struggling with Sandy Bahr, who struggled with the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits them to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, which always helped me with a lot of patience and wormwood and my colleagues helped us to get to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">Those people and those caused by them embraise my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump sum up his way to the nominal republican presidential candidate, they bring to me a stop and counterpart in his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The struggles with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either parted his racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, caused me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump-voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To defend the people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectfully and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes are not taken into account in their congregations.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters voted, of which the most white are tuned for Trump because they would like to win control over a country you have disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly mention the words by David Remnick, who doesn't hesitate to raise a man with contempt to those who look down differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (m.).: as much as "Rejection of White against all other Ethnias," word game made of white in action at the White and whiplash, which means the great Van Jones called exactly what America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions people around the world estimate the American Ideal - whether the myth or reality, it's nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you can always have, America is welcomed every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he says, nowhere else would be possible in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white Americas this promise and said: to Hell with versatility, religious freedom and all the term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11 the white man again on Ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all I think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">In a demonstration of Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" he asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a space in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the amount confound the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos become a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone know, who is not so as you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a vote and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended with the words: "God be thanked, Mr. Trump, isn't it your America." 36 hours later he was conferred.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps Land, told the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people, like Mr. Khan, could not find no more space in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this is my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero commune in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the Paraguayaean town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played at both places is not only changed the life of children, but also have a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, who lives with the drop</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists, but rather far from the nearby precolonic ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a few years now La Banda de Música (Musibande) in the village: one from children and an adult, symphony orchestra, which has found one way to overcoming the surrounding of them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A musical school with 100 students became a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for its use of drugs and the banker force.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth has made such a rare hopelight of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very serious, the local press noticias Oaxaca, NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from the school they run back home and immediately after lunch, they run through dusty roads to follow their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come up and play with shiny eyes and play in the Trujbel for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from litter</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically up on the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital city - on instruments which are made of recovered waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments produced from local firm waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling was begun under Favio Chávez to turn parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, violas, Celli, double basses, guitars, saxophones, trumpets, trumpets, trombones, trombones and percussion, all of which have been produced from rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, of Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez reminds of a local Ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura at the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no space for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where parents worked no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a violin made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra which play on instrument made of recycled material and calls for the recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation of the "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance to:</seg>
<seg id="91">Each year, the world generates about one billion tons of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live are the poorest - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something nice.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring scene from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="100">In West Africa, this ship was already known that this ship had already been operating in the Maltese fishermen, before reaching the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were raised accordingly, and had a little bit inclined to welcome a criminal crushers to their coasts on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized the ship. they refused to seize one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing settlement.</seg>

<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it wasn't possible to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative to cross the criminal practices and resources protects, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal fishing (Illegal fisheries stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that then had driven out the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "says Tony Long, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegally. this project provides FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so because it is extremely difficult to use, so illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate contempt of existing laws, by which specific habitats and species, can harm the illegal fishing systems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing was once exterminded by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, these actions will happen in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries may exchange with each other for example, to suspect lists, news to digest activities or details, which you have noticed during a harbour specklist.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i persecuted the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on open sea through satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships which fishing in forbidden areas. even so digest roviros can be discovered, such that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations show if the participating ships took a fish license, where they were on the way, and possibly even if they have a stray.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegitimate fish, on the basis of this information, the assumption of such ships may not be able to sell their cargo. and that they could not be forced to be forced by penalties, as in the case of Premier.</seg>

<seg id="118">And this is what we want to reach, "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm which supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win some 20 million USD in lost sales, which lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to the Illegal fishermen who penetrating East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish species, incorrupted the region of commercial fish from all over the world. under these also Illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">To their practices, these actions are such as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, specifying of imaginations, fish protected species and fish in nature areas.</seg>

<seg id="124">But a different country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this alloy hatch tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved with more than 30 trials.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks, found counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found it to escape and flee ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations show us rather far into the networks of organized crime "," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that should help FISH-i to be more precise ships with more precise ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be further developed, helping to open the Illegal Ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very ingenious techniques to conceal their activities and their position." "says Duncan Copeland, principal analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO that also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn for example their automatic identification systems, where they can't be read more by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find a discriminating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team in African nations can actually take effect on the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the sea protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be rendered to each of the individual traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"to be gathered with the neighbors to get a better picture of them, who does that - that makes sense to make sense," says he. "" here is a chance for countries to join themselves and to make their resources to investigate.</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this on a global level. "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run with which a global system pursues persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There is evidence that FISH-i's activities are not only crime crime, but they also cries out.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which are fished in earlier without license and hardly to reckoned with consequences, now know that it observes.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i currently accounts for a 33% increase in fishing sales, then fishing boats for more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had assisted Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board drag networks which is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also note these successes. "" the effect is so strong that we now also have other countries, "" says Kiilu. "" we have become a study project "." in Western Africa each year marks disappear several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">There will be six countries closed in 2015, so called West Africa Task Force. also they fight the illegal fishing, after exactly the same model as FISH. "" With security, the goal is to allow even more such initiatives and structures to be settled in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest members could be back to his first big triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag. and not only the ship was travelling on the road and were not allowed to use towing nets.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also included in forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" with the take of action against Greko 1 they made a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing catch, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative work has actually works in the whole world.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the official release of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close recording of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela has rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on the official position, the Venzolians reacted, in whose eyes negotiations ran on the political and economic crisis of the country, in which they gathered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the recovery of Venezuela) can be found both images from these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the landlandside of Barinas, in the regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the central north of the federal state Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Eparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation in the country has deteriorated steadily, in the everyday life of Venzolan through an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the official position of the current president Nicolás Maduro the chance on a fundamental change; ultimately, however, the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, co-acting with Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the Context of Governance in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the context of social, political and economic crisis, the inflation rate of the world's economy (the inflation rate is estimated to be 500% at the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far lack of food and medicine is the only way to give the country to claim its institutional structures and close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The election campaign of Mesa de la Unidad Orática or shortly Mud (about: round Table of the Democratic Unit), who participated in the opposition of 2015 against the majority of representatives of the National Assembly, and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, will continue to continue on November 3rd, should continue to continue the blocking of the referendums for municipal authorities.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter as follows:</seg>

<seg id="178">There, the demonstrators moved to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the government before the police and armed advocacy of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later, they were able to leave the cathedral again, but the protests continued.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of a interviews from Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, the origin intended on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to view the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now said in the context of the Great La Perla Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, were crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the office, the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military operations in La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he retained the family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I thought that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, it is not noticed that you are manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know that my father was a thief, folly and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarerieofficials. during the Argentine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of State terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the service division 141 in the La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archiving recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressed, who is charged with abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who knew the extent of the atrocities in the course of the years that he had experienced as a boy, and who spoke before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows that great power has a parent with his child, and how this child chose a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to bring me up to the military base, I often went to the Sports Hall. there I had friends with a boy who made martial sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father from him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo, and urged me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are a dickhead, you have rounded up with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they will not run you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation of the ERP is for Ejército revolutions del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back to the Sports Hall. a few days later he took me with work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He said to me, I would be secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and I thought in the situation that would be fine. for thus my father had gone up.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base I had to destroy paper, which had heard the detainees.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: University concludes, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'daunting the prisoners are tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla with everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he was waiting for me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he commanded me to get off. he led me to a Barrack, in the cars, furniture, television, refrigerators - simply all possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little into a blanket, and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that it was a large clumsy of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the Barrack, where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I moved in and saw a Liege which tortured on humans.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field of dirt and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that it was attached to the one end of a cable. the other end was fixed by the body of the person who had just left there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They enged a man with handcuffs on the bed, overfill it with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts to the genitalia.</seg>

<seg id="243">The stank there was horrible there... like a dirty Windel.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father got under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I knew the smell immediately and was clear to me that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forget that smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked me: how is it possible that man can do so much with a man?</seg>
<seg id="248">'i knew I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me in work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the detainees were filled with handcuffs and carried the eyelids.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, one of the civilians who was also indicted in the trial) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses, on which naked people were moved with face down, all of them at their hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the vicinity of the entrance, people stood still on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father knew that I saw at the detainees, he said, "What gudo you do so, Arschloch?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I met, Why did you otherwise brought me? "</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and was buried by soldiers and was buried.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father was told at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra some rooms were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck a man there and killed there.</seg>
<seg id="260">(according to survivors of the Civil Defence Jorge Romero, who also was charged in La Perla Ribera's trial, the student Raúl Mateo Molina was sentenced to death).</seg>
<seg id="261">Following the following Video, Emilio Fessia, the leader of the La Perla Memorial, leads through the former torture chambers.</seg>
<seg id="262">The path, which you come in here, is the way where they came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">If you look on the map, see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were given a number assigned to the process of decomposition.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement of above came that they should be moved.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the Euphemism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War spoils'</seg>
<seg id="268">My Father brought all the possible stolen things by home.</seg>
<seg id="269">Back then in the age I had no idea what the "war yield" - as they knew it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was later on the military, - I was in the Gendarmerie - I became clear that the spoils of the bayonet or perhaps military combat zones that one has fought against a enemy.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if you enter into a house and the fridge, the turntables, clothing, painting, money... as a result, this is no war yield but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always asked how my father, the leader of security forces, could follow in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer at the Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into an house and steal everything.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a crime and I said, And you, whom you go on the road?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded before anger, and struck me, and cried, saying,</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, I will find you and bring yourself a stand.</seg>
<seg id="283">We need any one another!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no only good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I showed a photo of at that time I had a jacket and a wheelchair of wool. both my father made from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothing home.</seg>
<seg id="288">Then, the defence accused me of being a co-literal in this crime. I said, no problem, they can lay with me what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was anyway there to speak.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the body is the last abhor act 'act'</seg>
<seg id="291">Now, where I am older, I am Reuter.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. if one has only children, one recognizes the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Well, you are excerated during the dictatorship of the dictatorship, but why the dead bodies will disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with her home whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost as a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I asked myself again the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They would have been able to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess, it was just decided to kill these people. but why did their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people do not have families who were able to pass their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abhor act that one can do a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when the democracy was re-instituted, they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remnants of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were crushed and somewhere - no idea, where. "one will never find something," said my father.</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything remains of course.</seg>
<seg id="307">'I have seen how people killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to declare it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even was with the Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought, my father, was originated during a conversation when he stood under house arrest.</seg>

<seg id="344">The sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto, which allows to extend his guide.</seg>
<seg id="345">The photo was spread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers from a newly opened center in which one can extend his guide, in the last month some witnesses of a completely misused translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">The Japanese word (Breifensha), the "older motorists', means that" older drivers "means, maybe - perhaps too bad backgrounds & # 8212; as" awful car drivers "translated.</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance and building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was divided into the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake had fallen to the translator Julian Holmes, a inhabitant Kyotos, was it too, who made aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun, which is published in the Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that nobody has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an understanding of the elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable, "said Holmes"</seg>
<seg id="356">The defective English translation was first removed. the name "Operation" (German: "fearable motorists") was later replaced by the appropriate, if the grammatical model was not correct "(German:" older drivers ").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police in the Kyoto prefecture of Kyoto was approved for the translation errors. furthermore it declared that the error had already been contained in the text, and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News set up somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the "awesome" older drivers in Japan apart and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denied as an appropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents are involved, but the reason for concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the prefecture of Kyoto, for example, 1,941 of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, the Seniors sent 1.803 of a total of 11.850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This meant its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period has risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The namo-mentioned reporter brought in the printed version of the article comments to the light which show the pre-parts some Japanese apparently spawed against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo over the translation error was given the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" fearable motorists ") not the reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">- "If a faulty isn't the translation actually at all, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="370">- "I don't think that this is a real translation error."</seg>
<seg id="371">There are no such comments.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation defects are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For considerations one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter also requires active behavior of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers. generally, transitions that translators should be in the target language - not in the language language.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French mother tongue should translate from the French to English as an example from the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">A lot of Japanese companies employ no staff with English as native language learning translations. this may be due to lack understanding, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some enterprises, who have no foreign employees, have translations made proprietary internally. then, the Japanese people who are considered best to be the best in English - regardless how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The advertised and enigmatic phrases which can be created by machined translations, show that this technique is still not able to replace human translators. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, among them also the enigmatic abbey, often used T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylized reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry nor acceptable, or at least harmless. but by major companies or from the government to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses as hopefully a serious source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="394">Other online stations handed over to the protests by the protests in Caracas, where Nicolás Maduro was contradicted by the government of Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and the Parliament's duties entrusted to the executive of the Parliament and the Supreme Court.</seg>

<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she started working as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay, more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a big family with little money has its underage son or her underaged daughter to another, abundant family. in exchange the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what does not mention, is that the children have to pay attention to countless days, that can never be paid and abuse of abuse and abuse - and all that cannot be raised within the framework of a contract which cannot be raised.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls who are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected coupon, calculates and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name the things in name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated for criaditas guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is also the family who are their daughter in believing, that they conclude their training in society, improve their position in society and to "something from itself" can go to another family. "</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand the family stands that the girl takes up and whose exploitation with faith is justified that there would be any chance that there would be no formation, and maybe even an hungered.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín entered into the hospital in Caaguazú, their bodies showed sharp hits. shortly afterwards, she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">It was Criadita in the household of the former military personnel of Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer in the office of the population.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived in their house in Vaquería, a small village with just 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">By the end of January 2016, Ferreira died with a stick on Marín, until it suffered some deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They faced concrete that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela fled the deep in the Paraguayan society of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They signed the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest installations and demanded that there will be no further Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Girl's name and photographs were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," complains Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control, under which terms of boys and girls are living.</seg>
<seg id="451">The Neighbours and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded an additional examination of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want that Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who had their Criadita to be sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes before a court, the case of Carolina Marín could be landmark - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo will come from court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas will not only exploited as working forces, they live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik she worked in her father, she was forced to opt her father and lost her father.</seg>
<seg id="457">Her brothers now had to go all work and began to sell on the street or on the market sweets to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital of Asuncion as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In their employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">Yet they had to share the time that you still stayed time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">They stand up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for example, they cleansed the refrigerator, clean the living room, polished the furniture and the infected floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The rather they were done with learning, the more leisure had her.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited, because they had to make dinner for their employer.</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture by Pixabay, modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary parties recently agreed on a bill to "regulate the regulations regarding the use and of social networking."</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is accepted by the Parliament, women and users of social media must be registered with government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, then there would be a place to provide civil citizens and citizens to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law, useful users and users can record their own names and number of staff numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If you want to do this, this could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedor Application, defined by the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video content and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced, since the draft provides not having regard to the principle of data, as Egyptian authorities should not comply with the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary and supporter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and a password to get through the firewall that blocks facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">That could mean that Egypt plans to raise a firewall at national level around Facebook. because of those he would be necessary for Egyptian inside and Egyptians, information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not yet been known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts on site are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the court.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, on German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly advise you to the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as they are violent on the physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I call them seriously, this means that they will submit a strong surveillance system to request a citizen or not. and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a judicial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt all is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first discuss the legislative procedure and the Constitutional Court before it debuted in the plenary session.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enrollment will be successful or not, the design "is in line with a pro-military mind in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no different Narration is present on the picture surface," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, Tamer El-Shahawy ordered a bill of law against Cyber-criminality in which a lifelong sentence was intended for those who are found guilty to threaten "public order" and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="525">High in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in northeastern Iraq, the animal protective Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq have to protect the spiritual Persian Leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of Leopards, those of Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to Wilderei, the loss and freight surrounding their habitat, as they always find less prey to endanger.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video, "the Persian is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and thrive of the ecosystem depends on it that a big predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopards actually in the free game is low and goes around zero. as the team in the video is that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera, breaks out Raza in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologin, Raza is passionate about any side of their country, which is not just a war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">For six years she has been involved in field studies with wild animals and educational programmes of Nature Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, she has been a member of IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and puts it to be a protected area for wildlife in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shanno, the progress made during the last six years, had been achieved in order to rebuilding the life of those affected by the "Three-fold disaster" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake that triggered a tsunami and an Atomic accident in Fukushima happened.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimplico-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which is in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture were a common prefectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and Iwate, forced evacuated, because the tsunami had disappear all coastal towns of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture of Fukushima still had an atomic accident, some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shenno shows that progress achieved six years after the local point of view to rebuild the local local city.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re-regulatory authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The accommodation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimplico newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare houses (Ambalai kouei Juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima prefectures, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi recorded the largest success among the three prefectures in the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas in Fukushima still forms the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">The same time is still hard, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelfsquah (that, Cauetsu Yutaku) to settle in final replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced into residence.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people still lived in Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such places.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency accommodations, whereas Miyagi lived even more successful. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated evacuation laid down by the desaster were transferred in the final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, this figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of works and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimplico newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools who were affected by misfortune, opened its doors to December 2016, resulting in nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fishing ports operate in Iwate and Miyagi, only 30 percent of fishing ports have been resumed in operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident occured in the three prefectures of agricultural land in a great neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of his agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only a result of the atomic fact is, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed arable arable land of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism recovered well again, but also Fukushima remains well.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are back up to 90 per cent on the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima still can have only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimplico-Newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it feels more difficult to earn their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a complete picture, the newspaper resulted in numerous unquestionings under the native population and among the evacuation by. they asked them concerning the state of recovery, and even as their indignation against the tsunami risk has changed.</seg>
<seg id="571">In the introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimplico-Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimplico introduced a survey through to bring out more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of the local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents have still not been done enough in terms of catastrophies.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shenno-Newspaper has raised its attention to the situation of the evacuated regions of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">In Fukushima never had to experience the tremendous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, prefecture of Fukushima had also been witness of the worst, disaster-induced, atomic fact that had ever experienced ever.</seg>
<seg id="578">Out of 160 000 evacuated regions of Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">In early 2016, there were over 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand, still 40 000 inhabitants live in Fukushima out of their homeland prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas of disaster areas, most of the evacuated areas are they must be consumed older than 50 years old. they must compete with massive building projects, because the efforts have to compete for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima. here it is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week in the intensive care unit: last Friday a police officer had defeated a strike at Goiânia during a demonstration in Goiânia. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest against savings.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who is studying social sciences at the Federal university of Goiás, has suffered a skull brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors undergo him on this Saturday and now put him into a artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photojournalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">The pictures is also known to recognise the face of the police officers, which was identified with a squash. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the Military Police proclaimed the Brazilian federal state of Goiás that Sampaio had been suspended until the investigation of the investigation of the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer, as he proposes in Goiânia with his impact on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">Would be a police officer used by demonstrators and landing on the Intensive Care Unit, would be on display for six months and the entire oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Deseralizador", a press channel from Goiânia, recorded by Luiz da Luz, recorded video on the grid, in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by police officers and several sanitation shortly afterwards to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video showing the same scenes, but from a different perspective, is also dipped in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the bottom shown clip one can see the attack on Mateus off the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family, which lives in another state of America, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brasilian Reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to remain in Goiânia, while he is located in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás experiences a wave of political power: here the activist Guilherme supported Irish von his father, because he was a occupied school of a WhatsApp group, and now we have attacked the very sad residence of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policemen who defeated him with a impact on the face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police custody</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to demonstrators in force on Friday the last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers lived in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for reins, rubber clocks and lacriengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police via speaker announcements on violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">It also includes a report in folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media street protests lightens the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a distorted glaze window to design them with a picture of the frontsides.</seg>
<seg id="621">To prevent the O Globo, the O Globo is a title story with a built-in-fire bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic basis, more about a broken window placement than the protests of thousands of people who serve in the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This is necessary to recognise if one is muted against any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, the term "Vandalism" is an absurd, disproportionate meaning and the typical violent acts of the military police will be mixed with the title "protesters" on confrontation course with the police. "</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Act of Álvaro Reynoso closed almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Gregorian Congregation Gregorio Arleé MañalI, who is in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill -, regardless of that there is no nennant sugars on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activity in the sugar cane mills were laded.</seg>
<seg id="629">After exploring the sugar cane industry in the region was silent, and the factory lost after and after its facilities until the rumours of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Some 272 people had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other autographed and commutes daily to the factories which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo "veteran, who stand up every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar tube industry did not stop its sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that in the eastern part of the sugar cane factories, there are back into operation after long inactive days, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers to have heard that MañalI would get the sugar cane factory, but that promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">Sugar cane industry has already been dropping to the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the Ineffness, the poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for a few decades ago for the country, but the poor vests are no more modern.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway line of the village already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they were unacceptable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories to produce the sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar pipes and the sugckering crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased before about one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">Between 2017 and 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report on "land economic speculative" from the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar cane would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="653">From there began the process of restructuring in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">It happened in the sugar cane Factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as a soldier, is known about the closure of the factory, is the word that he is repeating most often, "Scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those questionings are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to preserve the place, they were a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">The first letters began to come back before the first shooting year.</seg>
<seg id="661">This was officially recognised by the fact that only concerning the parts that would be removed, the address and the date differed.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulf Rosales del Toro, only the ministers could approve any claim.</seg>
<seg id="663">And from there the responsibility was over and the letters were increasingly frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut down factory for two years, and it was one who received the letters. "the country had no money," assures us. "</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the retirement in another system, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the commissioning of the factory, where it helped the construction of their construction.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part which he took away, he disassembled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most advanced industrial sector developed by Cuba and the most important workplace was extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases no alternatives for labour and services, which were generated into the parishes, were created, in which they were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the mammoth talk of 21 October 2002, the then President in the eyes of those present people saw that he had not been in operation for the areas whose factories had not been running well for five years.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years, the parish church Gregorio Arleé MañalI learned that many things are changing, but not always the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar tube factory closed, or better, when they began to move them, they also heard about to asphalted street, this also pensions other companies.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with already advanced age, Nene and Eddy other factories had to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were spare to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a perspective, many young people left the region at once.</seg>

<seg id="692">The young people of the First Nations communities in Canada have been dealing with topics that are important for them. they're dealing with Hip-Hop thanks to a series of touring workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour bring workshop information directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live streams.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with Cree Hip Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop indicates that the young participates in our conversations topics such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptance" or whatever their sense does.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked together with other First Nations communities in British Columbia, and was invited to organise a similar workshop with the trunk of the winesago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kiteucalum First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," on which nearly two dozen women have disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mainly unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemkhi Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate how important the obtaining traditional Sitten and customs of war in spite of influences by globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs were published in indigenous languages, although the young people do not have to rule the languages of the first Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagao Cree First Nation have recorded, the refrain is sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people took some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop Group, who gave them a stanza in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the Stanzhe stands at your disposal, as well as a translation into English, which is translated here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel that no one would be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on with my days on earth</seg>

<seg id="722">There are a variety of these small businesses in the tokioter section Kappabashi, which produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker WIM Wenders has documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">Most Japanese are these plastic dishes as usually that they did not take them once more. a new trend is now transformed into conspicuous mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">In Naver Matome, the blogger Minii series of social media links and photos to show this unusual twist with shokuhin reverb.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic grated celled mobile tapes as they are displayed in the Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of this artificial foods have been changed to kitten collection properties, as in this case, refrigerated magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shocking refrigerated magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the essentials is increasingly wrongable.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular travel bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For these triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile support.</seg>

<seg id="738">I think I will be one of the only One.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic grated can take also a less appetite form to surprise young colleagues or family members.</seg>

<seg id="745">A Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the struggle against that organized crime</seg>
<seg id="746">"for the victims of the struggle against the drug dealers."</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports in- and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trading" in Mexico the misses and mocks are regularly distributed in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa cartridge, pushed the stories of the victims of conflict entirely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent case, someone does not look at the grief or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every glue, behind every bone remains in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds can never be healing.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican Intelligence portal animal político is the digital project "Aprentia Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "dealing with drug trafficking,") is telling a voice and stories from people who fought in the struggle between the prosecutenforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Voluntary crimes can not only be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are a lot of profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close, because they are threatened with drugs and all the congregations will therefore have to drive a lot of kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "as fear lives,") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father, who seeks secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her father, her four sisters, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priests: "like every Sunday, we prepare for the task to let us go, let us go and go out to the graves after the people whom we have loved to search."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he was again back again, but he never came back. Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me, for I am now alone with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, which is also here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You agree to the insurance of my father, but it does not get paid out because who demand a risk of death.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where are we going to get this? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprentia vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not just show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts to show the fragility and the governance.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a Lesker of animal político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central almexiko.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution are reminiscent of the fact that violence should never be considered normal, no matter whether in which form it appears:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been aware of the disease and sensing journalism now since several years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come on newspaper kiosks every day and see the title pages with pictures, which actually can only come from a textbook for Criminology or from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only One who is mocked or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be valid for or this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">You writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin seems that he is great. and it's not normal that people will hear songs about the "heroic deeds" when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is more than they would have lost to those who have lost someone and those who have fear them something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are to be blooming numbers in a statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The ennia of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified that they were "abandoned."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to talk about that they are spared out of such tragedy if they are not stir and still remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "four months Revolt in the city district: as a family with drenings has been sacked. it describes how armed criminals month had money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business but also her family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of all that you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never goes, the grief remains, the fear comes back up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it's absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are away, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want to be arrested that others are arrested, for one doesn't know when they will escape or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked me in these terrible days, if there were my deepest root feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the fourth generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he poses asking questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered in organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his old age, whose parents are taking care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells that he had to kill himself, how to make an egg cook, potatoes, tortillas, and "Chichi" for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water, sugar and milk.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left Bone - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable to a boy for the whole life of violence, and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day after his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had been over two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody riche of his father, who was shot by armed men from a precursing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organized crime and struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder according to the administration of civil security and government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor counted 3103 Morde. this is equivalent to 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that organised the organized crime in Mexico and enter the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live in view of the new headlines. this project reminds us of those who have not to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprentia Vivir Con El Narco, called the Data journalism project Narcdata into life, whose goal is to depict the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trading, which has been tortured to the country in the past four decades.</seg>
<seg id="816">When a picture is worth a true words</seg>
<seg id="817">"Sharing is Caring" from Flickr-User Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNUNG: this post and the sides, to which it owe, contain images on which violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment in which it comes to raise a rumor or to expose a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is this year after something happened in the first time? content in social media, no matter whether true or unreal, tends to stand further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been exploited to help such tragedy that have been held in Nigeria or Myanmar since its first release.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false copy of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denied not the fact that there are plenty more careful coverage of events in the DR Kongo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it casts questions about our desire to images on news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tankers crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tiled and exploded. 230 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the Civil War, Africa had been neglected for years, and devastated the streets of the region, the streets in the region were made of dangerous acclaim that were difficult to travel.</seg>
<seg id="827">It fell victim to the tankers to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Government officials will described a fireball, dozens of dozens including houses that was full of people who've been full of people who illustrate the soccer world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses tortured and sealed lids were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the unmistakes.</seg>
<seg id="831">An image with the title "This is Nigeria." from Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the previous day make the gray-full scenes of that day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonized body that are spersed on the floor while taking it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here it is not the end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was put out several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, so real was not so real, but not in the context of bearing stippers, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the kidnapped Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Augenzeugen reported drastically of atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the numbers could not be confirmed but nobody remained to count to count to count, "said a people on Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were raced, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only based on satellite images the follow-up could be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unexplained, but the army point of Baga was a permanent conflict between the army of Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram, land to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here shows the picture from the DR Kongo on, as a proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">Massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misused use of the image of the DR Congo is only one in a series of false bugs; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these instances the image was placed as a letter for massacres.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further refine your personal comments such as this example, by the DR Kongo on the sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange came also in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message, published by the United Nations released their wounds, rape and some dead, some of which are burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on violence against the Rohingya reported, postgs appeared as the following that these descriptions were merged with photos from the DR Kongo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture was taken by an acidi-Arab message, which was claimed in 2012 that President Myanmars Thein proclaimed, monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from the DR Congo to photograph this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was last updated on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news bodies, the AFP did as their source, had also falsely attributed to His testimony, but had not taken the picture from the DR Kongo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of this false coupling jumps back to the years 2011 and 2012 and come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">With a "reverse photo search", you can see how far information can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 images in 344 at the search engine showing images from the DR Kongo on May 3, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixture of private parties, platforms of social media and community and national publications and are in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some false reports have passed, and others have tried to expose the forfeits.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have examples of the abuse of abuse and associated with their respective countries, on which page they were published, so we want to represent the range of clearer than the language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">Several examples of misused use can be associated with each other (in some cases).</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the now dissolved news page Análisis Digital, has explicitly stated that the picture was not taken by the killings but it claims to have a "similar dShihadistic attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">As the picture was later, in connection with the massacre of Boko Haram from 2015 in circulation, the newspaper El Pais tried to resist that there was links to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyordyaUyuy" (Nigeria burns, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Kongo appeared with this Twitterhashtag and dissolved a discussion within Muslims after the massacres of the Boko Haram 2015 and the stop at Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities proclaim these events that were in the name of the Islams, a bigger attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was wiweed as a letter for the massacre of the Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9.300 times rescudes), but the messages that were associated with this were examined in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of the media reports in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (ese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message was allegedly written by an "Father Juan Carlos Martos" on the Nigerian massacre, it was placed in circulation like this here in Vietnamese and declared it to the falcons.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the embassy in which the picture was contained from the DR Kongo, the organisation of the Claretiner Missionaries and Padre Juan Carlos Martos.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of a defective use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">Based on other accounts, aggregators and sites in the following countries (on the folder in grey), inks are also not completely traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, the Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the webcrawler and concealed them about image file names associated with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010, the picture finally carries a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (radiotation) which postponed these posts. the first frame focusing on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in respect to major discussions about the silence in the context of murder of Muslims, or the defense of Muslims - the encourages of the Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second buggy use the image to discuss how a African life is rated as opposed to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth to investigate the images in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens if readers cannot give this pictures longer than belief.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are zig people who have unintended to share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are true and decorates the real horror of what actually occurred in the DR Kongo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images was already debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">A argument is that the relaying of pictures of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, care is that forcible pics readers and viewers who take the ability to empathy Empathia (such as this study conducted, as forcible media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there will be a lot of expectations regarding the media media, fact, fact that they are essential for the present news coverage are essential.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". they will thoroughly rethink about situation in which a painting is slightly sugars, which can be superseded in context or completely misused manner.</seg>
<seg id="940">Each examination of false grants should also be taken into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name of intranslatable (such as Ded. irreplaceable) endeavoured to offer voice inspections from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in each language: they press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unnecessary words are already well-known (like the famous portuguese acid) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sbrakes).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist hard-persistent every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not sufficient, why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">This unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole time.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, during the author and linguist by "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog one finds the words from the VAT of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemure yourself for your parents in recognition of how much for yourself in your younger years have laboured.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language, which are spoken in parts of Brazil as:</seg>
<seg id="954">Kwadi "- The convenience or sloth, that feels it, after being washed at cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds his words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They crack other cultures, unveil other thoughts and wake our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we want to analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page still want to publish more of this "unceable" words and show how differently, valuable and impressive these small languages.</seg>

<seg id="1000">We are located in a sea of Rainbows and people, some keep the iconical picture of a woman with headscarf, bound out of an American flag, other sketting slogans against Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="1001">My girlfriend look at me and says: "these things do not affect you, or?" why, because I am not Muslima?, "I wonder.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I have already taken this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I have been working or people who know me since years - the Sahel that they know - from the well-known concept of "Muslims," which has built up in her idea.</seg>
<seg id="1004">You are muscled me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practiced our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We agree to be a Muslim, on different types. but somehow we all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is well constructed in our collective presentation of such a way that as soon as I do not fit there, be muscled.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be muscled</seg>
<seg id="1011">I do not stand alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This is even the poet, whose poetry is most sold in America: Rumi.</seg>
<seg id="1013">What pictures are in the sense when you think of it?</seg>
<seg id="1014">Love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">As Jalaluddin Rumi was so old as I was now, he was a orthodox Muslim Preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Quran, and Prophet Muhammad, were up to the day when he died, the center of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western introduction, religion was removed Rumis, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This clearing makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims from this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another exists in the inductive images of Muslims, Western books had been colonised for centuries since centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This loosening image language is determined by the dark man whom you should fear and the exotic woman that should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The pioneering Palestinian scientist Edward Said broke out the story behind this pictures in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1023">But these pictures are still visible even today.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Our politician, the news and Hollywood, continues to store her.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I've been working in the news industry for 10 years and I've seen how to dominate this powerful, defective narrative our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This Narrativ overshadowing the reality that in the last three decades, nine Muslim women have led their countries, while the US could not even choose their first female presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This Narrativ failes to recognise that when French, Muslim women have to be prevented on public buildings, Muslim women with their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group exerts his "control" to the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This powerful Narrativ weakens Muslim women to conduct the movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It looks like that the first Muslim prayers had been spoken on American soil by Afrikaners who had been killed here with slave schip.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This Narrativ has occupied our collective bartering force deep and defective that frequently Sikh men and children are becoming antimely hard attacks and chicanings.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of this stories we tell us and because of the kind, in which we tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1.7 billion people</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry, we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create Narrative, who help us to understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry is well failed to capture the Narrativ of the 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1039">And we have failed to make seven million Muslims who make up the "religious group in America during the highest degree."</seg>
<seg id="1040">More than one-third of the total Muslim population are African Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation that come from 77 countries.</seg>

<seg id="1044">Four decades ago, my immigrated parents came to New York to live in order to live the American dream.</seg>
<seg id="1045">My mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard into the skyscrapers of New York; Wolkskyscraper were made possible by the Muslim, American scholars from Bangladesh with the name Fazlur Rahman Khan.</seg>
<seg id="1046">At that time when Khan had re-thought a new Skylines of the world, my parents were abdicated Muslims and Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1047">But now I got tired of Muslima and American?</seg>
<seg id="1048">Sometimes if people ask me why I don't ask a pork, I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or to bring my handful handkerchoral, whom all Muslims carry in themselves - "from respect to Peppa Wutz"</seg>
<seg id="1049">I kidding, we do not wear all of the pocket fans with us.</seg>
<seg id="1050">We also have to be no theological experts to be "Muslim" or almost always for additional security checks at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="1051">There are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars, Muslim activists and religious activists, who endeavour to fight widespread lies about Islam.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These lies are produced at the current volume of a well-decorated Islamic portfolio of money, think tanks and experts for grooves which have already been a Muslim point of what is a Muslim; or of what Islam is, manipulated.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Because of the stories we tell us and because of the kind, in which we tell them, Islamophobia is more than just a stranger that breaks the headscarf in more than just a strange woman.</seg>
<seg id="1054">Or as the terrifying card of attacks on mosques in the whole USA, see below.</seg>

<seg id="1061">I was born as Muslima but a Muslim force was born only when I was four years old when I was four years old in a provisional mosque in the basement of a presbyterian church in New York.</seg>
<seg id="1062">When social scientists describe religious life, they look back on the following terms: believing, behaviour and affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1063">My Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible, but they are there.</seg>
<seg id="1064">Maybe I would see my girlfriend, my neighbour, my rock in the surf that I am Muslima when they may look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that may separate our houses.</seg>
<seg id="1065">She would see the allendental ritual with my daughter when I kept them in my arms and called the Arab verses to protect the Koran and the Quls.</seg>
<seg id="1066">I repeat three times each of them.</seg>
<seg id="1067">Therefore I pray that it is protected from evil, the evil one can see, and that man may not see.</seg>
<seg id="1068">My musliman faith is possibly not always visible, but my Muslim affiliation is always a part of my shadow.</seg>

<seg id="1073">Muslima means to speak the prayers they told me when I had a bad day.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Muslima is there, as she has brought me to relate to God: Allah Mian, what God is, my only Lord.</seg>
<seg id="1075">For a nation that was founded - over centuries - by a "imperium" colonial, which has established a company with the name of the British East inizodi- Kompanie, it has a deep significance to God to give my Lord my Lord.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to occur here and now in spite of a language barrier to someone with someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robiln Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the creation of stories in their original language a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported short talk about an other initiative of Steven Bird, the Unforgettable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, the focus of TLS is not written on the written extent, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and offise the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite small languages are not given to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world may be avoided when we have cities to accept diversity - safe spaces in which residents do not forget to include them.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listen often," we are often listened to understand "these events instead" to listen, feel to feel. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storyteller will first translate their story in their own language and translate or explain away in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not a professional source of history, their devotion and their representation is that the audience listens to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the story of history is Rassidatou conate also the opportunity to explain to the country of typical customs of customs.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the cable of the hasen and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he explains the importance of his piglet, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand the language?" with a wide grinsen, he splits his feel of Inklusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">To date, the events of the Treasure Language Storytelling has taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can come into contact with TLS to organize their own history of history.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new investigation of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars on April 3, 2017, several religious and civil organizations involved in a mass demonstration; the march was started at the puertoriak Capitol, the government building of the capital, and ran until the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">The group was proclaimed by the group's "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (civil front for the Neurath of debts) and the Öenical Church Assembly Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercession of the debt reduction of debts have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos urges that politicians, banks and government authorities that are responsible for debts to their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial testing and a financial committee without personal interests to public debts, with a firm, our work conditions corresponding remuneration, which agates in favor of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ros refuses to pay an guilt that is not their.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners do not get retired with sinking pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We require instant measures.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not in the State Railways of the USA - suffer from a serious financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," an anti-governmental non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on the socioeconomic development, a law for state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state view.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of the government infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">The measures imposed by the outside are threatened without participation and production of citizens from the people to be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration brought the name "Nightwatch for Light and Truth."</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian Palestinian company Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing in a year since more than a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for its freedom and recall the contributions which he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, an scientist of the UK-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquay (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available here, contains a range of inserts that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it reads:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to be structured as movements for freeches knowledge and what are the real cost to which this is connected to them.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, designers, researchers, and authors involved in the movements for freeing knowledge have been working on page to create over the fog, which gives our newsfeeds and create something from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free the Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about its present state or stay.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice which would need to know his release, and they want to know it back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how to pay a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us will begin to think about their own destinies, acts and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we now here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we been given in this process by extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer of open source and digital activist has been in custody by Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra-prison, a non-military institution which was transferred to an unknown site.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, author and lawyer in Noura Ghazi reported that the "Military Police Basque wrote on the basis of a" strictly secret "by the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 which had submitted themselves as an insider of the Assad government, having regard it by a alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">But his residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Basins played a decisive role in bringing access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently passed the head of the head of New Palmyra, a project which founded Basque, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps there was no one of the bass prototypes, as the work that he started with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005, in order to virtually design the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the waypoint of many civil cases and here, the Greek-Roman architecture types with hiding traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Basque could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything that is not just the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This striving into the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be for the public as well as researchers and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">In this project, Basins could not close this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of their man to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom and basins taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I was overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned English to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Basins opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought others to the other, as they utilize computers, at least theoretically, without that they actually kept one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bases and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>

<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, Amnesty International has been killed at the International Human Rights Organisation Amnesty International at least 17.723 Syrians in jail since 2011.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption, director of corruption returned to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique responded to a corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus by the corruption of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is part of Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010, together with four other accused of undispatment of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, their council Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good management and immediately called his reattitude into the company, which happened on April 19, too.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, based on the application, there wouldn't be an obstacle for Cambaza, when the company moved no discipline procedures after its detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">But many of the inhabitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrating (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), an local institution that focuses on public transparency, sentenced to a short interview with the Deutsche Welle, the decision to start the director.</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a return in the fight against corruption and clarify the absence of transparency and even a return with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we should know that the company should have to take a discipline of discipline against the resistance levels.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was silent, however, no appropriate legal steps for applying the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambience social media, rejects this behaviour also and viewed the case as "contractions":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type if Cambaza was a consultant, after he was sentenced to prison in prison, and half of them had to eat.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay lectures and motivating words, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But when he is incompetent, he consented to get reintegrated into the company who helped to stop damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistible!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young mosaic and student of political science in Brazil, says the director no Moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded from the State because he could not believe him, I can't believe someone with such a way that has already insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the murder and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but himself only served on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza was the state used as a handstible money source and the state itself is tired of this man tired, that was preloaded and finally condemned to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man derart was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to recall the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief has been in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Sami Machel the Mozambique is not only remembered as the first independent president in memory, but also as a sharp, trimming and - by means - prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous representations was, when he was energetically confirmed that "an ambitious man was able to sell, also the country's country for its ambitions, to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Sami also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactic, but he does not turn away from its ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious human being is also criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also refuted:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat 10 years and passed free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today it uses him the company, in which he was mischief, returned to contract. # AssimVaiOMeurosis - indication for strains (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmish word "Kalar pae" means Kichererbse or age-aged.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social network went their net from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Even though the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective "Indo."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical National istical movements has given the word an extremely low-saving movement.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is usually used for Ultra nationalists as an article against Muslims who are a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to tackle the speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensible contents on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">Today, Kalar'mag is usually associated with racism, but the word in itself does not call automatically hate them.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; lots of people reported that postcard, in which they discussed the use of the word, or doubts for the use of his manual, have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore there are several burial words with basic different meanings that have the same sequence of letters such as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written by Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (age bracket), 'Kalar oat' (curtain) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The faceboothing Aung Kaung Myat declared the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was now deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends on spiritual kind, if they could not know how to alleviate his back pain, having made an vocal game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The movement KU la - "Cure" (KU) + The Frageword (la) to Burmese - resembles the racial expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win is the opinion that it will reduce the speech of radical nationalists, but emphasized also that Facebook should be analytical to spread out all posts that occurred in suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook is deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you are writing on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should make, is carefully to analyze the post and check it by checking the unevoluble words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (age bracket).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that this dreadful nationalists who hate Hassle has received a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their Nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the promotion gives a strong signal to all, the Hassle may distribute the efficiency of this strategy is not long enough.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship is often just starting with Katz- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will just start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook began to delete his posture, when he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I attentively seeing this new Directive on Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook with me, as well as parts and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post is "the" Facebook "standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posters removed from people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show their opinions against hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hassspeech by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author divided his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious foundations in the country are poorly poorly.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have to do more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community should ask advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a savouring intention to reduce racism in Burma thanks to its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words can be heard only more hatred in the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and so words like "chair" or "peas" "" "" or "peas."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out they did not make mistakes, they did not tempting the missing postage.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only some more respect for the 15 million people who have a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided lots of fun among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Rather than to take it, users are talking about facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasslanguage to see if their postage are taken from the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook post, which no hate contained, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission was used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmish Text reads "I want to sit on a chair and watch the peas and take a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post says "If you are a doctor, do you cure people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious foundations, which have used social networks, increased to expand their voices and their impact.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate social networks can also heat the violence in Myanmar in addition to the territory of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands of escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for his failure, who criticised hate speech to his Burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply read the word 'Kalar', it would have had better current to look forward to part in the context of concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>
<seg id="1340">In Trinidad and # 038; Tobago is concluded with the child before</seg>
<seg id="1341">A wedding ring in the sand.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The child before is illegally illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the country unanimously decided to unanimously approved the law that this practice is intended to provide an age-capable age at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the marriage took some members of duistical and muslious religious communities in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious group of the country gathered, that the state could not be joined, since that the state should not be pened, since that, not the maturity.</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened unobscent that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractor of the UN child's rights entity, the minority groups, aged under 18 years. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">The statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago to 2.8 percent, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's Statistical Office confirmed that by 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which endeaved to abolish the laws to the children before, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. evidently, they helped bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, it wasn't all smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-leader, for example, had no concerns, to tell the criticism of the children's actions, they should be damned even to worry about their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition argued for stresses in this actually uncomplicated matter, and sometimes came in doubt whether the opposition was to be fulfilled at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But early in 2017 the bill was decided against the child before - despite 4 transformers (including one woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained in the House of Representatives, where there was a simple majority to do it to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now just the President of the country must vote and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's transformers have released a status update which again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle to Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the child before was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes in favour and nobody survived.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having been decided in the Senate, the draft may now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were excited because the laws had been changed before finally.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who was a ministery minister in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has always used too much time and unnecessary odours, which has devoured the core of the cause, but do you know what? the child before is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegally, and this is almost any value.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was not enough, it was definitely enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was very happy that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Excellent News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Ehegesetz has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil group that spoke quite openly about how important the passage of the law is noted, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The married age in Trinidad and Tobago is to be independent of religious affiliations 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft for changing the event was adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 members, and 35 of them were present in the voting.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All MEPs who were toward the law have agreed for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's before is not permitted by law in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fighting (...) # childbearing childbearing.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">One thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu Organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Before the months Maharaj has announced his intention to bring judicial steps, the law should be approved, and it seems to be redeemed its promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney General Al rawi, a traversing of the law, thought that Maharaj would justly anticipate the law, most social media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell smote:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we agree instead of the discussion in general, in a way that we would need to say the state in our bedroom, "simply systematically talking about it that they may be misused by large, hard-churchs men who are needed to be misused," would you be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that there is no problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But if it comes to an accusation against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the children's actions are legally legal or remains the norm, although there are laws that they teach.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Hackers controlled the Office of the Swiss National Day against the Russian National Day</seg>

<seg id="1390">With mirroring web pages, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia article published in English on January 18, 2012, in which the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright Act was presented internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than one month, Turkey closed the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is more significant as important as the platform for users to find out helpful information and to share reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporter and fans of TV series are wedge against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques are used to use power tools for blocked websites (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), the most ordinary Wikipedia are not in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been forced articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been taking place regularly since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most illustrious country in the world when it goes around the solid censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are several mirrorpages (pages which reflect the content of Wikipedia and often be updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution developed by IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (e.g. calculator machine connections), which does not support the system of domain names and makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is also available despite the illegal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS report about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After having heard the news (concerning the blocking of Wikipedia), we set all of it to continue snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the contents on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users help at least all Wikipedia content, even if they can't reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also existed that this step was performed independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it only negotiated with screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, the Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consoli by Wikimedia, Italy has both tr.vikiansicyclope.org, an open source of Wikipedia, as also with WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can utilize on similar Mirrorpages when in respective country Wikipedia is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consoli reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and employees at Mozilla at Panigrahi's Open campaign "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is no complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One ripens to another URL, which is not the original. that's what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server guides the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia, when they are blocked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as it helps him to do this first-class situation at his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it give it better for a passionate game of wildlife!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home when suddenly appeared in Navaraj (the managers of the Chitwan Gaida lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I checked with my camera and it was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the Leopard was found and I immediately started to knee pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sessions aims to obtain worldwide recognition with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepals and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so furious, as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know, because he stood already on face to face to face:</seg>

<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sis placed the "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and they usually lived in a tent to do at Bardia National Park recordings. up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, which live near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was posted by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of an Content-Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with the greatest care, the names of their husbands, or even from older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, use a ponomic or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chesisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her husband, as well as the fear of the social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should preserve the norm in practice.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned by a court convicted and killed by her family and of the village community, after she had talked about a secret company with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives are not known in names, is also common in men. however, they have far been afraid to worry, if at all, they should not occur in practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health staff, as well as housewives, a unique club in and were thus quickly became the main check theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, to discuss the delicacy of the Patriarchate's patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, who are in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # Khelbadal, who is operated by the community Video Volunteers and set itself for the degradation of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working with the help of their video camera for seven years with the help of their video camera to rediscovery of HIL- and AIDS infected, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reports about how this club created a secure place for these women and made them at the same time as ambassadors of murals.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in her discussion round, did not call her husbands on behalf of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It has decided for this subject, because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchate with a problem to identify the women.</seg>
<seg id="1483">According to the names of their husbands, there is a bridge that they must comply with all "obligations and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition confirms that a wife respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't keep it, is considered to be a posterior woman without Moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made thought to this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband at his name, had never tried at home at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">In this self-confidence in the luggage the Rohini started its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After video projection the women tried to bring the discussion with a practice in gear.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini prayed every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, offended, sad, lovingly and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then asked them all, "If we can't tell the names of our husbands, but they can call us how they desire, does that they not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the names of her husbands over the lips," says Rohini Paine was born out of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the breaking of a century-old tradition, in which married women should never be out of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that they just occurred during the whole exercise just before moving, and another decided to leave the whole armament of frustration against him and his family, by destroying it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In the Adrenalinlet over, with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to work at home to name their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days, Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas they put to the women in the head: his wife did not stop to tell his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it during supper before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother in law forged her, she was afraid, and said that there was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less discredful and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini, as women have tried to stop other practices, such as the carcinoma of the carcinberred point on the forehead, which indicates the adultery status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the carnal red point, if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard that it was too bear to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped, but my that they are now in a better position for themselves to carry him not on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can discuss their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at each discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make sure that women could provide, "who could hear," says she.</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, she celebrated her own birthdays for the first time in her life. she danced and spoke about things that they had never made thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on this problems for so many years and yet I have been linked with some things, for example how our identities are tied to our husbands, never so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things to say noisy, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have talk about the concept of honor and related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried about Saris in the group since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them is okay, but some wanted a Salwas-Kurt, a wide shirt of a trousers, wear; they have not tarred.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After many dispute and discussion about the advantages of his own clothes area, the Moral associated with the Saris and much more, Mrs. Rohini her own pairs of Kurtas (shirt) in a discussion round, so the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can carry Jeans and Rohini is sure that they can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether the first discussion has been changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini said that things are slowly coming to the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted a couple of time but they stopped again to tell the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, included me, make it still, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the names of their husbands; only one or two women have a time Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion club realize that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like the barrel of more motion freedom or own clothes choice - at the end of a hard to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By making their own self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini declared:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman is in the club home and other people were talking about what we speak and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1643">After the message was spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope for an unconditional release of the expression and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question might be silly appearing since Singapore is recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be considered to be a city in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State Department of the State of New York, the minister, that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He understands that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked if New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, whereby most people go an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no land.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to turn "the logic" to defend the existing authoriental exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and offered to create this valuable land, we hear that we would have no land.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar that had a escape from before the responsibilities, a mandatory infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my land, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very Nobel: he defended up an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore not with other 'normal countries, in view of him, he appeared insoftened.</seg>
<seg id="1699">By contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the core point of the topic, the good old lyre of authorized feasibility, they have to be Democrats, leaving the turnable logic as they fit better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week, the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests on our press, our representative, our political system truly non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Relevant issues tarry with non-answers to rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to illustrate his mind, since they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore has no country, but one city is, so to which country is owned by our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our werter K Shanmugam would like to clarify this point, if it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog read his comment, referring to criticism that it should begin to read the entire transcript of the conference, in order to understand the context of statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore has a city and no land.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please read the transcription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">As he said that Singapore was rather a "city" as a country, "he explained why the elections in Singapore would be uneven easier, even if we are looking forward to ourselves and righteous elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He drove Singapore to cities in the United States (and how many of those cities saw a party to win a party in decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">As he said, Singapore "was no land," it is obviously not in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows its disappointment over Shanmugam, who as leader of a herent-growing generation, such as polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said to do very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee kuan Yew and the members of the old yarn, which I expected to agree with them or not, but that is a different thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubt and I'm not sure if he really believes it is associated and aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review discovers the weaknesses of Shanmugams Arginers:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr. Shanmugam "have committed a mistake on or was it a Freudger Speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">When Singapore has not been a country, we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role in the government's government, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do they afford their military service to defend their military service, but do not defend their own country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personal cloud?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">Tends the Journey Journey of a Decade to the occurrence, Singapore is and always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I haven't said what I said"...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have many people's more expensive...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked recently his editors: what is the most misused aspect of your home or home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their responses will be published here as part of a continuous series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world, and a different facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is claimed to me in Japan is: "are you American?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," let's answer me. "I come from Canada. I've lived and back in Japan since 1994.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation in which situation the interview is taking place, there is a polite to show interest in its talk partner by making personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In order to clarify the standard hints: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice-hockey, nature". many Canadians cook may be kept inside, if they are kept for Americans, but not bothering me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is a little one distinguishes us by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many canans get a Canadian flag easily visible on their backpack if they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans are the....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was even when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadian players have always carried small Ahornals of their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>

<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We are obviously very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is supposed to be considered the tolerant country over ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate it.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends who I admired.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would account for me if you would like to change Johnny from Dallas by car.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc out of Austin</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nett."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: as a "nice" refers to be diligent to be diligent - such as the benevolent, gentle, but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has a residence Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really had a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would be in fact a step forward. but the real problem is that "nett" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing in which you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, its inconspicuous and interesting to make any attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This may be something good if you want to keep unnoticed in the background, far from the things going around an around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go far as far as to say that the wish, free and alone to be a main entrance of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What kind of outcomes as "nett," perhaps just just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadian players do not talk about the fence across the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm-hearty, open kindness, which I'll connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) then Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice," our prime minister has made Canada only sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand famous Pop band has released a music video that the junta parodiert that in 2014 took power and despite their promises to restore civilian government, continues to govern the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his love his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video directly refers to the continued military domination of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was blessed by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a giant-success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Only in the first three days, the video was divided up on Facebook with 1,254 times and received 8,800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, Charlie Chaplin-Video has been blocked with the dictator "The Dictator" into Thailand after a group of activists trained to view this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can interpret as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies, inconsistent with the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Look at once these photos of the video, referring to some of the political themes, the Thailand successful in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" refers to the draconical section 44 of the preliminary Constitution, which grants the commander-in-chief of the army's absolute decision on important national topics.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program for the creation of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons, who can be viewed by Junta as a critic.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the Act on Computer Criminality, its vage and unclear provisions often used by the authorities to negotiate activists and other critics of the State.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose a new unit was established in the army, the online content is monitored and people who are accused of having prosecuted the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict socialists against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic damage).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup by the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to purchase, their decision to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts would warn that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it will be shown even how people are thrown into a black delivery van before they bring them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are sitting in prison, because they allegedly infringed "confusion," in society and an internet users are threatening adherence to enviate the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">The theme of the songs of the band, which had been cited by the Salut from "Die Tribute of Panem, who was previously used by coup" during protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1803">The following article written by Dmitri Stateynov, first published on the Website of OC Media, published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1804">The post-war society recovered only very slowly in East Asia, especially in the Tcarchal district.</seg>
<seg id="1805">It has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian-abian war officially ended, but its scars are still visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the basins of Asia-Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups like Russians, Greeks, amasies, Georgiers and Armenians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of Russians and chases are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are called intellectual property in AbchAsia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people still lived, today there are only a few hundred people in these clergy.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tcarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, 16,000 people were the total population of 16,000 people, which had hardly increased over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989, about 43,000 people lived in this area.</seg>

<seg id="1826">"can I talk to you?" "why are you talking about?</seg>
<seg id="1827">It is still unique. "</seg>
<seg id="1828">Before the war the village was full of life.</seg>
<seg id="1829">There were community centers, schools and kindergartens, all served by the community.</seg>
<seg id="1830">Now there are only paved road with inflatable splendour buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1831">The people who once lived in this place and contribute to their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union, have already left the district.</seg>

<seg id="1894">In Mexico, "mom Africa" houses the immigrants on their long voyage</seg>
<seg id="1895">Concepción González Ramírez is a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken released on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants attempting Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, at the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican female, a small woman with a corals-pink gold frame and golden earrings in a teddy oval shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. however, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This surname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) has become a destination for Afrikaner and Haitians who are on the pass.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 Dollar per night, guests sleep in simple rooms with grinding, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless there are hundreds of African and haitian migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez is telling people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mom Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently it is more quiet but this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She desires to reject no one.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them medicines that they can't pay, they massaged them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived in front of a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mom Africa was an appropriate surname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a joghatcher) posed with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to move into Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answered with a smile. "I really feel that it suits you because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">It has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, the hopes to get to Boston where to get there her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Afrikaner who are on the way to the United States, normally a first stop in South America and then to move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other riders accompanied by Mama Africa. "mom Africa is a well-known name on the route," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel together and that, Africans already speak on WhatsApp of Mr.Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of its leader, Michelet lived in Brazil in previously lived and worked as a construction worker for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa since months: he sells SIM cards to save the required money to get the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he is in contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our mother and we never leave it again," he answered for smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mr.Ramírez told that her guests often send to text messages when they have gone to greet them or to give her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They explained that Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They do not know much about Africa, but their guests have taught me to prepare me as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps well known here but it is not the only radio hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the town, a sackgasse leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valencia and his family have recorded migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is policeman and has found that the Busters are sold to a lot of African migrant.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, and he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hotspot outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert, and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was sent to a raid on his office from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels across Tapachula, comes from central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to press money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an all-known, it has offered its roof again.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives and she tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles they consulted quietly their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but it is nostalgic even because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother they look in their album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of their daughter with African hairspots that you made a client, some photos of their grandchildren and lots of travelers more, kids and elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1957">They laughs sad, while she preys me briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya is fueron," repeat every time. "you're already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjang on Twitter Users. Messenger Shipping.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the cell users of the Tianshan District Apostle Urumqi was granted a cell-notification, in which they tried to install a surveillance app named Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning).</seg>
<seg id="1963">The notification is said that the app will allow access to terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">But kos the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed the app shortly after they had exchanged the app to have a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the press release of the police, the app would determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists and would follow, along with "Illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults who was introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornographic pages, from online fraud, Troians and Phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend on online, and to control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This App with filters for minors should help children help to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can be used in a variety of course.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers could manipulate the home network of a person or steal from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China are mostly focused on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, milled ethnic minority interests such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinemaking on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter based media Outlet "images from" China "(" Export Express "), published news in China, displayed photos by a Checkpoint, on which police officers were indiscriminated immediately, whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">Authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification asked that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you have discovered an checkers with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a blow for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">That is a form of captivity by rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from" China "(" Export Express ") also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can raise a Windows operating system to allow unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Following the installation of Jingwang, computers and cell phones are in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang will possibly have a reaction to the follow-up of the city council, to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, authorities, and the party linked institutions, including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the Cybersecurity office during operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by the Freedom House, an US-American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang published the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, a Regulation with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, notebooks, and media memory cards can be registered with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos" and destroy this promotion, however, the privacy rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possibilities, including those who relate to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="1994">This is the first of six reports in series "sleep or death," where the activity of the activity of Sarmad Al Jilane is his experiences in a Syrian prison.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Far away from our blue, virtual world you look at and stellar that you are very alone at a place in which all the Important has disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Everything revealed after and after dissolves and a truth revealed that it is clearly visible, both from inside and outside.</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that makes her name all honor.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One, who are in a list of feelings and push down, that allow no metaphers to allow.</seg>
<seg id="1999">But if you pick up the reality again - beyond the scenes, the beautiful scenes, the beautiful scenes and the performers - transform the characters into beings from flesh and blood, and everything cries after death.</seg>
<seg id="2000">All the doubts are in smoke, and you will be aware of your existence, even if the earth is on the axis of the evil. it becomes clear that you are caught between the walls, your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone around stone.</seg>
<seg id="2001">They have arrested me and my father three times, but this was not enough to make "my lesson," as the Chief of Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="2002">He gave his power over us, by making even the most simple concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five teenagers were torn out of peaceful protests like darnel from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough to cut the city down the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" -Schreien.</seg>
<seg id="2005">All the neighborhood will coveted, but my own does not.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time it was quiet, regiming, in the wrong time, even if I found no high demands on a city that resisted to the arteries with state safety organisms and their compliments.</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night, things had something calms, after the power supply stopped in the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke silence when I cried several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice through silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later, some of my friends feel courageous enough to summarize.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Many friends, true friends open to me; we are allied with a wonderful picture that was my expectations full and fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="2013">In such a moment you are aware that you delivered the spirit from the lamp, but it's not interested in your urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2014">I received a call from my father: "make you ready, we meet with the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can't stop, nothing can return to you, after you have heard your way up to the office of security service from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I joined there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his males. my father was already there, just as I was now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The Colonel Ghassan begins to say: "let me listen to me as you are" Allahu Akbar ', or you are only courageous enough to shout if we are not near. "</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hugly filled eyes were on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and you mourn for me to see me in the eyes, and not on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="2022">And what I did, nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood before this building.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Maybe it was on my foolishness, vanity; maybe in the revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure that I answered: "I would not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">And I think I never heard of seeing you in the eyes, so why should I do it now? "</seg>
<seg id="2027">It was the shortest entertainment that such fatalistic consequences for me could have, and yet regret I not a word from what I said.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"he is in solitary and his father similar to it."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father is equal with it."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stank of this cursed is given to me until today in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">He became one of the "syndrome," an arbitrary torture which I was exposed for months.</seg>
<seg id="2032">I walk through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I carry with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Later again by the yard and into the second office, which leads through one aisle to the single cells.</seg>
<seg id="2035">I prege me all details exactly before I supervised the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Unlike otherwise, they have added me another cell in this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share them with only one single prisoner, and may put me immediately, without waiting their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">After a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the civil servants left the cell, and I handle it on an old proven communication method: to beat the fist against the wall.</seg>
<seg id="2039">I knew that my ancestor fin was a "Ersthainling."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long-tax collectors he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently there was none of the surrounding cells, a well-regarded medium-age age that looks similar to me and "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">In the perfect darkness there is no significant expressions in me, and doctors do not exist here; we are all just numbers.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe somebody, whose voice like my sounds?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All responses networks its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was relocated in one of the large cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will stop immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had insured me that they would be free when I stayed.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Lügner.</seg>

<seg id="2051">It must be about 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the screams, every day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that black and the colour of the painting, until I saw the yellow light, gave us the look at: the Raad (about: 'Donner, "playing on 13th scure of Koran).</seg>
<seg id="2054">"they are here to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2055">That was the secret to protect the sovereignty: in order to protect the sovereign and terrorists in us, they speak in alawitan dialect - thus they played their contestial recompressors and proved the narrow viewing field of their world view.</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a house, that is not a country; it is a curse which they call co-existent to transform the criminals of their sound in a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">I medically cared for the audiences and meet Abu Imad, a slim and stocky man; at least he comes to me so.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He starts a "pleasant" conversation, despite the facial expressions, despite the facial expressions, who are still young, you can do so much more important when you join this day and to protest against demonstrations, so that you will soon become an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I have accustomed to answer me, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really not say more exactly when insomals and strokes were made after a friendly interview for me to become an ordinary communication.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened, was inimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me told me that I had to be punished or severely punished, though I had done nothing to earn this sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2064">On penalty in all of its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this affectionately "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube that probably originates from the hook.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your Henker has caught up to your write.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you can't measure you with him, and you can't keep your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams made him not enough, so that the pipe was divided by a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">When my first arrest, I asked if the investigators had worked for earlier times as a refuse working day or whether it belonged to normal working equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables in each other to present ourselves from their visibility, great invention of a giant cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Three of them rarely changed from them during one hour while still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all my body in my body - and my voice, why I listened to shout.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The hen noted the cooling and found no pleasure in all, so he was the next to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed my whole body, enough to feed my whole quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-naked body, which was stretched out on the ground, was the perfect power conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The dew disappeared and the pain was again there.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been that at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep to sleep again; let's say that I was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours went that came to me like minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light meets the room. ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">I am answering the voice of a exhausted young people: "my lord, my father needs to worry about seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and quiet you, you will be relocated."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had been released.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">This photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib produces the majority of his time in the same time. he vats his screen down to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But after you can leave, a cigarette can be discovered between his fingers or his mother by Nikotin Immaculate lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house which had been part of them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs were forced to escape from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felahyeen (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For more than six years, Hdaib is an passionate activist who has transferred the conservative majority to the conservative majority of gender, sexuality and free expression by art and rapport.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often associated with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry, he also calls even the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics do not only be rich in its home town Amman Relevance, but also in cities that go to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders, and he may agree to the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though it does not make it open, he wins a special disadvantage against the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his co-feeling for those who are trying to do in war zones, signifies what he was born with his identity as "Palestinian poultry" of the second generation - even if he was born in Jordan and never before Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own living things," emphasises Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think," I am a man, while in the waters of dissolved Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; this time it is intended for Muslims from sunrise until sundown.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a senring hot day would be little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the gap lucent coffee and the waits of the Kent-cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under free skies, especially when you look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do with basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Minister Jordi has had an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some of the parliamentary parties that support the Islamic acts of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert tabs is.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former spokeswoman of the islamic coalition called Dima Taha Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "had been cancelled because of sexual orientation of the Sangers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim also, the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism, who authorize the old proven legitimacy regime in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the Jordanian people as a "progressive supporters of human rights, who continue to continue" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simply soothed rhetoric but actually clearly reflected out-crystallized reality in Jordan reflected in Hdaibs's work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib traditional Gender Equality within the body, formed in 2016 by taking his vision of the fate of Arab women who had vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a obviously unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women that have lost their lives by the hands of them that they actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan, the number of Honorary Mende 'has increased - the inofficial outside was dropped in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch therefore reached its climax in 2016. however, the number of honorary changes reached its peak; however, Jordan was missing the institutional infrastructure to support women who tried victims of murder and domestic violence to ensure proper way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a Law on Crime control from the year 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence, "must be imprisoned at incertain time in prison," and for their release, often a year-long bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee provided by the family, that the woman will do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music is enjoyed great popularity and is well-known for it, even did not seem to be soaked in its country for long as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib fests that his work is politically, however, that he is able to separate his music, full of expirations of sexuality, freedom and expression of opinion, not able to separate politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was tried in politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs that are politically active in the core.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song there is repeated one verse often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everybody else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the songs Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get what you want, "- be faith or non-faith, heterogenus or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of vibrations and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were still censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordanic Onlinework Program Roya, to realize that his comments were torn out of the context, turned aside and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded with cuts, but only a revised version," says he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is advertised for the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the mind that Intolerance did not disagree to the gay of homosexuals.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned in Abu Nudes, a poets of the eighth century, who still remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nudes ought to work once again during the job of the Caliph, in the eighth century, why can Jordan not go?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled, to do.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemic kingdom there is nothing new to devote the government attacks on free expression and that progressive voices can be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian newspaper was accused of several former government officials and members of the Federation, with the grounds that criticises the problems related to social media dealing with the depth of a deep-routed corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of its opinion, Hdaibs's concert is just the top of the Eisberg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanian nation.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, Mashrou'Leila has now been kicked for him for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, beddings and internal changes. it is certain that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian Society will take place.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib dreams like millions of other Arabs also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreaming not only to bring his work up to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is approaching with the help of music, art, and literature of a real and basic openness, and not caused by bombs, streches and artificial species. at least, he hopes this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Till it goes far, Hdaib will keep going on and therefore resist resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which is one of the student Fellow as a student Fellow.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant warships are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories as regards the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is believed that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of ponds, drums and dancing over a thousand years, and from a time originate in the troops of the West Japan in the northeastern Japan to force the indigenous population of the region, the Emishi near the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab a few great seats, therefore we have a great view.</seg>

<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital city, Meguro Gajoen, organised a double-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for a long time again the Meguro Gajoen: two fixed cars are currently visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori the only thing to take to Aomori the only thing - and again a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this history, because they are helping to alleviate Peruvian youth from the Crime and a legitimate profession as of the Frizurs.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historical centre of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where trilage and illegal drugs are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 demonstrated that 51.5 percent of the population of this region are not safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance, and thus also the unusual hairstyle of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), has caused more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairy, which can meet these elaborate hairstyle.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyle, which go to the extreme borders of fantasy, and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition's bargain "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There will experts join each other to show how to create them the eccentric lees, as you can see in the following video (further videos for current contests is available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who found himself in El Callao, found here a chance to experience their weapons against hairdressing tools, and to get their weapons against hairdressing, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and looking for bietizing possibilities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the post-article "love messages in guerrilla," which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel it out, affection to opposite?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Just this question went to the two young colony of Leonardo Párraga by the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation; inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters about reconciliation), who encouraged young people to write guerrillas's letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, her country was the venue of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after a long negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), who forms the slaughter point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was to mark the signing of the peace agreement as a significant role that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received for his services to the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Yet in front of the columnans, there is a long way until they can talk about real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who lived for many years in illegitimate camps, who were exposed to war rhetoric and carried out their weapons around the clock, to integrate them again into the life of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society again who had accustomed to life in constant distress and in some cases, they have to record their ranks and support them during the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian was convinced that the young Columbus had to join the integration process and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people wrote letters - love messages in former guillaries to welcome them again in the society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign's target are 6900 letters - one for every former guerrillas, who then to be handed in personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation emerged at the World Summit of Peace Prize, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian said the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people whom we love to write out thousands of love letters, but those who need them need more needful.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He has failed to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent matter.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan was to write letter full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make a discourse of a war story to a common history of peace" say they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would be forgiven me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono Cauca region at the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the General Administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogotart in the camp to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC on how they had done before to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no commands, but letters full of subsidy from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all those involved. "it is incredibly, how many different feelings one can run in just a few hours - from fear to Happiness and everything that lies between" said the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Valle del Cauca Province, this memorable experience is:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having handed over the letters, a former fighters led me by the camp of the Guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambook" (a sort of refuge in which the guerrilla live) saw, I saw a guerrillas who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because beside him on the bed a MGL-Granatwerfer designer, a deadly weapon in the village of Dorna.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Ever never in my life, someone wrote something so nice, so do I respond to it. "suddenly my tears were about the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">And I embrace him, and set me beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was sorry to be all the years of faithful fellow workers, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. the FARC was the only possibility to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I would never thought that someone would forgive my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company without a society that waits with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace is prevailing, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the outset, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC explaining the history of the organisation, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "many years many years have experienced, as we have the opportunity to develop us to a political party, we can contribute to help us to tackle the society in that country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">It's worth a target to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed with:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people have never heard their hearing, and had no elections to know, and to recognize that people who have often seen as a monster, and even hated even people with beautiful feelings, which were turned over by their lifespan and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, woe to me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comfort me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage caused us to bring us something, and a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the Archbishop of Cali in the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column was prophesied that it would reign after deforestation.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care, and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are ready to graze to the weapons, and that is completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We are at peace with the FARC on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - regardless of the race, religion or ideology - to rise above all those that dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution and sacrifice, for we know from my own experience that nothing is simple. that among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be pending.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines before several months, after reports published reports, torturing, torture and killing queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in Novaya Jeeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, suspected queer men, and they found it in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a religious woman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">She felt a woman since her childhood. she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they were grown up, you knew that Chechnya was no safe place for them, why it went to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had experienced by the sex children, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">She went out of fear for her life to the US.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">This was a friend from Dagestan, a woman, that was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he made a friend of mine documents and spread them everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya, who can eliminate these disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made possible through all WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On October 10, 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just going to bring a few shopping spots on the back seat of my cars, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned, I felt something in my body, but I did not hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on Chechen: "how long will you escape the family?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I don't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up last dudes in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had taken away everything and started shout.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In hospital I learned that I had two queen in my right lung wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which case fenders were laid up - in men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, since there is still my male name; but the doctor stand and laid me in women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I was afraid to do with the fear; it was a Muslim, an Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he respectable with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They cried to me, wrote me - relatives, strange, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of an alpine trauma.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some away relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested to send me to Chechnya to prove that all this is a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They found absurd receivables: some said I must prove it without breaking up the streets; others wanted I have changed in the official TV in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad words, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what should I say in TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people said at once my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the whole Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you because you are a pious woman but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she took a knck around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours and rescued them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 dron plate.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, I was clear that there was a little lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends checked the numbering - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I will not give her name, but I want to say that I remember it all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without record without reference, without any discard.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I dismantled my old SIM card and threw her into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Number was registered to a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plugged the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe me, you would have forsaken me, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which Hotel du stole. you know even your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This really was my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about the sex changes, this is a tobacco topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I have some traditional Caucasian elements still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very I want to be able to overcome this sean barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I say always that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we spit with camera, I would like to look on how the person wants to look like it out of their past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the present location in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed dordas?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to somebody who has one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told, that during the Ramadan there were no man arrested and tortured, but also that all of Ramadan were barely visible, and he did not enter a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So I think they would probably download the relatives with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so-called "honour" has experienced by blood genius.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: will now gay be kept imprisoned men in these secret places?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there wouldn't be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, especially those who have no rich relations or have been dropped by their relatives in order to set up Kadyrows Court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be arrested there, that they can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be brought, they will show their body on TV and claim that they had attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As though these people were not simply gone, but have plundered specifically to radicalize.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that only a failure or have a source of these information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I have just been detained for someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their Bart grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was also taken away when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now, however, they have not been presented as a band, yet there were no reports so far. we guess that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise should it not be allowed to shave this people?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if this persecutions and demonstrations of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already took place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've been wearing my hair always long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny, when I was still living there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">In Russia, Russia wanted to lead us to "civilian government, but ultimately cast us into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted and I had coloured eyelashes, bore the tube and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Department of Safety of Sharia never has never been stuck to me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ahead of the Russian theatre in Grozny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a realization: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "spotto not on the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is said to say often to children, when it was funny about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just got their eyes hidden before you, because they believed that you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never have been offended, never chased and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long kept this grace period?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long to Kadyrow appeared on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He didn't talk about us, but prevalent about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - it was possible to change how people began to catch in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had velled before and laughed, consider yourself at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the meantime, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic steadily slowed down.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity is going to do for?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Of which I still have been active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicating with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize Teetreff, together, I giate them to hospital and help them to get familiar cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no less cents.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered this people yourself when I halted "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's allied.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechnyan, who like to turn it with foam in front of the mouth that there are no vibrations with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have that the Kabardiner have, who also have Russians. they are on the planet it - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here as many men out of the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the Mosque and during the Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know how many think of transidity towards men who love the men and they believe that man changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a truer.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be precise, different environment settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not frustrate me for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm sorry so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now even longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not very sad at all - I know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn before an increase of suicide in the United Arab Ahmadazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">Iranian Ahraz region suffer from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there has been a strong increase of suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: using approval.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-combustion of a man named Jassio Moramazi on August 27, the branched situation of the Arab Ahmadazi community in Iran, which was marked by poverty and unemployment, the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he dwelt in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahraz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered among Angstony, depression, and he rewarded himself for his own helplessness to get the inability to his family, so Ahmadazi human rights groups working in Ahraz work and anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">One on YouTube video took the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it quick to delete the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the valley of Ahraz in the valley of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide committed in August within the Arab Ahmadazi minority, and activists say that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahmadazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazerawi, Sayed falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - to be hung up this month.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a matter common: there were all family reties, who felt thanks to the persecution of the Iranian government, helpless and uncapable of doing their families to feed their families and ensure safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahmadazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, located in which a large majority of which in Iran live Arabic Ahmadazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to contest the native Arab population to contest their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In a century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi-monarchy took power and in 1925 great efforts to complete ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Awaz Region there are some of the biggest in Iran's coming oil and gas fields, as well as some of the wealthiest and most valuable space for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population receives only little from that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Ahmadazi Arabs to systematically find jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These glitters have only led them to destroy the devastation region in the region, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fishing and palm trees industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi young people now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, registered that 5% of Ahmadazis, who completed a work that completed elementary school, 55% a further school completed and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy..." to destroy the spirit of national resistance "</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahmadazi human rights activist in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment, and racial ethnic discrimination," to a "high rise" the number of suicide among young Ahmadazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become more worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of native Ethnic Persian and an anti-Arab discrimination in the context of:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions are prefers to set Arabic workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will have access to all sectors in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regimes which destroy them to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs, and to conquer their habitat outside their native Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their advantages and surnames to hide their affiliation to the Ahmadazi, since even Arabic name may not be tolerated, because the speaking of Arab language or arches Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances which have to bear the Arab Ahmadazi, beat human rights activists, before the situation will be explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains waiting, whether the world awakes and it is aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is intreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is expected to be avoided and committed suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identified with the feminism, even with the intersectionality?</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is an updated version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website Afroféminas. article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I'm not a feminist, react many women - especially white women who designate themselves as an intersectional feminists: with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They are wondering why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even had a well-thought scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we should be in general all the feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money despite the same formation as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still standing under strict observation, when they are going to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards always ensure that women before or later in diverse areas of life to a glass blanket, and that discrimination is still across the many different countries and faith.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I suffer twice and triple them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black wife.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to skin colour, racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ commune, or to black women from the Diaspora; if I mention, on which kind of physical exercise, both in and outside of feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists have been silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they are all agree that women - all women are coming together to take "their voices emporting and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing" to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about sexualised violence in addition to sexualized form rassistic form of rassistic violence, which we have exposed to black women two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that, black women and women have less earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to school as a white girl, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black donors and women were exposed to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as the white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On one side, I want all the women, all the men and all men always have either skin colour the same rights; on the other hand I can join me as a black woman, in which the white woman stands to consider their iniquities in their thinking that relate to both the gender as well as in the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and won't be struggling for my affiliation in a white-feminist sphere, who always and countless other black women always and repeatedly rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Soyman complained in her words in 1851, "Am I not a woman?" and I also refused me to justify a ideology in which the black woman is a human being a human being inalienated and marginal beings.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refusing me to join me in group alloys who absorb our customs and customs, to drive their egocentralized program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to draw white women the importance of overlapping of skin colour and gender. because some of them will continue to decline the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach they better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was formed in order to give a home a home and feel of white feminism, still the word "Feminism" is still in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I preferre to release me full and completely from the feminism, and to join me the movement of the Womanism, who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman in life that is so persistent that Intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it's more important than ever that we will define black women to us according to our own ideas and give us into our offices, which are created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana uranism: how we can defend ourselves to our own art. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, body, physical and even the spiritual elements can be converted to the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately noticeable, after they have read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic area I can increase black women and women of other cultures because I live in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am acknowledged from my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradise.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black wife, can bloom in an environment, in which my life neither survived, nor ignored, nor is rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2469">Ever again, Nabil Musa traveled over the past 7 years - usually with surf board or in canoe - with a special approach by the Kurdistan region in Iraq. its mission aims to make people aware of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in His church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river which we had lost when I was a child," told Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of the war, the construction of damseling, pollution, and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate hydropower in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Watcheepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - that is committed to protect the rivers, streams and water trails in Iraq, as well as local communities in sustainable use of this natural resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question: "if we had no water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was filmed and filmed by Emily Kinskey in Erbil, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist, filmed and published in Erbil.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The emphasis on its work is followed, limited subcultures and distinguishes itself by using cooperable video photography and new multimedial techniques, with their help to tell their stories about their stories.</seg>
<seg id="2477">Paraguay women and their more difficult fight against violence</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and worked version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" from Kurhaus. the article belongs to the series # PorSerjer (# weilichefrauauaubin), who reports on violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protecting people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police Commissioner Ada Báz said that she could not work against Luis Balbuena, their own partner, who became a nonviolent venture against Luis Balbuena.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of its relationship has been some time now and the police said that its statement would be put to the acclaimed, but more could not do.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another Mrs. Balbuena was used for mistreatoning, the actenant display of Ada Báz is nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman moved her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Violence against women is difficult to break the Teufelskreis of violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women occupy themselves at all time, they generally receive no support by the State of State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women also are financially dependent on men who need them hurt. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in the prosecutenforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Holding 1 strokes and Statistiken2 Invisible missions and a legal system that contains nothing under nimmt3 of Paraguay: good approach, deficient implementation of strokes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to realise how many women really misused, says Myrian González, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports, but they did not even show the extent of the gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Attorney General Prosecutor of 9600 filed complaints for domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads in the peace dishes due to domestic violence. here, 86% of the ads came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women told that they were physically hurt and 55% of women have been suffering from psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show, however, not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraaguan women's Minister Ana Baiardi are actually shown very few of these offences. "on every woman who will be made in Paraguay for mental abuse, come 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">For every woman, that is refundable because of physical missions, two women, who do not do this, declared it at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Because women's murders in Paraguay cannot be adequately documented, as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists were at least 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates in Paraguay all ten days a woman died due to violent men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatments and a legal system that takes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was a firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning, it didn't wanted to do that, but then, however, it should be for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos. but two years of age, they contributed the psychic violence against women and at the same time the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never thought that I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read earlier on this, I thought that only women have to be subject to subdued, because they let themselves suffer from violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana took social media to tell about the abuse through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, they wrote on Facebook, in which they described his insure and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had insulated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered them on their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorisch, whether he ever lifted up his hand against her and refused to make his behaviour also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen so long by Carlos and didn't left him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like that, as they wanted to say that victims of abuse would have at least certain participation.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner she harmed her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo-CREO network ("I believe you") that consist of women who are everyone in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can speak with others over her experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case, everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner finally managed to convince her to convince her.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to smite them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias judges kept in the authorities without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against its former partners, who developed into a continuous legal struggle between Paraguay and its native country, in which it was mainly for money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, poor implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws, which are very good but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The ad of abuse is a path of resistances and a fight against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also provides great problems with the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, the paraayic Parliament was discussed under a bill that was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# Füri).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter, supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the Act stipulates that Femizid seems to explain and harder the case as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislations was modified in some points, in order to win the MEPs for the Law that is believed that the way for decriminalization of abortions will be forbidden in principle and only be punished by up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was intended to charge the most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process, which must endure the victims of violence even if they just want to admit it and secure a safe accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective when the legislature is no sufficient financial funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse was seen as part of human relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">This must take place here, that violence is not considered a bit of norms.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever touches these figures in view of the facts alleged in him, he is responsible for the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must report such a long ad until misfortune is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Act was approved in the paraaguan Senate. previously, parts of the law had changed, among others, a passage that had called the partners in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about changes are to be seen apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity to attack the aggressor, its victims again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," "political force" and "sexual harassment" made of parts of the law is considered a great blow.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than one year ago the Peruvian authorities have closed the an independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn, because of its coverage over corruption in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editorial's editors of the newspaper, is still in prison where he is a one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and restored in court but later returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said who came to power after he had made his father, Said ibn Taimur since 1970.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, he has been dressed in addition to his role as the only sultan, the principal officer in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Minister of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The rule of the sultans is characterized by the adharness efforts of security forces, particularly in domestic freedom, including press freedom, restrictions and defenders of human rights, independent journalists, blogger and other activists, intimidate and incarcerated.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activity in the field of human rights to systematically alleviate and activists, their views on public matters of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, her closure and the imprisonment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, in which since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman (a absolute Monarchy) was declared until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chief Editor of Azamn, established in the newspaper on July 26th, 2016 with the title "High-ranking parties" hands of justice.

<seg id="2587">Ranjite Warriors 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place using his identity</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is an growing area that is addressed to one of the urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need of medical research on site. there are two reasons to cover lots of medicines and vaccines which cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined in the poorest countries of Africa more than elsewhere, and lack of investments in the research of these diseases are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, continues to develop its own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjite Warriors is director of the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic first engraved on the national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later to Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, he researching himself at the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to assist the samic healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warriors discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and beyond the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warriors talks to private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjite Warriors RW: the emphasis lies on my work on the application of research results. I also underline the samic national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only rely on solutions that are differently developed.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That must change, otherwise we will always stay receiver, instead of the makers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often not suitable for use in our surroundings, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or come here, because the financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards of developed countries. it will cost a lot of money to have continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it lasts for months to import them from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should you concentrate on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are greatly benefitted.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life than scientists in Africa against Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed, things to do, and the most difficult access to scientific expertise that represent here challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can only be accessible against payment (so-called "Paywall"), also limited quantity of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, an magazine published on solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been cultivated along the United States since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 types of varieties, like the outset, the first plant, which has been cultivated by NASA astronaut in space and enchanted.</seg>
<seg id="2631">After almost 20 years of work, Morton's work would only be put forward by his own adversaries, and the question of how many sorts of sorts can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But in the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more salads were patented and that it could not be used for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain qualities such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or ruffled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more of such patents have been filed on more plants such as cereals or cartography. due to this trends, plant breeding, environmenters and experts have been providing food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">However, as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still needs a salad, but now it takes longer, since its work is still worth a greater extent.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it's like in a river a boulders, around whom I must embrace.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we must do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "says he." I think these patents have to go to salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new salads, because all features have already patented. "it therefore does so good as possible and tried to recover those traits, which he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, however, it is very careful and endeavoured to use a material not protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It is also connected to a movement that is getting larger in the USA and anywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronaut of the astronauts of the International Space Station ISS drew red Römersalat the variety Outtales in the "greenhouse" of the station bred and ate. there is testing whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It's no coincidence that this name sounds rather than that it would come from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seed seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software, the alternatives to copyright protected by copyright.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was brought to life in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and can be permanently used for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Within the framework of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders could undertake that others can use them perfectly free of them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This means, however, it does not mean that they can still do business with their seed and do not sell it. "open source" breeders allow only others to breeding their seed, and it is not immediately gone up - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plants.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Contamant prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerge Professor at the Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of seed well and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for nutrition security as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed remains according to him that a role in larger junctions such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little, by exporting seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically altered plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not to buy infusions in the global agriculture industry, he says and participates in the increasingly more common fusion products, such as it is offered on farmers in August and September 2016, should also know that the way is bred, such as this vegetables is bred, threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional sovereignty without seed sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative also undertake to ensure other plant seeds are still free to make their seed well. unlike that, seed and vegetable features are in patented.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi's supporter, arguing that the future of food supply is endangered, as the available non-quality intellectual property rights based on plant material, that is thus always restricted, unexpire.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetically variation involving carrots and their availability. it found out that approximately one-third of all cartographical features are protected as intellectual property, making it suitable for all plants either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are still not yet other estimates, but experts like Luby sues that mass cultivated plants like wheat in even greater style are patented as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated so that they have targeted features - from such that their taste or their color improves up to such, due to those who flourish in certain environments and threatening diseases such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents based on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeders protected by more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently more needless than ever since the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail monmeto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanction Activity. with a total of four combanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company established itself for the conservation of the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It does not contradict that intellectual property will promote other breeders, as "patents and the protection of vegetable diets innovations." "a patent is basically taken to plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection has not been conhibits innovations, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how are available. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks the other way: 20 years waiting for a patent, and it certainly will be no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to keep plants, which are adapted to the modified environmental conditions, the fight had already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources always have been a general practitioner and still should remain. "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and month incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to simplify their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what makes us feel, and it is impossible to use it if we do not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton refers to the concept, vegetable features: "we are not really creating the characteristics of itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves, and as breeders finally we do not have ancestors, such as plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Minpe, plant breeding in the US State, Oregon and Ossi-executive board, there is still another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breeding a variety, also attests his own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are needed for growing Herbizide to cultivate the varieties of agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is anti-falsely. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While a few medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, it also reject the most smaller seed companies - either reject or maintain it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile, or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding Frank Morton is looking for salads in its breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders could be innovative by the oid of plant patrons: "it looks like that I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need a constantly new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years, "says he." with a patent is one for 20 years ahead of competition, how to make it pretty good. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the U.S. seem to be a leader in the "Open Source" breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly across the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as professional organization in the area of resources, is an "open source" seed program. for the preservation of traditional commercial plant varieties, the centre with farmers are working together and helps them to meet new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also helps you to come to "Open Source" seed well and to sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Organisation Wincol is working on an "open source" license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding-particles differ from country to country, concerning Ossi's obligation not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016 the executive of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventional plants could not be patented, thus it speaks for the present practice of the European Patent Office, which offers patents of conventional plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is not yet a law; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of plant agencies and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn something about the "Open Source" seed movement and the global trend towards Pating seed.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's Program for "Open Source" seed desaster explains that the organization is currently supporting a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed desaster systems intended to fall off the official start of the official start next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database to plant seeds and biodiversity in the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed-map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a group of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, published in the opinion that farmers have to ensure that farmers need to improve and improve seed policies, thus ensuring a stable supply which can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report also emphasises the importance of a varied, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context, from the Luby Ossi hopes it hopes to see him soon more people.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods is particularly respected, where and how something has grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," so Luby. "we are trying to clear the people that even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian government content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August the 05.August, the Egyptian government locked the website of the Service Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network released a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian government criticised the stage for this step and promised to continue the work and effort for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Messenger for Human Rights Information remain committed in spite of this attack and the violation of Egyptian right and the Constitution in the Arab world, so it was never difficult to follow these goals, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities will be exhausted to overcome and not admit. we do it to meet our task to further meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first licensed website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities were more than two months 21 pages, as for example the independent Intelligence page, MADA Masr, arabic-language issue of Al Jazeera "for alleged involvement of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web sides. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, in addition to ANHRI's blog in Columbus, Ahmed Gamal Ziada is no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for spreading columns and articles that he has not written in Egypt any accessible web pages and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he established to circumvent the Egyptian government, was the goal of a attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with the Stadas blog is home, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013, while he took over the student population and took a video like the police of physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article are mainly turned to politics and human rights in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada stated in the rejection by the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but if the wave of blogs could not be important in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi, and even if the rejection of the blogs might not be meaningful for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It's succeeded to mediate in me the feeling of a siege artillery; an arrest, an attempted murder, incidental in the national Security Council, the blocking blogs and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have demonstrated that I wrote not for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I wish to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to the post of articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have blocked him and they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or build a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The bold are the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities open 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this was technical testing in the networks of different Internet Service Provider (ISP), among others Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE, also the blocking of providers which was possible by converting Internet access and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday the 12th of June, we noticed how the barrage of websites that offer VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to block contents and to filter access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation will assures that the interest is hit behind closed doors, thereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which they can proceed against this actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to walk with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for Day reports newspapers in Brazil with more striking cropes from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of many postcards.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old was shot in school," "Every day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "thieves smoke pharmacy with military weapons," "President Template sends 8500 troops of the Army, Marine and Air Force in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in an exhausted financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio has reached the highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian nongovernmental organisation Global Justice had called the United Nations to access the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all day and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on August 16 the editorial staff "This is not normal," in which she announced that a new section called "war in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">Motifs for their decision explained the newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crime, which happen in every large city on the world such as murder, spoil, sexual offal, etc. everything, however, will happen to the "War" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to close as a journalist not to close our eyes before grassy.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedeter, editor of Chief Editor, declared that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of the failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in all over the world with a warribrik in a country that did not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist discovered that according to information forwarded by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to showering the police, who only will shoot and ask any questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of mafia and their partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the designation "War" more than they used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist in Cecília Oliveira, arguing that violence as a "war" was declared a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult, responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown by the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, reconnaissance and historical and selfeit neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To memory: the Federal State of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," is wrong according to Cecília: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in north and northeast of the country. these are the most recent available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">No such towns is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">If we look at Mordras per state, Rio is on rank 16, "she writes.</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media group of South America, emphasised as Cecília, since years the security policy of the State is repeated.</seg>
<seg id="2781">The establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia tuficadora), one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003, belonged to one of the police unit, whose aim is to capture a Favela of police and a unit permanent there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">At the beginning, this led to a decrease of violent deaths. for a few years, UPP was supposed to protect the UPP after several reports about chikans and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to be able to protect the curious police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux made out of his article in the year 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio do not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention on behalf of the "Civil War."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war is also serious consequences for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls for the state to use means of means and paths which are typical for war. this is the entry into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and an object for "collateral damages" and "concealed balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War on or her, fact, fact that the inhabitants of the Favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police gets the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho tiomm to avenge the death of a policemen.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011, and in subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities under brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyale troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories, a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and the land, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib, currently around one million Syrians in a state of the siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">Especially strongly affected is the East Ghouta region, where an attack with chemical weapons asked life on August 21, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition derived from the basis of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacres committed by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, those of the rebels have stood on the siege of Damascus, on the siege of Damascus, causing habitants, oritioned, or through tunnels and inspection points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional food supplies such as meat become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">In contrast, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnear and perform the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the traditional, planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, they are doing an attractive food source for many residents of the East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directorate of the Project, Nabil, spoke to the French News Agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organisers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years now, this project is well-known and pressing his relief that it gains more and more "at the school."</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, use in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnear as the humanitarian Crowdfunding platform CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to the planting of mushrooms, such as Dr. Leila on Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of this article, they have achieved over 100% of its expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to pay donations to CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is focused on generators which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity of 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel scarcity, they are used locally produced plastic materials to feed the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they began production from the regions of the fungus, before they checked up their quality and they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Afterwards they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a large tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms throughout the east Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila declared that it is part of a major movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"we want to reduce the mushroom breeding of various reasons:" breach of the siege. "</seg>

<seg id="2829">He said, "We hope to spread this idea throughout the world, so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege of the siege is visible.</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires from 2017</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people attended the 21st of October in many districts of neighbouring communities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that grated in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Two and forty people died, and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October. this led the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fireplaces that spread themselves in the northern and central banks of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, in Pedrógão Grande, a similar tragedy happened where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest growth system, which monitors the forest area by satellite recordings, in 2017, about 500,000 acres of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the location: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2846">The people asked why the civilian population was not able to constrain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Innoval of the Federation of the farmers in Portugal declared the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday did it anywhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads, surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy could happen again as in June, since the streets were very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">Furthermore, construction permits in Örtites are asked with a high branch of fire.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal for the Waltribuck, which brought the government to severe fires in 2003 and 2005, was enlightened by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle for investment.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The Quercus insisted that large areas with eucalyptus trees, trees made of slightly burning wood, is like in a Teufelskreis, according to fires of this species increasingly broad.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Portugal's civil protection site visited Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when residents were sought or tried to contact their relatives, offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information provided with information: they used the own civilian data using the Application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developers João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was decisive in this fateful weekend in October so that the server pursued the onslaught of the 400,000 users that kept the fires: this website counted more than half a million.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin group, which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Just at that time Ashark Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in central ghistan, last time with his family together.</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in direction Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a few years in a coherrube. it was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took that which was left from his low wage and went to Iran. once again he was found in a foreign country together with other refugees and towed bags with mortars, the heavier than he himself had to make his living.</seg>

<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we mounted nylon in front of the open windows, so we were not refreshed at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without Papers in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">If dangerous moves on the sea, he suffered shipwrecked and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Ashark was born in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice in the day of food.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is due to relatively high growth quotas for the past asylum seekers. however, it is true also that the conditions that apply to asylum in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Commission Liberian Union for Europe writes the system "suffering under a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The large majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 "special recording centres." these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified staff and unprepared staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, Asylum may only be assigned to an admission centre if they officially have a request for asylum - which can be applied for months after registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Till then there are people who have no money for an accommodation, either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it had also Ashark.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unmistakes life helped Ashark to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After he had made several years of work in construction industry several years, Asharaf acquired its entire savings in the founding of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">It was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while still opened a second hostel.</seg>

<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Over the past few years some of Afghans created companies, including cutting shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghani restaurants were even blessed in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea to his restaurant Oriental experience in which the waiter and the kitchen staff are mostly composed of various parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menue of the restaurant tells of the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghani businessman Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Cabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome there are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs aims are enough to go far beyond the Italian gastronomic industry and retail business, and aim to the country which he had to leave (teens) than teens.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where a risk is, there are ways," says Asharaf with a smile. "I would like to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my land and I can't live happy when I know that my people suffer.</seg>
