this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him perhaps because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he imag@@ ined that the N@@ SA was illeg@@ ally heard by Americans .
but it &apos;s another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US @-@ intelligence operation in which the CIA was literally super@@ se@@ eded by the CIA in Iran .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know , who did not feel the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has been determined against rape and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , it became the symbol of the government of the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and journalists and p@@ inion journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right when media do not get this information and cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ tigen that they give .
so when the government was with R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous repor@@ ter had already done before him : he refused and said that he would prefer to go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something unusual something unusual .
suddenly , though they have been present for years , it would be indisp@@ ens@@ able for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : in the time electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ter and sources can always hide themselves less .
instead of f@@ iss@@ ors and f@@ ather@@ less , they could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators have wor@@ ried , without his understanding , wor@@ ried by his telephone numbers ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banana information , its lending service , and even travel intelligence with the list of his flights .
among this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and risk of thought to condemn .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama talked to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower in his presence , but instead the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is home too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on National Security was the outcome of that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower came to a journalist .
so we set the press work on the game that is protected by the first constitu@@ ency because the government has always more possibilities to op@@ press all out .
but as the technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can contact them from the moment , in which they contact , rather than in the neigh@@ bor , in the testimony of the testimony .
today there are communication software , which still didn &apos;t existed when editing his book , and it is much more secure than normal emails or telephone calls .
one such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source file system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet &apos;s most famous , which was developed by us today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send documents , as with any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has access to the respective News Agency .
so the government cannot do more information secretly , and many of the information they would like it would not be available from the out@@ set .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments develop new sp@@ y @-@ technologies on all over the world , who are all end@@ anger@@ ed .
it &apos;s easy to ensure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ers such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to protect mis@@ alignment . it is just important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
the about abuse during the supply of soldiers , knows and from over@@ crow@@ ded hospitals , or the next environment , the alarm to se@@ al@@ ate water from Fl@@ int . or an Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect against our all constitu@@ tional@@ ity .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the greatest data collection of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that the rich and M@@ igh@@ ty &#93; &#91; that means &#93; Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness about a explanation . &#93; this week we have been asked by messages about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama based in Panama law firm Mos@@ elle Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents provides a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers as a mos@@ h@@ um Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you do it ? &quot;
in fact , we can see the e @-@ mails , ex@@ changing messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has come back .
also there are reports that a bund@@ led of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s neu@@ tered companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a lane of 2 billion US dollars will be President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous c@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others , the nerv@@ ous waiting for the next publication , and on the next reveal documents .
now sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John Gr@@ ish@@ am novel .
it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this be ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide your assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this applies to us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these abst@@ entions are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some few are used to hide , their wealth has been discuss@@ ing and conce@@ aled -- something that we have discuss@@ ing them for ten years .
I think many people appear very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is difficult to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always present it like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one has another company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to understand , who is behind this building .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is .
I think it is interesting that there are fewer reports about this issue in the USA .
presumably , because there have been no prominent Americans in these re@@ vel@@ ations , that sc@@ and@@ al occurred .
well , it is not so that there are no rich Americans that are hidden their assets in tax ev@@ ens .
but due to the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ elle Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming , or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
indeed , in fact , it is necessary to specify less information in some US states to establish a company as a li@@ br@@ arian identity card .
this species of In@@ transparency in the United States allowed employees to zo@@ v up school children .
it does not allow operators to zo@@ oming especially vulner@@ able an@@ ks .
it is this type of behavior that concerns us all .
here we want to find out all this in practice , like all this in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent an investigation into the offices of 13 specialised firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as African minister , the susp@@ icious money into the US to buy a home , a yacht , a private jet .
we really did that all until one advoc@@ ate of our investig@@ ators make suggestions that he could transfer@@ ring his money .
these were all pre@@ ferences . none of these lawyers actually took us as a client , and of course there was no man committed to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider that this is not considered as single inci@@ dents .
it does not go about a single lawyer , who submitted to our secret investig@@ ators .
it is not about a single top pol@@ ite , wound in a sc@@ and@@ al .
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to handle this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior .
this may sound very much @-@ usual sound as if we could do anything against it , as if nothing would have changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a recovered optim@@ ist , I definitely see that a lot has started to change .
over the past few years we have seen ahead to see more transparency , regarding the owners of companies .
the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has recorded in central regi@@ sters at the national level which is really located behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the U.S. is behind .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill to the two parliamentary groups , but this does not make progress you would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama re@@ vel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the USA and globally .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ firms .
we need managers in the economy that rise and say : &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and continue to stop this type of op@@ ac@@ ity by laws .
together we can finish the In@@ transparency , which now makes this type of control cur@@ ses , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally finished .
that &apos;s the story how I close almost once and in the boot of a red Maz@@ das landed .
one day after I completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my attention .
he bought one of my art works .
he was in the city alone and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep for this day ? &quot;
he did the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
and I thought : Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just knew it only ! he says he would go to the pe@@ ac@@ cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the luggage boot of a Maz@@ das !
that &apos;s a small boot space !
then I heard : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said : &quot; demon@@ ic , how ? &quot;
in the night I was in bed , I star@@ red to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken there ?
a wild sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got a fear that I went out of bed to the door and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he bought from me today is based in his class@@ room . he is a teacher now .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my eye @-@ angle .
perhaps people who were sold in childhood as strangers have been sold , really friends who were only waiting for them to be discovered ?
it was normal for me on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
make a time leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my fellow worker attracts and the rent is increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I think that creativity can make it anxi@@ ety in fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new fellow Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I could over@@ lay something like we could earn something . our apartment is on a designer bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including one mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created the &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress in wood floors .
they loved it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure to taste our cheese ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ et completely different because we made them for our guests .
we t@@ oured with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest , and the door to the castle , Brian and I fell .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent ?
things came to Roll .
my former fellow inhabitants , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ c@@ zy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept .
so we presented the Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website dedicated to the people publicly pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , their doors are closed when visiting .
you can then invite you to the Internet via the internet to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the miss@@ ile would ign@@ ited .
but she did not .
no one , who is yet full of comfort , would invest in a business , not allowed to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all learned , strangers have been dangerous .
once you have a problem , you get to the things you can well . we were able to design them .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we had learned that design is much more than just the appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design work so something ?
is it possible to create design confidence ?
I want to give you a sample , which de@@ grade would give to us .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will take you out of your instrument .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ lock mobile phone your left seat .
this quiet An@@ cor@@ ing of pan@@ ic , which you will feel right -- -- is exactly what you will feel when the first time open the door .
for the only thing is personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone a fore@@ igner in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so the most guests feel when they can stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
but , who now has Al Go@@ res mobile now ?
could you declare on Twitter , that it di@@ pped for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
now you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what would be if we have changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor first appeared with his name , if he would have told you how his dog or his children will be called ?
imagine , you would have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you want to cancel your mobile phone ?
for a well @-@ covered feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to compare negative ass@@ ess@@ ments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest their ass@@ ess@@ ments before we issued it online .
last week we discovered something new .
we performed with Stan@@ ford a study . we investigated how probably it is that people have confidence in each other , depending on how they are similar to age and residence .
little sur@@ pris@@ ingly , we trust the people most , that are most similar .
the more differences we find the less trusted we .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changed .
a good reputation with simil@@ ar@@ ities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep ro@@ oting times .
Moreover , we drove that confidence is dependent on how much you get from there .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you &apos;re telling too little , for example , &quot; Hi ! &quot; , you will get no answer .
how much tells you how much : &quot; I have trouble with my mother &quot; -- -- will the request not be accepted .
so there is an optimal degree to op@@ enn@@ ess , such as &quot; T@@ olle works of art in your apartment ! I will make my family holiday . &quot;
how to create it with design , create this level ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips to which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages against strangers .
what we did not expect , was the great amount of people who were more than ready to submit these supplies .
here you can see how many people are entitled to claim our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably a lot of luck .
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been bred before .
for us the business is just very good .
of course there are times when it is not smooth running .
there were guests who celebrated un@@ lawful parties or houses devast@@ ated .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing p@@ lim@@ mer@@ it than these calls . it is already hurt when I think of it only .
the dis@@ appointment that list@@ ens to the voice of the call@@ ers , and will always be our greatest motivation to help us further .
fortunately , of the 123 million overnight stays , only one fra@@ ction had a problem .
for people treated one another .
if it works , Wonder@@ ful can be created .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay and he suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts drove him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his evaluation :
&quot; perfect house for travelers that tend to heart attack due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real protection hed@@ geho@@ gs that save life , although they don &apos;t know it really .
you drive one in your own car in the hospital if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring them books .
they can stay even longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course not running every stay .
but these relations behind the pure cash transaction is exactly what you want to reach with Share Economy .
when I was very proud of this concept for the first time , I asked :
how does the idea of part with money transactions coming together ?
it &apos;s been here about a economic trade .
but now just &quot; home &quot; to be known , the thing is not just .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of itself , and that changes everything .
when one travels today , this is to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would be when travelling to a rich buffet from local st@@ ew@@ es ?
what would be , if you visited to wait a group there , a group there would be a thoroughly ref@@ ill and a quarter of a K@@ nei@@ ge &apos;s quarter , of which you have never heard ;
or if you could learn to cook a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to principle of privacy .
what would be when we would like to create apartments from the ground ?
what would that look like ?
what would happen if cities would accept the thoughts of a common share ?
I present yourself cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and am@@ ort@@ ation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project had already begun . many parking places who belonged to the government ,
now people were offered to residents . students who were looking for a lead ?
they were medi@@ ated by people whose children were going out . they were incub@@ ator @-@ programmes ,
in order to finance the new start @-@ ups in share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries are going to be guest at a fore@@ igner or a host .
so the idea seemed to be so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
but there was hospitality already before .
there were already similar websites in front of us .
so why has just our works ?
apart from Happ@@ iness and Tim@@ ing , we thought that you can find the correct design with the resources of confidence .
design can help us to overcome our deep roots .
I find that amazing ,
to be overwhelming .
I have to think about it if a red Maz@@ da goes on to me .
of course we know that design can &apos;t solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we will be able to help you soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a faithful ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , under@@ ne@@ ath the brain under@@ wear , a m@@ ist ?
or quite simply a delay on security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the fault for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most of those who would not know Muslims .
presumably people don &apos;t talk with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslims : it &apos;s great , you know .
I say to you who I am .
I &apos;m a mother , a coffee @-@ operated -- double es@@ presso , with whi@@ pped cream extra .
I am being mistaken ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ ing @-@ Fitness fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I &apos;m a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslims .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to op@@ t it .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ sted me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslims . I decided to bear my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you pressing yourself ? &quot;
the les@@ see was at that time , it was a femin@@ ist independence of independence , namely to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt it to a perfect and in@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only passed the faith of my parents .
I have to know with the we@@ an .
I read it , thought after , exhibited in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and lon@@ ely dedication to commit himself with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm g@@ athers me sometimes to the crying .
I know it myself . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever feeling the feeling that someone does not perc@@ eive you completely , and somehow he loves ?
so it feels like .
later I got married and started , as all the good Egyptian , my career in engineering .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then the terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you remember probably exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , I had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ ary . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ crafts in buildings , people mo@@ cked out of the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting ?
my shock got turned into indig@@ nation quickly .
why should one do so anything ?
I changed to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terror ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ hadi@@ st ... &quot; , ... &quot; Ji@@ hadi@@ st ... &quot; ... &quot; m@@ ashed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only that of my country , but in the N@@ u rel@@ ayed me the works of others from one citizen in a susp@@ ects .
on that same day , we had to travel through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I drove me -- as we were silent - so deep it went to my seat , and I feared the first time than Muslims were recognized .
we moved to our apartment in this night in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ly , &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; be careful in good illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; meetings led you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then , it was Friday in that week -- the day to gather for Muslims .
and again the war@@ nings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings of feelings were un@@ fortun@@ ate and I heard of attacks on Muslims , or of men who stayed for Muslims in the Free and struck .
there were really bran@@ than@@ ation on Mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something was not felt right .
because people who had attacked this land have attacked our land .
I have swe@@ pt the rage of people upon the terror@@ ists .
imagine that ! I was also mad .
it is not easy to use itself .
I have no questions about questions , I love questions .
the alleg@@ ations which are hard .
nowadays , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to connect Muslims and Mos@@ ques .
they speak of my congregation as of a tumor in the US .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or gro@@ ove ?
they know : one mal@@ icious tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour one keeps only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are Muslims , like all other Americans , no tum@@ ours in the body of the US , but an essential organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , nar@@ rator and Olympi@@ oni@@ ds .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make a saf@@ er place ?
it may be free to hold a few parking but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque causes to consider people other faith toler@@ ant , and greater citizen participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington State area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in Mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ alised in their cellar or bed in front of one computer .
at the radic@@ alised process , it has found that it is online . as the first , the person is cut off from their family , so that the people may believe that the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior , and their ide@@ ology , is a reven@@ ger or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim Islam : Islam is a violent religion .
last@@ ly , a group like the IS had its brut@@ ality with the Quran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would like to add to their pre@@ ferences if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion faithful .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
but when looking for a look at them , they do not drives what they are in their Holy Scrip@@ tures .
it is their brut@@ ality , which they read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding im@@ am told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because they pre pre to join the IS .
I was surprised and asked him whether they have been in touch with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke , she brought them to silence , and told her that her wrath was to bring her mind for the in@@ justice in the world , they only would be in trouble .
from nothing to insp@@ ires and something that had been a sense of her rage , she was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization through extrem@@ ists who spoke in a solution .
this Im@@ am turned the connection to God and its church again .
instead of acc@@ use for their rage , he showed their constru@@ ctive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , it kept her to join the IS .
that was an insight , like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it work on normal Americans ?
how does it work on every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of anxi@@ ety every day to our democracy , to freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear us , happen at least three things .
we do rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and advantages .
a study shows : when people did news , in which negative about Muslims has been reported , they would have more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look when the m@@ oods were contrary to Muslims at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the ahead of the war war and during two elec@@ toral periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction on Muslim terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mining the foundation of a free society that has sen@@ sible and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is an early warning sign .
maybe it might feel first , but the toxic air of fear would send us all .
in the assignment of collectors , it is not just about to explain to himself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was talented to dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he knew the most common , the most common man , whom they knew .
she visited him there , and he showed her his CV . she was ast@@ oun@@ ding and said :
&quot; when is this of my breasts such a young man become a young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit to Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , she was murdered , the same as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . he did it in their apartment , as in a execution after he post@@ pon@@ ds against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he fired eight times on De@@ ah .
Fan@@ at@@ ism cannot only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
we consider it and for us it was no easy decision , because it went to us to leave our children in America : one that would control us through anxi@@ ety , or one in whom we can exercise our religion .
we decided to see the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove in silence to the mosque .
I took him out , I drew off my shoes , went into the building hall , and what I saw that I kept .
the hall was completely drunk .
then , the Im@@ am announced an announcement , than@@ ked , and called our guests welcome , because the half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ eist@@ s , believers and non @-@ cred@@ itors who came to attack us , but to bite .
in this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there , because they had courage and jud@@ ging pan@@ ic and pre@@ f@@ ences .
what do you choose ?
what are you interested in the moment of anxi@@ ety and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
are you going to go on number ?
or you will join them that mean : we are better than those that are .
thank you .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a Ner@@ v .
but I ask myself , what you might say that you are talking about a t@@ ED@@ talk , a monument with deep @-@ pass , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t know . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I &apos;m so usually like it is allowed .
when people look to Muslims in all over the world , and I did that with the biggest carried out study on Muslims in all over the world , people want to normal human things .
they want prosper@@ ity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am no exception in all resp@@ ects .
if people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for bast@@ ler , it is short to become one billion business .
monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before air@@ p@@ act enters our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flight machines at Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with lines .
by connecting the passengers achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build self @-@ free structures .
you have learned to bear loads , to deal with tur@@ bul@@ ence and to react to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility of possible in the autonomous flight .
in order to work an autonomous system , we need to know collec@@ tively collec@@ tively , where the mobile objects are located in the area .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that &apos;s possible to focus on the rapid development of dynamic growth .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new location technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room where the machine should do .
external commands are in the highest image . &quot; such as &quot; start &quot; and &quot; landing . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern starter ,
a flight unit , that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most of the star@@ ters , it can h@@ over , and has great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a swe@@ eping side .
a limitation of hed@@ ge@@ cut@@ ters is that they react sensiti@@ vely to tur@@ bul@@ ence such as wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight is no matter what the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved thanks to practice .
okay .
during our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions leading to the core of the cause .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such question .
helicop@@ ters are known for example as machines with a thousand movable parts that were amm@@ ate to viol@@ ate you .
four decades ago , the trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled flight devices that had only two moving parts : one propeller and a stern th@@ ru@@ der .
it has been un@@ discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically sim@@ pl@@ est remote control unit . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , one propeller ,
no cl@@ apping , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse , no further positions or controllers , only one propeller .
although it &apos;s mechanically sim@@ ulations , happen in the interior very much , so it can fly stable and can move in the room .
nevertheless , it doesn &apos;t have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to bring it to fly , I need to throw it pretty right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood , if all look on , is small , therefore , I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed in the evening .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in gen@@ ome , this machine is here , the om@@ ni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , a exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is not balanced .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his orientation .
he will receive the ut@@ most ordinary ability of God ,
moving into space in all directions , no matter what directions is turned or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is adjustable in models , the rest is taught directly at flies .
let &apos;s see that .
if passengers should have part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin propeller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other against the counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when they build it together , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , a little bit wrong - a motor or propeller falls off , the electronics or a battery - can fly the machine further , even if restricted .
we will demonstrate that , having a half of air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration was examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a wide range of aesthetic expression .
we performed standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter - each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with local technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where the room is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully , encourage this demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would like to do a flying lamp screen on Broadway .
of course , it is hard to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the salary is in the development and creative act .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , wise s@@ ni@@ ps allowed to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive professional and economic potential , the t@@ ittle on the i .
thank you .
about 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far distant galax@@ y is getting faster , they turned so the mass of three uns in pure energy in a pure energy .
this short moment it sh@@ ined brigh@@ ter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big Kn@@ all .
they cannot put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ ge@@ aring itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
then we arrange events at first time .
at 1.3 billion years ago , multi@@ zel@@ li@@ ges was formed on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God arise for us - even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of extra Mu@@ ch@@ -- R@@ ai Weiss recently decided by MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise about Colom@@ bian black holes .
most of them stayed for crazy .
but enough people know them as a mad man , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation sponsored their idea .
after decades of development , design , concept and extremely hard @-@ hard work they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ ob@@ servatory .
in the following period , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O was significantly increased significantly , giving the detection of enorm@@ ously enorm@@ ously improved .
it is therefore called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 , L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a final test run , some smaller , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves prop@@ elled the two col@@ li@@ ating black holes through the Earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : just two moments in my life were emotional than that :
the birth of my daughter
and the goo@@ db@@ ye to my dad &apos;s father .
basically , it was the fruits of my life .
all this , what I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physics at the MIT . he has been investigated for 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves like L@@ IG@@ O meas@@ ur@@ able signals . but what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a ru@@ ction in the h@@ ubs of room and time .
when passing the wave , the space and its entire content can be stretched to one direction and stretched out into the other side .
in the illustration of illustr@@ ative theory , Do@@ z@@ ard often lead to rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often a right al@@ ber@@ ing dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , expand and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched by us during the meeting of the waves , the expansion of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means that 20 zer@@ os after the compass , followed by a 1 . therefore , the L@@ IG@@ O workers explained to be crazy .
using a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already ab@@ sur@@ d , it would have to be less than a centi@@ meter of the radius of a nuclear @-@ core . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text on grav@@ itation
described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for waves like this : &quot; the technical difficulties of construction of such detectors are massive .
but physi@@ cists are final and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims that L@@ IG@@ O would be more an ear than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than the things around us : expres@@ sions , the size of your mobile phones .
that &apos;s quite practical . for example , you can custom@@ ize a picture or a map of things by taking off the coming light around you .
with sounds is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres .
that &apos;s why it is very hard , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you very much :
the face of your child .
instead , we listen to specific properties like sound layer and -@@ height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now Alice says now . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; g@@ rief Bob . &quot;
the same is gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can not make any simple images of objects in all .
but by changing the changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for L@@ IG@@ O the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
if we convert wave pattern to sound , we can listen to all literally .
gravity , the grav@@ itation allows us to betra@@ y about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my collector Scott is already busy .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , zir@@ cons simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two body very quickly , just stop the same Zir@@ pen with an additional sound change . that sounds like to : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of movement sp@@ elling , expressed in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that I never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &#91; Ger@@ ch &#93; Every one knows what he must hear , recognize this as a sound by -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 times of sun@@ shine as quickly as the st@@ aves of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : we are superior to us what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 grass , the other with a mass of 36 bul@@ es , revol@@ ve one hundred times a second before they colon@@ ise .
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we have heard it .
it is the lasting importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O shows a completely new way to expl@@ oring the universe as they never before was possible .
on this path we can listen to the All and invisible .
much in all , we can practice -- practically or basically -- .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to explo@@ de why a high quality stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . of them we have learned much about the all .
the exciting physical int@@ ages are done , but at the core which lies behind thousands of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see , since these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rating iron , than if it would be transparent glass . I &apos;d love to explore the first minutes of the universe - but we will never see it because the ur@@ cr@@ ust covers his own re@@ ins .
by means of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back at the beginning .
and that &apos;s most important : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen that we will never see , and from which we don &apos;t have any idea . things we can only discover by listening .
indeed , L@@ IG@@ O was in the first attempt of things that we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says this topic : me : the kind of stars , the black holes are observed , like L@@ IG@@ O them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak for our ar@@ che@@ ological work .
L@@ IG@@ O enables us to view a completely different viewing angle at all , in the development of the stars and ultimately how we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be , as cour@@ age@@ ous as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great detectors and the noise and the tracks of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ servat@@ ories -- a whole new generation of ob@@ servat@@ ories on earth and in all .
for what could be beautiful than the ur@@ cr@@ ust itself ?
now it is time of great dreams .
do you agree with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
for one year I would be too all &quot; Yes ! &quot; I feared that I feared me .
no matter whether it took me nerv@@ ous , I brought me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes &quot; .
wanted I to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted I to start playing the game ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : exactly that , what I feared , I feared my fear .
fear to keep spe@@ ech@@ es , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the Power of One word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes that changed my life to something unexpected . it started with a question of my little .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for all &quot; estim@@ ations , &quot;
when she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estim@@ ation , I need milk for my g@@ um@@ bil@@ ical ver . &quot;
she asked them once , if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude of life in my family . from there I swe@@ ars to play always with them as soon as you do , or whi@@ ther I go , I say always Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has an ast@@ oun@@ ding tri@@ bution . only recently , I guess that &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am familiar . I think things , raised up the life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create TV . I make TV .
I &apos;m doing TV , in large style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carry out 70 hours of program into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are at the same time .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that previously existed .
the budget for an episode of a television channel can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days , four shows , thus all nine days 20 Million Dollar TV , four broad@@ casts , the same time in production , four episodes : Sc@@ and@@ al , 15 episodes : Sc@@ and@@ al , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Coun@@ sel , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 Hours Television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my television series will run on Thursday evening on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is globally , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are ship@@ ments that I have created himself , and not only produced , so still remain clean . I have to find time , truly quiet , creative time to watch my fans and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that are round around the world .
do you know who still does it ?
no one , that &apos;s why I am a titanium .
dream job .
I do not want to im@@ press you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you all of you that are so hard working , whether you have a company , a business or a budget , do you understand that I don &apos;t just tell your computer , and it &apos;s right when I say : I understand that there is not a dream job in dream .
it is all a job , everything work , all reality , all the blood , all silence - no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m getting deeper into the job , there is no other feeling .
my work creates a country from nothing .
when I was up , I found it when I painted on a canvas .
that &apos;s how dre@@ aming about a high tone , lie@@ ve a marathon .
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that is at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ uous , nau@@ gh@@ ty , and matern@@ al , cru@@ el@@ ly and reasonable . and the best to it is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when working is well running .
a Sum@@ mer@@ ry begins in my head , and it grows and growing , and the sum@@ s sounds like an animated street , I could always go on it for ever .
many people assume , if I declare to them the sum@@ s that I think the writing is dressed for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- as I began to work with the TV production began to work and work , to create and work , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s are more than the writing .
the sum of the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum of the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s are God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t stri@@ ve any other than in size .
the feeling , not different to stri@@ ve , no matter what price does .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means an workflow .
perhaps it means gen@@ ius .
perhaps it &apos;s E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I did not make for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just said to you , I am a titanium , and I know that I want to ask it in question .
to make a clear : ever more more shows , the more episodes , the more more episodes , the more works there , the more things see me , the more things I write on history , the more expectations there are more expectations .
the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work me .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the linen , the great sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I &apos;m the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then stopped the sum@@ s .
revised , over@@ loaded , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the sum@@ s stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their m@@ om is a single job title .
Har@@ per tells us : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estimates , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot;
there are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I loved my work no more . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not return .
my sum@@ s were broken .
I did the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 @-@ day @-@ days , lab@@ eled weekends , no Reu@@ ter , but not deleg@@ ate , one Titan sleeps not , with all your heart , clear eyes what also always .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a preview of Titan ,
everything was gray , I didn &apos;t have fun any more .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so what do you do if that &apos;s what you do , the work that you love , have suddenly mis@@ ed ?
I know , some may think : &quot; h@@ ay you , the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know , you can do if you are doing , man loves to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves another , and that &apos;s the sum@@ s when you stop the sum@@ s when the sum@@ s stops when the sum@@ s stops , who is then ?
what are you like ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart can I survive , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; Southern States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; presented me a question .
I &apos;m on the way to her late and she says : &quot; m@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I will already say no , when two things are aware of :
first , I have to say Yes to everything and second , she called me not &quot; estimates . &quot;
they call no more &quot; estim@@ ations . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I hate it if I am Titan I and my sum@@ s , and this changes everything before my own eyes .
and this she says , &quot; m@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and their sisters with it , we laugh much and I read very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum@@ s , I can &apos;t do anything else .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the great sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything exists , st@@ icky finger and mo@@ ist kiss@@ es , tender voices , wax pins and the song , in which it goes well , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
an incre@@ mental door goes to and another energy club comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it &apos;s something that we forgot .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , the titanium , that is just the replacement .
if I ask you , who are you if I am when I &apos;m using my brain through broad@@ casts and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum of the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum of the sum@@ s is the river which comes from the living .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s are igno@@ red the print of history , to do the tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps fl@@ atten@@ ed me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I usually make sure that I can deliver me as an workflow of any gu@@ ilt .
it &apos;s the law I have no choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it was so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
to play , don &apos;t really want to work as we work .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer my workplace as the home .
this thing conf@@ ession is painful , because what a person is better to be able to be home ?
well , I am .
hon@@ est , I call myself &quot; Titan &apos;s --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too cold , none of them .
we r@@ ush@@ es around the garden , and back , and back .
we make small dance @-@ parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we dis@@ bur@@ sted soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mainly sti@@ ff@@ ly , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always g@@ onna start to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how one lives , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why did we ever listen to playing ?
you can also say ! do they say then Yes , if your child want to play with you .
perhaps you keep me for n@@ ai@@ v , a day event .
there you probably be right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they get rid of them something else .
we are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes you will replace a Mari@@ enk@@ ae@@ fer or bis@@ cuit .
and my Teen@@ ie daughter has 15 minutes long with me , I am Mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more need not need .
everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad @-@ mood !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no deposit steering .
the day is short : dinner , the children beg@@ ged .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my well@@ being , my world . they do not have the children to feel the sum@@ s to feel a place for his soul peace .
it does not play with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play &quot; games &quot; in general .
take the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out it and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect there . I will fail and I will win . friends meeting books , books , the day enjoy --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; it &apos;s short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got my first TV show when I wanted to go more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not going for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my leisure time . the sum@@ s seem to return , when I &apos;m not working .
work not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens up , and I find myself in my office . I list@@ ened to new ideas . that sum@@ s lead me to new ideas . I use it into full bre@@ eders and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s that bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
bubble ins@@ ist and st@@ icky fingers , dinner with friends .
now that is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of the work is part of me , but just a part . and therefore I am so grat@@ eful .
it &apos;s me to me that I am a titanium . I never saw a Titan who plays to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to more games .
and yet , I have everything in the handle . my brain is even functional . my bon@@ fires are even burning .
the more I play , the more happy are I and my children .
the more I play , the more feel good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land which I run , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the mar@@ gins , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s that sum@@ s the right sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , troubled , naked and new life in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things I think you raised to life .
this belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and play more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedy .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgery , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury to the central nerv@@ ous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerv@@ ous functions through different surgical actions .
they also have one of the best known ones , the &quot; low @-@ accum@@ ulation , &quot; which im@@ planted the electro@@ de deep in the brain , in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons that improves neu@@ rolo@@ gic function .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s dest@@ itute , having stayed under heavy trem@@ bling and heavy pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
we wish to approach this dream to us .
I want to show you that we are very close together .
some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was leading medical doctor and worked in the emergency exit day and night .
I often supplied patients with cran@@ ial brain trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that at skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a must be til@@ ted the brain and the brain sc@@ ull is til@@ ted .
to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
for this purpose I have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain balance .
rather than to throw the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
the cells are grown from a tissue , similar to small children that will be taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and environments to flour@@ ish .
it was just that we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as such as a stem cell culture . with big green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you may know from the bi@@ ology lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe , that can turn into every cell type of the organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small grove of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OR .
we made a fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were changed differently .
they were slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but it beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand from whence they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called the Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have it in our brain .
they make up 4 % of the cer@@ eb@@ ral cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they get us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injury .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain in the non @-@ language area and then the cells are just as cul@@ tured as it did Jean @-@ François .
and they are then marked in colour to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the outlet of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ plant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we im@@ plant@@ ing the same cells in the dig@@ n@@ ate brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were working with monkey .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they had been taken away after several weeks , they would have been taken back home . the room is already busy , they are not needed , so van@@ ish them .
in the second scenario we added a violation of and im@@ planted the same cells , and now the cells remained , and they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the proof of these are these small points . these are the cells that we in vitro in the culture .
we couldn &apos;t stop this here .
do these cells also help a monkey , to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take feeding pellets with a tablet .
they did it very good .
when they achieved a stable skill level , we last in the motor Cor@@ tex of the manual Cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic bra@@ ins . they recover to a certain degree , just like the ap@@ es .
when we were sure the monkey achieved his degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand they see the monkey , who recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its initial performance before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
watch now , when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the im@@ plantation .
I can say you , that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found much more about these cells .
we can then freeze and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Park@@ inson &apos;s .
but our dream is still , to im@@ plant it with people .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know anyone who can need . &quot;
I definitely be sure .
of course , the question of what is the greatest obstacles before you can start clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the largest obstacles are the authorities . starting from this great results you have to fill about two kilogram papers and forms to pass these kind of studies .
BG : that &apos;s under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to receive permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to see in the future , how many years it will take until someone can come into the hospital , and this therapy is available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will we allow the authority to launch it soon ?
then we have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centr@@ alized study .
one must really refer to that it is useful before being able to offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is certainly , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us of it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we are doing a big mistake to view it as a matter of course .
we see the democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as un@@ changeable haz@@ ard .
we believe that capitalism is forced to democracy .
that is not right .
Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Peking as@@ dou@@ bt@@ edly proved that it is possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy in Europe dis@@ appears .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- became un@@ am@@ big@@ uous as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group - un@@ am@@ big@@ uous that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- does not influence the savings programmes that were implemented in Greece .
in this moment I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China that repeatedly said that the democracy would be abolished if they would change anything .
in this place I would like to present a economic model for real democracy .
I pray you , together with me to believe that Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of error , we could save the democracy , but that we need a real and def@@ ensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies will fo@@ ster our future dark and spectacular , new technologies .
on this topic , I would like to refer to an interesting contra@@ diction which currently threat@@ ens our business .
I call the &quot; Gem@@ s Summit @-@ Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; .
one summit is known to you . you know and acknow@@ ledge him as the Scho@@ den@@ berg that th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Scho@@ ol@@ berg ,
but few recognize his Di@@ d@@ ym@@ us .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the se@@ eable as@@ par@@ agus and corpor@@ ations , which could be investing in it , where it would be productive and income , with which one could produce the debt relief and even all the things could be ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the last 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars have been invested in all the prosper@@ ity of goods , such as industrial equipment , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , and so on and so on .
$ 3.4 trillion , after lots of money , it is compens@@ ated for a lot of money until it is equivalent to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock ex@@ ams and inst@@ al@@ inate real estate prices .
thus , debts and non @-@ productive capital are facing the twin summit which did not trigger the normal market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which could not implement the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which could not be investing in which they could kill him . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , who would kill him that his son would kill him when he is growing ,
un@@ trimm@@ ed the circumstances that lead to it , that the ov@@ arian are k@@ ills him .
this is my Ha@@ des with capitalism --
its extremely precious item . all the in@@ productive capital should be used to develop our lives , developing the human talents and particularly to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to rescue the Earth .
is Democracy The Solution ?
I think . but before we proceed : what do we understand among democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as a company form , to control the open and the poor as a majority the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy decided to naturally many of --
of course , women , foreigners , and natural slaves .
however , it would be an error to reduce the job value of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy in due to these incl@@ usions .
the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they gave the work to the working arms , but not only the right to free expression of opinion , but important and decisive , which gives them the right to political participation with the same mood bal@@ ancing in questions of the State Ballet .
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy took not long as long --
like a candle that illumin@@ ates very light , it is also hat@@ ched out quickly .
however , our current liberal democracy found their roots not in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the processed arms , the liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for ruling nations .
for the liberal democracy only emerged when a complete separation of politics and economy would be possible , while the democratic process became acc@@ lim@@ it@@ ated while the economy - so the world of the corpor@@ ations -- a demo@@ c@@ rati@@ e@@ Free Zone .
in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since that date , in which the separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ati@@ al struggle between the two instead , by the economy gradually emig@@ rants and law@@ ns them .
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians are no longer like that ?
it is not located on an Deg@@ ener@@ ation of its DNA .
it lies in it that one can be nowadays in the government , but still not in power because power from politics into the economy is pre@@ occupied and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my Ha@@ des with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of noise , which so lasting the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are hungry at the end of this year .
similarly , it is similarly to the economy , which has led politics as far as a self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of the corpor@@ ations grows , political goods are rising , the economic demand is falling and the managing director of the corpor@@ ations are to be severely pain@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies .
according to the success of capitalism , &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher will become the twin vision , and the greater the waste of human labor power and the fact of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and economy again , and it would be better when the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; ret@@ ains control , as in the ancient of Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea for this .
the Marx@@ ist Lin@@ ke had this idea about 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t especially good .
the doctrine from the Soviet Union should be that the working arms should recover only by a wonder a position as in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of breeding and waste .
but there is a solution : to create the processed arms !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low wage by automation and robots .
the problem is that as long as economy and politics are separated , the automation will be higher , the waste , and social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China is coming .
so we must re@@ design the economy and again un@@ ite the economy and politics , and make sure that we can democr@@ atically elected the restored area of surveillance , otherwise we are able to show the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary .
so the question is not whether capitalism showed up the technical achievements which he has caused to survive .
the most interesting question is whether the capitalism is similar to &quot; matrix , similar to those of &quot; Star Trek , &quot; which is similar to humans and people in the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long convers@@ ations the sense of life .
I believe we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; @-@ like Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; like d@@ yst@@ opia ?
in the practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples .
in the field of companies : ask yourself a capital market , where you have earned money , while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a workplace to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is ownership of those currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and proceeds from revenue and the concept of wage work is completely overhau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but people who are not working there , and employees who do not belong there . no Di@@ ving more between capital and work , no large g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ ars , and finally no outstanding tw@@ ins peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please explain that our national currencies have a free fluctu@@ ation rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade will be tra@@ ded in this currency - we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and every government paying the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading platform of the respective country , in a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world where investment means are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that one was not the technical resources then .
today we have them , especially in front of a restored policies and economy .
the world , whom I choose to you , is liber@@ ally liberal , in which they privileged individuals pre@@ fers and mar@@ x@@ ist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ an .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
are we w@@ aking up in such a world
or are we going to fall into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ opia ?
the answer depends on how we decide ourselves together .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you defend yourself as liberal Marx@@ ists yourself in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything from what I have just said is that Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and business is ... do we do that , technological development will create a so massive decline in overall economic demand , which Larry sum@@ mers called &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only be our democracy , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small .
if this analysis is applicable , Marx is absolutely relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely conf@@ using .
BG : indeed , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not conf@@ used , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophy -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who mentioned this . BG : in your lecture they mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner you have very clear what you hold on the view of the West to China .
do you want to repeat this here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracy we have the note of a democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited the democracy to politics , while the area where the most of the economy , -- the sector of economy -- a totally demo@@ cra@@ y@@ free zone .
in certain resp@@ ects , if I may say that so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to China today &apos;s England 19th century .
for -- Do you remember - we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historical .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
it was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical that affects the democratic development .
what is happening in China now is similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
China now refuse to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , sm@@ ells amazing after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners were curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal sight , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the chance to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goo@@ db@@ ye to compl@@ ying , and the debt relief measures that a massive refin@@ ing line was threatened by the euro zone and continues to be massi@@ vely at the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek pre@@ m@@ ings -- the way , the first suggest@@ ion was to reveal this den@@ ial --
unfortunately , it was right to do . unfortunately , the powers in the euro zone , elected within the European group , still ref@@ usal .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get an economic system that is not over@@ vi@@ able , due to political will and auth@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , it may be delayed a while , but if the change happens , it has ab@@ rupt@@ ly ab@@ rupt@@ ly and de@@ struc@@ tive .
BG : which changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future when we do not change its structure .
BG : do you have any error in your time as finance ministers ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister , who , after 6 months in office , claims particularly in a cl@@ amped situation , he did not have any mist@@ akes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mist@@ akes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the request for pro@@ long@@ ation of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ our@@ able interest on pages of the wal@@ ker , to find a common solution .
but this was not .
they wanted only to bring our government to fall , just because they were not going to negoti@@ ate with the euro zone by the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to pass a cat@@ astroph@@ ic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika &apos;s Tro@@ ika , who has imposed this policy , was : &quot; that was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all the , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you still seem to be quite per @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone , from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if she did not survive , the released flip @-@ forces will be di@@ abo@@ lically and the European Union are destro@@ ying .
that will not be cat@@ astroph@@ ic in Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we propose the way to a post @-@ trial in 1930 , after that it appears to me , it will also be able to be able to be the future of the Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you &apos;re wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you so that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy Price ever heard of the majority , though he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably for 22 very enter@@ taining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision , the Roy had met three years ago .
Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has a I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes in Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing the shows and content that will produce the Amazon .
of course , that is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy do not have to select either .
he has to find shows that are very very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are quite right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series at the IM@@ DB website . its evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are preserved .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
that shows shows how &quot; Break@@ ing Bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after you saw a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of Show .
on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as , &quot; -- which should tell you what at the end of the curve .
Roy Price does not respond to the left side of the curve , because I think you &apos;re already specific intelligence , to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle school , average TV -- shows , which are neither good or bad , they will be inspir@@ ing .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the print is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon wants to do something that Amazon wants to risk nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he keeps a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and elec@@ ts eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and displays them online , where they can watch one for free .
and if Amazon gives out free things , you get too , right ?
millions of spectators watching this episodes .
however , they do not know that they will be seen when watching this shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team to record everything .
they capture when you start the show when you wake up , what parts you want to ski@@ p or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide to decide which show they should produce them .
in fact they gather the data , process , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can U.S. trans@@ formers . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of them can remember this show , because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it &apos;s only an average show - in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve represents 7.4 , and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- therefore something above average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time with another company , another manager has a top @-@ show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is always on search to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but it does something different .
instead of st@@ aff@@ ing a contest , he and his team have seen the existing data about Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give to the shows , whose shows they like etc .
then use these data to find out these small details about the audience : which shows they like what producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went with a venture , and decided to do not a Sit@@ com via four trans@@ formers , but a drama series about a Senator to make .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
the House of Cards &quot; receives a 9.1 Review on this bend . so exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
one has two very competent , data experienced companies .
they connect these many data together and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
why is this ?
because the logic happens somehow that it should work with everything .
if one collec@@ ts millions of data , for a decision to meet you , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years to statistics as back @-@ up .
one optimized it through very powerful computer .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , or ?
if data analysis is not working , this is something terri@@ fying , because we are living in a time , in which we are more and more statistics , to hit serious decisions so far beyond the TV .
does anyone knows the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
none . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in contact with this software in contact with this software . come in contact with this software .
if anyone is in the U.S. in the prison and asked for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is made or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad it is decided whether a person is good or bad .
medi@@ oc@@ re television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there are evidence that these data analysis , despite the many specifications ,
not always the best results . this is not that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems did not know how to use data .
the data in the most important companies are also false .
yes , even Google makes mist@@ akes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is possible to predi@@ ct the loss of data analysis by the flu , the worse way - by data analysis of the Google search .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news of news . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a release in the journal Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it didn &apos;t work , that was again a sensation when the rest@@ art of the publication in the journal Nature &quot; published in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google do sometimes understand something .
despite all of these errors caused by the decisions of life a -- at the workplace , at the legal rule , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized genet@@ ics -- an area where some very smart people can ut@@ ili@@ ze many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer treatment
or the development of an medic@@ ament . over the years I detected some pattern on the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions . the samples should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
as a first @-@ to @-@ place this problem in its individual parts , so that you can analyse the single parts ; as a second set the single parts again put together to set a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : to be taken apart and again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help load a problem and understand his parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that is good for the brain , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , then , if the information is not complete , especially if it &apos;s the brain &apos;s brain .
therefore , I think that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
they use data to understand how to understand the audience what else they would not have been able to put together . but the decision to assemble all those parts again , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which doesn &apos;t stand in data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered into a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they played TV ideas , then chose the Alpha House as the show .
it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; they say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things are wrong , when data begin to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool , and to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will become ...
before it was data , it was the decision for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions with a j@@ a- or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely , &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will later interpre@@ t it later with a technique coding .
so far , I met some decisions made in my life , where I should listen to the ball in the afternoon .
but , as you know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much , as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball tou@@ ches and cle@@ ver and smart . finally , it &apos;s right to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel very encour@@ aging message , that in spite of the great amount of data always paid out to make decisions to make an expert in what you do , and risks involved .
because at the end , there are not data , but the risks associated with which you end up at the end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
