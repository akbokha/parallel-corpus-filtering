<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him perhaps because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he imagined that the NSA was illegally heard by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it's another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US-intelligence operation in which the CIA was literally superseeded by the CIA in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know, who did not feel the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been determined against rape and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, it became the symbol of the government of the government, Whistleblower and journalists and pinion journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media do not get this information and cannot protect the identity of the Mutigen that they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government was with Risen, he did something that many courageous reporter had already done before him: he refused and said that he would prefer to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something unusual something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, though they have been present for years, it would be indispensable for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time electronic monitoring, the reporter and sources can always hide themselves less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of fissors and fatherless, they could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators have worried, without his understanding, worried by his telephone numbers,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banana information, its lending service, and even travel intelligence with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">Among this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and risk of thought to condemn.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama talked to protect Whistleblower in his presence, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is home too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on National Security was the outcome of that a Whistleblower came to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we set the press work on the game that is protected by the first constituency because the government has always more possibilities to oppress all out.</seg>
<seg id="28">But as the technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can contact them from the moment, in which they contact, rather than in the neighbor, in the testimony of the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software, which still didn't existed when editing his book, and it is much more secure than normal emails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source file system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet's most famous, which was developed by us today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news website, like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send documents, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access to the respective News Agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot do more information secretly, and many of the information they would like it would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments develop new spy-technologies on all over the world, who are all endangered.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's easy to ensure that not only technology denominers such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to protect misalignment. it is just important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The about abuse during the supply of soldiers, knows and from overcrowded hospitals, or the next environment, the alarm to sealate water from Flint. or an Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect against our all constitutionality.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the greatest data collection of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that the rich and Mighty] [that means] Robert Palmer of Global Witness about a explanation.] this week we have been asked by messages about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama based in Panama law firm Moselle Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents provides a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers as a moshum Fonseca go and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you do it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, we can see the e-mails, exchanging messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has come back.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that a bundled of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad's neutered companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a lane of 2 billion US dollars will be President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others, the nervous waiting for the next publication, and on the next reveal documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cries away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide your assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this applies to us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these abstentions are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens of some few are used to hide, their wealth has been discussing and concealed -- something that we have discussing them for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appear very confusing this whole world, and it is difficult to understand how this tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has another company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand, who is behind this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there are fewer reports about this issue in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations, that scandal occurred.</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not so that there are no rich Americans that are hidden their assets in tax evens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle, after which these tax havens work, Moselle Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Indeed, in fact, it is necessary to specify less information in some US states to establish a company as a librarian identity card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This species of Intransparency in the United States allowed employees to zov up school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It does not allow operators to zooming especially vulnerable anks.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this type of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here we want to find out all this in practice, like all this in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an investigation into the offices of 13 specialised firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as African minister, the suspicious money into the US to buy a home, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really did that all until one advocate of our investigators make suggestions that he could transferring his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preferences. none of these lawyers actually took us as a client, and of course there was no man committed to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider that this is not considered as single incidents.</seg>
<seg id="78">It does not go about a single lawyer, who submitted to our secret investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top polite, wound in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to handle this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very much-usual sound as if we could do anything against it, as if nothing would have changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a recovered optimist, I definitely see that a lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen ahead to see more transparency, regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has recorded in central registers at the national level which is really located behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the U.S. is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill to the two parliamentary groups, but this does not make progress you would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the USA and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headfirms.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy that rise and say: "Intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and continue to stop this type of opacity by laws.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finish the Intransparency, which now makes this type of control curses, corruption and money laundering, finally finished.</seg>
<seg id="96">That's the story how I close almost once and in the boot of a red Mazdas landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design studies, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my attention.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was in the city alone and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">As we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep for this day?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He did the whole thing worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just knew it only! he says he would go to the peaccorps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the luggage boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">That's a small boot space!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said: "demonic, how?"</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night I was in bed, I starred to the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I broken there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got a fear that I went out of bed to the door and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he bought from me today is based in his classroom. he is a teacher now.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my eye-angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps people who were sold in childhood as strangers have been sold, really friends who were only waiting for them to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">It was normal for me on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Make a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my fellow worker attracts and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think that creativity can make it anxiety in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new fellow Brian Chesky: "Brian, I could overlay something like we could earn something. our apartment is on a designer bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including one mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created the "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress in wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They loved it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to taste our cheese ham-Omelet completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest, and the door to the castle, Brian and I fell.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to Roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow inhabitants, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the Investors: "we want to create a website dedicated to the people publicly pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, their doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">You can then invite you to the Internet via the internet to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile would ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one, who is yet full of comfort, would invest in a business, not allowed to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned, strangers have been dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">Once you have a problem, you get to the things you can well. we were able to design them.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we had learned that design is much more than just the appearance and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design work so something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a sample, which degrade would give to us.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will take you out of your instrument.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlock mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet Ancoring of panic, which you will feel right -- -- is exactly what you will feel when the first time open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing is personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone a foreigner in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel when they can stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">But, who now has Al Gores mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you declare on Twitter, that it dipped for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">Now you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What would be if we have changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor first appeared with his name, if he would have told you how his dog or his children will be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 assessments that all say: "he can really hold very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you want to cancel your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">For a well-covered feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to compare negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest their assessments before we issued it online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We performed with Stanford a study. we investigated how probably it is that people have confidence in each other, depending on how they are similar to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, that are most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find the less trusted we.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changed.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation with similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deep rooting times.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we drove that confidence is dependent on how much you get from there.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you're telling too little, for example, "Hi!", you will get no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">How much tells you how much: "I have trouble with my mother" -- -- will the request not be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree to openness, such as "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I will make my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design, create this level?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips to which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect, was the great amount of people who were more than ready to submit these supplies.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people are entitled to claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably a lot of luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been bred before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when it is not smooth running.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unlawful parties or houses devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing plimmerit than these calls. it is already hurt when I think of it only.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that listens to the voice of the callers, and will always be our greatest motivation to help us further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, of the 123 million overnight stays, only one fraction had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people treated one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If it works, Wonderful can be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay and he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his evaluation:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers that tend to heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protection hedgehogs that save life, although they don't know it really.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car in the hospital if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring them books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay even longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course not running every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure cash transaction is exactly what you want to reach with Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I was very proud of this concept for the first time, I asked:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of part with money transactions coming together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's been here about a economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But now just "home" to be known, the thing is not just.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When one travels today, this is to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be when travelling to a rich buffet from local stewes?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if you visited to wait a group there, a group there would be a thoroughly refill and a quarter of a Kneige's quarter, of which you have never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn to cook a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What would be when we would like to create apartments from the ground?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would happen if cities would accept the thoughts of a common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I present yourself cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and amortation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project had already begun. many parking places who belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Now people were offered to residents. students who were looking for a lead?</seg>
<seg id="241">They were mediated by people whose children were going out. they were incubator-programmes,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance the new start-ups in share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries are going to be guest at a foreigner or a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seemed to be so crazy about how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">But there was hospitality already before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from Happiness and Timing, we thought that you can find the correct design with the resources of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome our deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">To be overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it if a red Mazda goes on to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design can't solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we will be able to help you soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A faithful? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, underneath the brain underwear, a mist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or quite simply a delay on security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the fault for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most of those who would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably people don't talk with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslims: it's great, you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I'm a mother, a coffee-operated -- double espresso, with whipped cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am being mistaken,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchting-Fitness fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to opt it.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to ousted me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslims. I decided to bear my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you pressing yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The lessee was at that time, it was a feminist independence of independence, namely to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old to adapt it to a perfect and inable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have to know with the wean.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after, exhibited in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and lonely dedication to commit himself with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm gathers me sometimes to the crying.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know it myself. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Had you ever feeling the feeling that someone does not perceive you completely, and somehow he loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I got married and started, as all the good Egyptian, my career in engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember probably exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, I had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "Eilary."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, aircrafts in buildings, people mocked out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical troubleshooting?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock got turned into indignation quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do so anything?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed to the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terror..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "Jihadist...",... "Jihadist..."... "mashed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only that of my country, but in the Nu relayed me the works of others from one citizen in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On that same day, we had to travel through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I drove me -- as we were silent - so deep it went to my seat, and I feared the first time than Muslims were recognized.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said: "be vigilly," be careful, "" be careful in good illuminated areas, "" meetings led you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then, it was Friday in that week -- the day to gather for Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings of feelings were unfortunate and I heard of attacks on Muslims, or of men who stayed for Muslims in the Free and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really branthanation on Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something was not felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this land have attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have swept the rage of people upon the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine that! I was also mad.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to use itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have no questions about questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">The allegations which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays, we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to connect Muslims and Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my congregation as of a tumor in the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or groove?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: one malicious tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour one keeps only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are Muslims, like all other Americans, no tumours in the body of the US, but an essential organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, narrator and Olympionids.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make a safer place?</seg>
<seg id="331">It may be free to hold a few parking but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque causes to consider people other faith tolerant, and greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington State area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radialised in their cellar or bed in front of one computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">At the radicalised process, it has found that it is online. as the first, the person is cut off from their family, so that the people may believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior, and their ideology, is a revenger or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim Islam: Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Lastly, a group like the IS had its brutality with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to add to their preferences if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion faithful.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But when looking for a look at them, they do not drives what they are in their Holy Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality, which they read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because they pre pre to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was surprised and asked him whether they have been in touch with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every clergy with whom she spoke, she brought them to silence, and told her that her wrath was to bring her mind for the injustice in the world, they only would be in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">From nothing to inspires and something that had been a sense of her rage, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization through extremists who spoke in a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam turned the connection to God and its church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse for their rage, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, it kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, like the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work on normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of anxiety every day to our democracy, to freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear us, happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We do rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and advantages.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: when people did news, in which negative about Muslims has been reported, they would have more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the moods were contrary to Muslims at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the ahead of the war war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction on Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermining the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">Maybe it might feel first, but the toxic air of fear would send us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collectors, it is not just about to explain to himself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented to dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he knew the most common, the most common man, whom they knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and he showed her his CV. she was astounding and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is this of my breasts such a young man become a young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit to Suzanne at her brother and his wife, she was murdered, the same as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon. he did it in their apartment, as in a execution after he postponds against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He fired eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism cannot only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We consider it and for us it was no easy decision, because it went to us to leave our children in America: one that would control us through anxiety, or one in whom we can exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to see the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we drove in silence to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, I drew off my shoes, went into the building hall, and what I saw that I kept.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely drunk.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then, the Imam announced an announcement, thanked, and called our guests welcome, because the half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-creditors who came to attack us, but to bite.</seg>
<seg id="387">In this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had courage and judging panic and prefences.</seg>
<seg id="389">What do you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you interested in the moment of anxiety and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to go on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you will join them that mean: we are better than those that are.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a Nerv.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask myself, what you might say that you are talking about a tEDtalk, a monument with deep-pass, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you don't know. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I'm so usually like it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When people look to Muslims in all over the world, and I did that with the biggest carried out study on Muslims in all over the world, people want to normal human things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am no exception in all respects.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as an exception to rule, then often the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: many thanks. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for bastler, it is short to become one billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Monitoring, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before airpact enters our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flight machines at Frac Centre in France has built a six-metre-high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with lines.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting the passengers achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-free structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to bear loads, to deal with turbulence and to react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to work an autonomous system, we need to know collectively collectively, where the mobile objects are located in the area.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that's possible to focus on the rapid development of dynamic growth.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new location technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room where the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are in the highest image. "such as" start "and" landing. "</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called stern starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight unit, that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starters, it can hover, and has great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a sweeping side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedgecutters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight is no matter what the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved thanks to practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions leading to the core of the cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known for example as machines with a thousand movable parts that were ammate to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Four decades ago, the trained pilots could fly remote-controlled flight devices that had only two moving parts: one propeller and a stern thruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">It has been undiscovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote control unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, one propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No clapping, hinges and transverse, no further positions or controllers, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it's mechanically simulations, happen in the interior very much, so it can fly stable and can move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it doesn't have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to bring it to fly, I need to throw it pretty right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood, if all look on, is small, therefore, I'll show you a video that was filmed in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinner is an exercise in genome, this machine is here, the omnihead with its eight propellers, a exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not balanced.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">He will receive the utmost ordinary ability of God,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving into space in all directions, no matter what directions is turned or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is adjustable in models, the rest is taught directly at flies.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If passengers should have part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When they build it together, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a little bit wrong - a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery - can fly the machine further, even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that, having a half of airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a wide range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We performed standard Micro-Quadcopter - each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and outfit them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where the room is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, encourage this demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there would like to do a flying lamp screen on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is hard to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the salary is in the development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, wise snips allowed to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive professional and economic potential, the tittle on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">About 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes in a very far distant galaxy is getting faster, they turned so the mass of three uns in pure energy in a pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment it shined brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big Knall.</seg>
<seg id="472">They cannot put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-gearing itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Then we arrange events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">At 1.3 billion years ago, multizelliges was formed on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God arise for us - even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of extra Much-- Rai Weiss recently decided by MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which arise about Colombian black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them stayed for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people know them as a mad man, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation sponsored their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, concept and extremely hard-hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser interferometry gravitational-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of LIGO was significantly increased significantly, giving the detection of enormously enormously improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">It is therefore called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a final test run, some smaller, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves propelled the two colliating black holes through the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were emotional than that:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my dad's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I had worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physics at the MIT. he has been investigated for 23 years of gravitational waves like LIGO measurable signals. but what are Gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a ruction in the hubs of room and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the wave, the space and its entire content can be stretched to one direction and stretched out into the other side.</seg>
<seg id="495">In the illustration of illustrative theory, Dozard often lead to relativity-theory often a right albering dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, expand and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched and stretched by us during the meeting of the waves, the expansion of an average human being was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means that 20 zeros after the compass, followed by a 1. therefore, the LIGO workers explained to be crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">Using a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, it would have to be less than a centimeter of the radius of a nuclear-core. that's grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for waves like this: "the technical difficulties of construction of such detectors are massive.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are final and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims that LIGO would be more an ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: expressions, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite practical. for example, you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking off the coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very hard, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you very much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to specific properties like sound layer and -height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice says now."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"grief Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same is gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can not make any simple images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by changing the changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">If we convert wave pattern to sound, we can listen to all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">Gravity, the gravitation allows us to betray about the collision of two black holes, with which my collector Scott is already busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, zircons simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very quickly, just stop the same Zirpen with an additional sound change. that sounds like to: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement spelling, expressed in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that I never forget -- heard LIGO the following: [Surrender [Gerch] Every one knows what he must hear, recognize this as a sound by -- SH:... two black holes with 30 times of sunshine as quickly as the staves of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we are superior to us what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 grass, the other with a mass of 36 bules, revolve one hundred times a second before they colonise.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">It is the lasting importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO shows a completely new way to exploring the universe as they never before was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the All and invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all, we can practice -- practically or basically --.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to explode why a high quality stars in Supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned much about the all.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical intages are done, but at the core which lies behind thousands of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrating iron, than if it would be transparent glass. I'd love to explore the first minutes of the universe - but we will never see it because the urcrust covers his own reins.</seg>
<seg id="541">By means of gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And that's most important: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we will never see, and from which we don't have any idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">Indeed, LIGO was in the first attempt of things that we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says this topic: me: the kind of stars, the black holes are observed, like LIGO them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO enables us to view a completely different viewing angle at all, in the development of the stars and ultimately how we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be, as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and the noise and the tracks of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be beautiful than the urcrust itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now it is time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you agree with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For one year I would be too all "Yes!" I feared that I feared me.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it took me nervous, I brought me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes".</seg>
<seg id="557">Wanted I to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted I to start playing the game?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: exactly that, what I feared, I feared my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">Fear to keep speeches, my social fear -- Puff, weg.</seg>
<seg id="565">The Power of One word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that changed my life to something unexpected. it started with a question of my little.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for all "estimations,"</seg>
<seg id="570">When she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimation, I need milk for my gumbilical ver."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked them once, if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude of life in my family. from there I swears to play always with them as soon as you do, or whither I go, I say always Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an astounding tribution. only recently, I guess that "Yes" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am familiar. I think things, raised up the life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I make TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing TV, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carry out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that previously existed.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television channel can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, four shows, thus all nine days 20 Million Dollar TV, four broadcasts, the same time in production, four episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Counsel, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 Hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series will run on Thursday evening on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shipments that I have created himself, and not only produced, so still remain clean. I have to find time, truly quiet, creative time to watch my fans and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that are round around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I do not want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of you that are so hard working, whether you have a company, a business or a budget, do you understand that I don't just tell your computer, and it's right when I say: I understand that there is not a dream job in dream.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, everything work, all reality, all the blood, all silence - no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm getting deeper into the job, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">When I was up, I found it when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">That's how dreaming about a high tone, lieve a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that is at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicuous, naughty, and maternal, cruelly and reasonable. and the best to it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working is well running.</seg>
<seg id="614">A Summerry begins in my head, and it grows and growing, and the sums sounds like an animated street, I could always go on it for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, if I declare to them the sums that I think the writing is dressed for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- as I began to work with the TV production began to work and work, to create and work, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum of the sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sum of the sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums are God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you can't strive any other than in size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not different to strive, no matter what price does.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means an workflow.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it means genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I did not make for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just said to you, I am a titanium, and I know that I want to ask it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: ever more more shows, the more episodes, the more more episodes, the more works there, the more things see me, the more things I write on history, the more expectations there are more expectations.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more you have to work me.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the linen, the great sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I'm the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stopped the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single job title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells us: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "estimates, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work no more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not return.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums were broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15-day-days, labeled weekends, no Reuter, but not delegate, one Titan sleeps not, with all your heart, clear eyes what also always.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview of Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I didn't have fun any more.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if that's what you do, the work that you love, have suddenly mised?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some may think: "hay you, the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you can do if you are doing, man loves to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves another, and that's the sums when you stop the sums when the sums stops when the sums stops, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you like?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart can I survive, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "Southern States waitress" presented me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I'm on the way to her late and she says: "mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will already say no, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to everything and second, she called me not "estimates."</seg>
<seg id="675">They call no more "estimations."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it if I am Titan I and my sums, and this changes everything before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And this she says, "mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters with it, we laugh much and I read very dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the sums, I can't do anything else.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the great sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything exists, sticky finger and moist kisses, tender voices, wax pins and the song, in which it goes well, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">An incremental door goes to and another energy club comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the titanium, that is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, who are you if I am when I'm using my brain through broadcasts and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum of the sums is no strength and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum of the sums is the river which comes from the living.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums are ignored the print of history, to do the tasks, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums of God is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps flattened me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I usually make sure that I can deliver me as an workflow of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's the law I have no choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it was so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">To play, don't really want to work as we work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer my workplace as the home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This thing confession is painful, because what a person is better to be able to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I am.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honest, I call myself "Titan's --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too cold, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rushes around the garden, and back, and back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance-parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We disbursted soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiffly, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always gonna start to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how one lives, and the sums of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why did we ever listen to playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say! do they say then Yes, if your child want to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me for naiv, a day event.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you probably be right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they get rid of them something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">We are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes you will replace a Marienkaefer or biscuit.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my Teenie daughter has 15 minutes long with me, I am Mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more need not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad-mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no deposit steering.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children begged.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellbeing, my world. they do not have the children to feel the sums to feel a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It does not play with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play "games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Take the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect there. I will fail and I will win. friends meeting books, books, the day enjoy --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" it's short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got my first TV show when I wanted to go more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not going for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my leisure time. the sums seem to return, when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens up, and I find myself in my office. I listened to new ideas. that sums lead me to new ideas. I use it into full breeders and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums that buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubble insist and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">Now that is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of the work is part of me, but just a part. and therefore I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's me to me that I am a titanium. I never saw a Titan who plays to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet, I have everything in the handle. my brain is even functional. my bonfires are even burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happy are I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more feel good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land which I run, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the margins, the sums, the sums that sums the right sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, troubled, naked and new life in me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things I think you raised to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and play more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgery, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through different surgical actions.</seg>
<seg id="804">They also have one of the best known ones, the "low-accumulation," which implanted the electrode deep in the brain, in order to influence the circuits of neurons that improves neurologic function.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's destitute, having stayed under heavy trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">We wish to approach this dream to us.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close together.</seg>
<seg id="810">Some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was leading medical doctor and worked in the emergency exit day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with cranial brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that at skull-brain traumata must be tilted the brain and the brain scull is tilted.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this purpose I have to remove a part of swollen brain balance.</seg>
<seg id="817">Rather than to throw the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze us with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">The cells are grown from a tissue, similar to small children that will be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and environments to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">It was just that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as such as a stem cell culture. with big green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you may know from the biology lessons that stem cells are unripe, that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small grove of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OR.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were changed differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but it behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand from whence they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called the Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have it in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of the cerebral cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain in the non-language area and then the cells are just as cultured as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they are then marked in colour to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the outlet of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we implanting the same cells in the dignate brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were working with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they had been taken away after several weeks, they would have been taken back home. the room is already busy, they are not needed, so vanish them.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation of and implanted the same cells, and now the cells remained, and they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof of these are these small points. these are the cells that we in vitro in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We couldn't stop this here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey, to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feeding pellets with a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they achieved a stable skill level, we last in the motor Cortex of the manual Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brains. they recover to a certain degree, just like the apes.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure the monkey achieved his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its initial performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Watch now, when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can say you, that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can then freeze and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still, to implant it with people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know anyone who can need."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely be sure.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what is the greatest obstacles before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the largest obstacles are the authorities. starting from this great results you have to fill about two kilogram papers and forms to pass these kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delikat etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a fast team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to receive permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to see in the future, how many years it will take until someone can come into the hospital, and this therapy is available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then we have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply this to a multi-centralized study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must really refer to that it is useful before being able to offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is certainly, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us of it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We are doing a big mistake to view it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see the democracy not as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as unchangeable hazard.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is forced to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Peking asdoubtedly proved that it is possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy in Europe disappears.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- became unambiguous as a finance minister in the Eurogroup - unambiguous that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- does not influence the savings programmes that were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China that repeatedly said that the democracy would be abolished if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">In this place I would like to present a economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I pray you, together with me to believe that Lee kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of error, we could save the democracy, but that we need a real and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies will foster our future dark and spectacular, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On this topic, I would like to refer to an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our business.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call the "Gems Summit-Paradox".</seg>
<seg id="916">One summit is known to you. you know and acknowledge him as the Schodenberg that throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schoolberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the seeable asparagus and corporations, which could be investing in it, where it would be productive and income, with which one could produce the debt relief and even all the things could be urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the last 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars have been invested in all the prosperity of goods, such as industrial equipment, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3.4 trillion, after lots of money, it is compensated for a lot of money until it is equivalent to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exams and instalinate real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and non-productive capital are facing the twin summit which did not trigger the normal market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which could not implement the pessimism of investors, which could not be investing in which they could kill him. just like Ödipus Father, who would kill him that his son would kill him when he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Untrimmed the circumstances that lead to it, that the ovarian are kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely precious item. all the inproductive capital should be used to develop our lives, developing the human talents and particularly to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to rescue the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is Democracy The Solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think. but before we proceed: what do we understand among democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as a company form, to control the open and the poor as a majority the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy decided to naturally many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Of course, women, foreigners, and natural slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to reduce the job value of the athenian democracy in due to these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the athenian democracy was and is that they gave the work to the working arms, but not only the right to free expression of opinion, but important and decisive, which gives them the right to political participation with the same mood balancing in questions of the State Ballet.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenian democracy took not long as long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that illuminates very light, it is also hatched out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our current liberal democracy found their roots not in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the processed arms, the liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling nations.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only emerged when a complete separation of politics and economy would be possible, while the democratic process became acclimitated while the economy - so the world of the corporations -- a democratieFree Zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democracies, since that date, in which the separation of politics and economy began, a relatial struggle between the two instead, by the economy gradually emigrants and lawns them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer like that?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not located on an Degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It lies in it that one can be nowadays in the government, but still not in power because power from politics into the economy is preoccupied and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my Hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of noise, which so lasting the animals, of which they are nourished, decimated that they are hungry at the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similarly to the economy, which has led politics as far as a self-created economic crisis. the power of the corporations grows, political goods are rising, the economic demand is falling and the managing director of the corporations are to be severely pained to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">According to the success of capitalism, "Demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher will become the twin vision, and the greater the waste of human labor power and the fact of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and economy again, and it would be better when the "Demos" retains control, as in the ancient of Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea for this.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had this idea about 100 years ago and it wasn't especially good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the Soviet Union should be that the working arms should recover only by a wonder a position as in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of breeding and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to create the processed arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing low wage by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that as long as economy and politics are separated, the automation will be higher, the waste, and social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China is coming.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must redesign the economy and again unite the economy and politics, and make sure that we can democratically elected the restored area of surveillance, otherwise we are able to show the film "Matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism showed up the technical achievements which he has caused to survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether the capitalism is similar to "matrix, similar to those of" Star Trek, "which is similar to humans and people in the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian" Agora, "in long conversations the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek "-like Utopia instead of the" matrix "like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: ask yourself a capital market, where you have earned money, while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a workplace to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is ownership of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and proceeds from revenue and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, but people who are not working there, and employees who do not belong there. no Diving more between capital and work, no large gaps between investment and spars, and finally no outstanding twins peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please explain that our national currencies have a free fluctuation rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade will be traded in this currency - we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" '-- and every government paying the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading platform of the respective country, in a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world where investment means are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one was not the technical resources then.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in front of a restored policies and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, whom I choose to you, is liberally liberal, in which they privileged individuals prefers and marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Are we waking up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to fall into a "matrix" - similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide ourselves together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It's in our hands, and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You defend yourself as liberal Marxists yourself in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything from what I have just said is that Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and business is... do we do that, technological development will create a so massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry summers called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only be our democracy, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is applicable, Marx is absolutely relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and therefore I am completely confusing.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophy -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who mentioned this. BG: in your lecture they mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner you have very clear what you hold on the view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat this here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracy we have the note of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited the democracy to politics, while the area where the most of the economy, -- the sector of economy -- a totally democrayfree zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain respects, if I may say that so provocative, China is similar to China today's England 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- Do you remember - we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historical.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">It was especially skeptical that affects the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What is happening in China now is similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now refuse to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells amazing after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners were curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal sight, and very disappointing, because we had the chance to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to complying, and the debt relief measures that a massive refining line was threatened by the euro zone and continues to be massively at the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek premings -- the way, the first suggestion was to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately, it was right to do. unfortunately, the powers in the euro zone, elected within the European group, still refusal.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to get an economic system that is not overviable, due to political will and authitarianism, it may be delayed a while, but if the change happens, it has abruptly abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: which changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future when we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have any error in your time as finance ministers?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister, who, after 6 months in office, claims particularly in a clamped situation, he did not have any mistakes, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the request for prolongation of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honourable interest on pages of the walker, to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But this was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They wanted only to bring our government to fall, just because they were not going to negotiate with the euro zone by the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to pass a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika's Troika, who has imposed this policy, was: "that was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all the, and despite the aggressive Tons of talks, you still seem to be quite per-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone, from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if she did not survive, the released flip-forces will be diabolically and the European Union are destroying.</seg>
<seg id="1032">That will not be catastrophic in Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we propose the way to a post-trial in 1930, after that it appears to me, it will also be able to be able to be the future of the Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you're wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you so that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price ever heard of the majority, though he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision, the Roy had met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, has a Igelfrisur and describes in Twitter as "films, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing the shows and content that will produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, that is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy do not have to select either.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are quite right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series at the IMDB website. its evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are preserved.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">That shows shows how "Breaking Bath," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows, the addictive, where, after you saw a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of Show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows how "Toddlers and Tiaras," -- which should tell you what at the end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not respond to the left side of the curve, because I think you're already specific intelligence, to offer "Toddler and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle school, average TV -- shows, which are neither good or bad, they will be inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon wants to do something that Amazon wants to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he keeps a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and elects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and displays them online, where they can watch one for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives out free things, you get too, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watching this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they will be seen when watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team to record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They capture when you start the show when you wake up, what parts you want to skip or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide to decide which show they should produce them.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact they gather the data, process, and this results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican U.S. transformers."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many of them can remember this show, because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's only an average show - in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve represents 7.4, and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- therefore something above average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company, another manager has a top-show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy is always on search to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but it does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of staffing a contest, he and his team have seen the existing data about Netflix audience, so the reviews they give to the shows, whose shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find out these small details about the audience: which shows they like what producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went with a venture, and decided to do not a Sitcom via four transformers, but a drama series about a Senator to make.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">The House of Cards "receives a 9.1 Review on this bend. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data experienced companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic happens somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data, for a decision to meet you, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years to statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">One optimized it through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working, this is something terrifying, because we are living in a time, in which we are more and more statistics, to hit serious decisions so far beyond the TV.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone knows the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">None. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in contact with this software in contact with this software. come in contact with this software.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone is in the U.S. in the prison and asked for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad it is decided whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there are evidence that these data analysis, despite the many specifications,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. this is not that a company like Multi-Health Systems did not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data in the most important companies are also false.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is possible to predict the loss of data analysis by the flu, the worse way - by data analysis of the Google search.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news of news. the success culminated in a release in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It didn't work, that was again a sensation when the restart of the publication in the journal Nature "published in the magazine" Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google do sometimes understand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all of these errors caused by the decisions of life a -- at the workplace, at the legal rule, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- an area where some very smart people can utilize many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer treatment</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of an medicament. over the years I detected some pattern on the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions. the samples should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first-to-place this problem in its individual parts, so that you can analyse the single parts; as a second set the single parts again put together to set a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: to be taken apart and again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help load a problem and understand his parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good for the brain, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, then, if the information is not complete, especially if it's the brain's brain.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think that Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to understand how to understand the audience what else they would not have been able to put together. but the decision to assemble all those parts again, and make it a show like "House of Cards" which doesn't stand in data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered into a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they played TV ideas, then chose the Alpha House as the show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they could always say: "they say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things are wrong, when data begin to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only one tool, and to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will become...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data, it was the decision for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions with a ja- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely," -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later interpret it later with a technique coding.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I met some decisions made in my life, where I should listen to the ball in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much, as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball touches and clever and smart. finally, it's right to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel very encouraging message, that in spite of the great amount of data always paid out to make decisions to make an expert in what you do, and risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, there are not data, but the risks associated with which you end up at the end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
