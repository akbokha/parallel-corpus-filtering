Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
an up@@ stream asc@@ ension , where you@@ ths should meet today .
a v@@ ault chapel where the tunnel is dug out for the S @-@ Bahn tun@@ nels .
small gar@@ den@@ ers achieve the unique reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is nerv@@ ed if maps are not currently available .
that knows anyone who had to pur@@ ify himself , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i was instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the state government , are all other than currently - but just very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
then , how cities and municipalities in the area of Munich have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a carpet est@@ ry that is not equal to such as such .
for towns and municipalities more detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ onic datashe@@ et , were incorporated .
this was created according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing Administration between 1810 and 1864 and the first measurement of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
since the spring of 1800 , French He@@ er@@ es@@ hip occupied Bavaria since the Second Coalition War with Austria .
on behalf of Napoleon inv@@ oked an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops come along with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of 9 February 1801 : they were the present N@@ eigh@@ bours who created the idea of a widespread Bayern @-@ map .
Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; and thereby strengthening the Bavarian survey@@ ing Administration .
the sanctuary for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is like all other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ du@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was meant 21 years after the establishment of the map , i.e. 1877 , when the Munich district entry was meant .
today sub@@ du@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses are located around 1856 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ erst@@ raße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er in 1878 , a leader of the bu@@ reau of the Bavarian farmers against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where the West park is , you can see nothing in fields - at first glance : if you zo@@ oming a small partial card with dozens lines and numbers : handwritten entries from the so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ ge , &quot; from which the property is derived from .
small plots there are no more farmers there - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is characterized by the north of sub@@ du@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , built in 1810 in the place of the Oktober@@ fest , had actually been a meadow - and no concrete desires in the 19th century .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map shows an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the territory of the district au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen in the territory of this district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen called not only the street name &quot; at the patio , &quot; or from the head@@ room &quot; On the fan , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; the asc@@ ension . &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ d@@ itor Street , one was once locked up people with extraordinary items .
in the year 1858 / 59 was the Munich @-@ Irish District Court &quot; On the Au@@ er Fan . &quot;
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the establishment - the psychiat@@ rist who is associated with King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was advanced for his time , and finished for example the anchor of the so @-@ called eg@@ .
in addition , he has taught the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the Ward .
initial unit for 280 patients was initially expanded , and was extended to 500 seats .
sometime , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the gy@@ ro@@ ast facility in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ s in Germany since 2006 .
in the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people are coming to the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and went into a youth house with training facilities .
west is the soccer field of the TS@@ V Munich East , East of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house , &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - re@@ established in architectural re@@ jection to the original building of the Irish army , which was destroyed during the Second World War .
the Marien@@ platz was registered in 1856 as &quot; principal place , &quot; the shopping street called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change was the Second World War also at the heart of Munich .
the allies of the Allies discovered many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a great day remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a v@@ ault chapel from the Middle Ages were once at Mari@@ enhof , where these days will work and take place on 5 April 2017 at the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ map can be compared with the aerial photo of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights published travel announcement for Missouri
the National Association for fo@@ ster@@ ing Far@@ es has issued a warning for colored people who travel due to the discri@@ min@@ ating policies and ra@@ cial attacks of the state after Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state of Missouri , which will come into force until August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a series of frag@@ ment@@ ing , road @-@ based inci@@ dents in the whole state and listed here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recent Act of Missouri that makes it heavier and discrimination against discrimination as well as the prosec@@ ut@@ en@@ forcement agencies of the state that aim un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate to minority groups , said NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; they have injuries to citizens , through human rights .
they are considered due to their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has been issued for a state in the US .
the group of inci@@ dents were ra@@ ced against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man of Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under frag@@ mented circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more petrol during the journey through the government , and by the police of Missouri was charged without a crime .
the Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the General Office of Missouri , which is shown that black car drivers will be more likely to be considered as white in the state .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; people need to be ready to bring the money , or to know the relatives that they travel through the state . &quot;
in 2015 , Missouri was recorded in 2015 , after the latest numbers from an anti @-@ crime report of the FB@@ I , which ranks the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th ranks of the country .
the travel policy is also an answer to a new Missouri Act that would make it difficult to compl@@ ain a company for business or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ian Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel records for Texas and Arizona , after which States had approved the authorities to commit local prosecution authorities to under@@ take people because of immigration fr@@ aud , which will contribute to the further pen@@ ance of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel records are usually issued from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of other countries but in the last time advoc@@ acy groups the action is deployed to certain laws and trends within the USA .
Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ us project is Elem@@ ental
the fisher@@ man &apos;s electric fence project is a success project and will continue in the next year .
the CDU federal campaigns Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided a picture on the spot .
at the administration of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EP@@ s together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EP@@ s .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann also granted in@@ sights into its operation , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals , and houses in five apartments of Budapest .
for him , the Black Forest C@@ milk &quot; is the way of the Alternative market to milk , the milk of its cows , so swi@@ v@@ eling .
the regional corner of the Feri@@ a festival is exclusively local .
since he is also important to B@@ L@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , it is important to the &quot; Elem@@ ental Project as &quot; Elem@@ ent@@ ar . &quot;
I can not generate profitable areas on such steep surfaces .
the green space for much work , much must be treated with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; emphas@@ ized Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
in 2003 , he took over the ter@@ restrial operation and carried out this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it lead no bio @-@ operation .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the community has recognized the importance of the electric fence and is happy about leader funding . &quot;
at costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported .
one hope that the view of the faces could still be moved for a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and mind thoughts , as they bring forth their operation , &quot; emphas@@ ised the mayor .
farmers are often in criticism of criticism
throughout 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the accounting area is thus 40 hectares which can not be stopped for at least 2023 .
of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half of funding was funded , a quarter contributed to the village of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
consequently , the farmers remained invested € 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of wheat fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac emphas@@ ized : &quot; you do not make a good job , no farmer and landing is not going to go . &quot;
also for Peter White Rose : &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot;
the State Coun@@ cill@@ or ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg and the State Promotion of Wei@@ de@@ fence .
the goal is the accounting of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR in pat@@ rons .
in addition , the in@@ sof@@ ar area cannot be tra@@ ff@@ ed ( hang@@ ings of over 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the asc@@ ension .
for the f@@ ish@@ al Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ us project 2018 now the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would build nearly 16 kilometers of fence .
the accounting area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated cost amounts to more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes off the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to begin to attack the statues .
the Americans are as well as every other - therefore the un@@ claimed overthrow of Saddam H@@ uss@@ one at the Fir@@ dos in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did , when he had a symbolic dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposal of the President for dra@@ stic limits of legitim@@ ate obj@@ ection to the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of Bo@@ at@@ ters and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators would have looked after him if he had done it .
but he took their significance , and especially the significance that was attributed to her , when the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus was 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .
when Miller was called A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an icon of American freedom that ligh@@ tens the world .
the po@@ em , which you refer to that later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is proper correctly , but as it formulated it itself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the r@@ üt@@ ting words of Lazarus , the only one , in which a state does not load any old immig@@ rants , but the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your labour , your poor , are free to bre@@ athe yourself ; the poor out of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time to see in which the &quot; ling@@ ering waste &quot; was better visible on our screens .
in Miller , Miller did not eng@@ age in literary criticism - he clearly showed that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural con@@ front@@ ation : it is in fact a conflict in the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who conf@@ used to place their words after her death on the base - were very good that they completed a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Rep@@ ublic@@ s by creating the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her po@@ em is the female figure no more abstract - it has received a voice .
and she has another name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to re@@ tire from the right wing .
the great cry of Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is one of the early Ne@@ o@@ con@@ ia that the American flame goes into the world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proce@@ eding .
you should wear the tor@@ ch of the freedom of the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
quite un@@ usually , lem@@ bau@@ gh is sk@@ ated here .
the meaning of the statue is whole and even a matter of vision of perception .
the huge imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was it that they see how they had seen from the exhau@@ sted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travel on the de@@ cks of ships was seen .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome that they must hear .
and that &apos;s not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to know .
their tor@@ ch shall not ligh@@ ten the way , but the hat@@ red that is their only source of power is infl@@ amed .
world Championships 2017 : Neil Black commen@@ ds Scottish members of the United Kingdom
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two carrots belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance of the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent will be aff@@ ord to the team &quot; a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; Scotland has developed something special &quot; in Scotland &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to find out until we &apos;ll find out , &quot; Black said .
&quot; I talk with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has done something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they did .
British athl@@ ete : it has something to do what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals of candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was elected in the team at the team captain .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite modest .
their mission statement was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or where they still live or practice , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the genuine feeling that express the Eil@@ id@@ h entirely of course were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ Silver medal winner , which will compete with its fifth World Championships for the 400 m Hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 sh@@ ot@@ ters were in the British team .
the largest number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance Mu@@ ir leads along this path and has launched five British and two European recru@@ itment in the past year .
it will take part at 1,500 m and 5.000 m of runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another s@@ wis@@ er , which one should keep the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first World Championships as the only other S@@ cot in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the economic capit@@ als says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; to the fact that many of her country sk@@ iers will not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and at the final .
&quot; to be the special about team capit@@ als , it is that they had been chosen by the other members of the team , but to know that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and voted to make it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i , who belong to the team .
it just shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ ds .
what my speech as captains in capital ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to use this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympic stadium .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and it &apos;s just like a great atmosphere . &quot;
aband@@ on Facebook : do not block on Facebook : do not cause a public office if you do not toler@@ ate them from voters
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him for all , from the inner policy to its political principles .
he sh@@ im@@ ed with the cr@@ iti@@ que , sure .
but he did not have his critics to silence .
for the year 1783 Washington said : &quot; the freedom of freedom can be taken away - and , st@@ up@@ id , and dum@@ b , we shall be led as sheep for the slaughter . &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Govern@@ or Larry H@@ og@@ an , who needs to be working like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked contributions from at least 450 people and deleted their views on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ian Union def@@ endants this week as early as the beginning of this week .
the staff of the Govern@@ ors dismissed the law@@ suit as a fri@@ vol , and the online comment was full of a response with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy such as H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors members of the Nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a ac@@ tionary p@@ inion .
he has shown strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons , which come to the side of the governor - which is an official forum , which is officially declared officially and of employees who are paid by public tax @-@ dollar - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ ending H@@ og@@ ans spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s easy to use the image of tro@@ ve or cav@@ ing or h@@ ash filled people that force the wh@@ ip online .
the Post talked with some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no Tro@@ l@@ le .
they all said that their comments are resp@@ ect@@ ful , conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able and not prof@@ ited .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and he appe@@ aled the Catholic faith in H@@ og@@ ans .
attor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not wet , but he asked them to hate hate .
&quot; I commented on me that I was dis@@ appointed , that there was no reaction to hate Hass@@ le and other current news , &quot; he wrote in the comment field of the message with &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I do not consider this idea if a number of people in the same topic , then , they are mis@@ used by some more than a so @-@ called collective , and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the staff of the governor as &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack , &quot; would call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a critic or a negative comment .
it &apos;s a lot more clean than in previous time when people had done that employee were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical fe@@ ar@@ ches and to be burned and to be burned to the silence .
but this just happens to happen .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials , who critic@@ ized him that he has been implic@@ ated Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users , blocked by Twitter Feed .
one of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the president of the Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , the first A@@ im@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is , Alexandria , described a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect like the Internet .
the number of newspapers , varied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous , tail@@ ored to his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had been Tro@@ l@@ le .
the people who pseud@@ onym@@ s like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; wrote , wrote all letters to newspapers , making Washington &apos;s decisions .
pet@@ itions , which critic@@ ised its position on the contract of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping , with the United Kingdom , simply overwhel@@ med their position , according to historical documents written by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t put them to silence .
freedom of freedom , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ a@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans n ° 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ a@@ ty will hope in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lor@@ ian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led the past year by the Ar@@ kan@@ field links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new venue and acts as the tournament ambassador in the name of the association and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance @-@ Club was built , and we see how he achieved his praise with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ a@@ ty .
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition .
Jerry has made a great job when he set out this place .
he is a e@@ ager@@ ly advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of its performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he has won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player said in South@@ west .
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open because it was in the year after I had won them out of the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the Mem@@ ories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European senior tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to the home floor .
this event will be the first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management The Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it &apos;s always a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want it well , but you don &apos;t feel this extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf course .
I &apos;m glad about how it has gone so far . &quot;
with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and senior champion Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ter .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sh@@ all@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
admission is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants .
all proceeds will go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer people have died for lung cancer in the past two decades .
scientists from the University Clinic of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) took place in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passi@@ v@@ smoking , &quot; said chief conductor Hei@@ ko Becher .
in comparison , he moved to this topic with this issue from 1994 .
at that time , there have been 400 pneum@@ o@@ gens due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study was published in the International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections are toler@@ ated as a very complex
construction works in Vill@@ inger road are in full swing and are reas@@ on@@ ably less in time , &quot; thus the director of the building Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of home connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there are much amounts in the substr@@ ate , which is not indicated in the plans .
the traffic , which is always ob@@ struc@@ tive to the construction work , represents a great problem for m@@ hr@@ ams of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ate of motor@@ ists in red lights and shut@@ down is already enormous , &quot; reported Hein@@ ze .
the road is locked and only the line buses are entitled to pass through .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p company has been working with the work on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were already very beautiful .
but fortunately we have looked after by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ er@@ i is bo@@ iled for dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
they even uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ul@@ ship in the un@@ quiet Indonesian Province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour , the carbon@@ ized kne@@ e is taken out and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the mid@@ wives - she has no furnishings , where it also has their daily work , such as clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sum@@ p .
a bucket in a homeless space is used as a lat@@ ch .
the youngest of the four wife of her husband have not been assigned to their own fields .
poly@@ gam@@ ie is usual here .
of course , it can be too late to work dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; no one says , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was added in 1969 following a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders were to vote off the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which had touched independence against the Dutch rule , turned back to the government of Jakarta sent control of the region and foreign journalists or legal gu@@ ards .
in 2003 , the province officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is desert . the journey includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a tomorrow 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transportation .
the town with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consist of wooden houses that are surrounded by bam@@ bo@@ o f@@ ences , and made of corrugated roofs , which were converted by rust in various b@@ b@@ brown tones .
only very few In@@ don@@ esians did their trip here , viol@@ ently because journalists and practically no foreigners .

&quot; we had only had leaves to our body . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s warm@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s health and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a province of New Jersey , with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has been dis@@ band@@ ed for gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has a total of 78 billion US dollars on wood resources .
however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensures that Indonesia will keep a stran@@ gling presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort Local military personnel and units had paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , among them up to 150,000 US dollars on a single officer .
par@@ an@@ ic claims after major autonomy threat@@ ening this golden go@@ ose and are treated pleasure .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua has been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
massacre in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s headquarters in Pap@@ u@@ as in the 1970 @-@ 1990s became the genocide of genocide by the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police captured over 3,@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers in the past year .
&quot; we are entitled to impos@@ e everything , &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Brisbane from the year 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electro@@ uses are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
screws have strengthened himself as Pap@@ u@@ as resources provide a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development changes from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .

&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chick@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua explains , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local in the province capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
in 2014 , the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in folk and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to tackle the ine@@ qualities and the infr@@ in@@ gement in Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmermann took 27 out of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the loc@@ als are che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have agreed for j@@ ok@@ ow@@ i with the expect@@ ation that He will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep spot only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 there was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas Car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke off on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the fri@@ gh@@ tened children told them that they should put their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their sound and later returned to four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hunting , and struck the group with their ri@@ fl@@ ons , spoke victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers mo@@ ist in the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ um@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things es@@ cal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together on a football pitch in front of the local police station and to demand justice .
it carried in m@@ oni@@ ously Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - a circle running and a bird @-@ ch@@ ill@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones to police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers was sent out a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have aff@@ ord more than three times , they shoot at the official document of TI@@ ME , which was not permitted to local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Four@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatened danger and called for tranquility and called to return home .
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I was turned , my left hand was turned into my left hand , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colourful wooden house .
k@@ ay@@ ame still didn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers .
&quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native male Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; I tried to him and searched his body to make sure that he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who bears just a name , named TI@@ ME in dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the che@@ ating @-@ spec@@ trometer of the pap@@ ua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ing , told repor@@ ters that his officers only wanted to secure their station , because they will be attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people threatened to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news on the mo@@ cks came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks Jok@@ tan in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for families of victims and s@@ ware to tackle the historical ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; I want this case immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said .
in October 2016 , the f@@ anto security minister Will Provi@@ de that it infr@@ in@@ gement an extra@@ judicial mechanism to the side of historical human rights ab@@ uses .
but the expul@@ sion started now almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred before long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early the 2000 @-@ ies .
the point is that we have committed to tackle this cl@@ ashes , but there are processes that must pass through , &quot; he said .
then , Wir@@ anto did a retreat when he spoke at the TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jakarta with TI@@ ME and said he have no plans in order to establish a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
f@@ anto lodged with the UN for crimes against humanity &quot; for crimes against humanity &quot; for crimes against humanity committed in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua had already been buried , including the pan@@ i@@ ai .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such alleg@@ ations with fierce un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people have fear in pan@@ i@@ ai to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I was buried the dead , the military sought to me , &quot; he says .
the shooting stars did not hear .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police seized vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between vill@@ agers and the managers of a bun@@ ch that refused to bring a conscious person into the hospital , one person and 17 other were injured , including children .
the man , who f@@ row@@ ned 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who f@@ row@@ ned in a nearby river , died on the way into the hospital .
insur@@ gent vill@@ agers prot@@ ested before the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers cast stones on officers who responded by taking warning shots .
but loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary Police ) began to shoot on the amount and killed one killed .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives in the vicinity of the hospital and witness , as the last here arrived quickly , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
in addition , the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to withdraw the officers of the police force and to withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a blem@@ ish for the Indonesian government .
lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the gen@@ esis Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , which live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel Army , which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by h@@ iring spor@@ adi@@ ers , attacks by in@@ dones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
as a reaction , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in the past few years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sover@@ eig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some dive again never again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is exactly the range .
the people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they reserve most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a tast@@ ed only 10,000 Indonesian Indonesian pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities are growing between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants which have arrived in a larger number since the opening of new air routes .
the few jobs that are in the region go usually to the better trained and we@@ al@@ thy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to competitive their own company competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions of the coverage of international media remain cl@@ amped .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp became deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to films .
according to ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy military director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jok@@ tan , were unable to raise restrictions on coverage to improve transparency and development .
&quot; there are new haz@@ ards for foreign journalists trying to report by In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens un@@ peaceful provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government will largely be restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March called six Pacific states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have been historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir reported the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system and there is free media , so it is difficult to conce@@ al the evidence of human rights attacks . &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments should know this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura visited him on May 4 , we propose freedom , according to a source that participated in the session but an@@ onym@@ ously to remain anonymous .
Indonesia issued a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua will say that they probably will not vote for Jok@@ tan .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but it is surrounded by people that are involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the headquarters .
he wants that Jok@@ ov@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people think that it lives under the constant thre@@ ats of a rob@@ ber@@ ic military , in poor educational and health services .
Gob@@ ai tells us that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people like other Pap@@ ua , had their voice for Jok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt , &quot; which he must pay back .
&quot; they do not need money , they just want righteousness , &quot; he says .
despite the dr@@ en@@ ings and en@@ rol@@ ments , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ers led a last symbolic act of the Trot@@ sky@@ â : the glue of an sacrifice was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they may not know that there will never be justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget her crime .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with down@@ cast head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos;s sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
a fire was found in one of the highest towers in the world in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of inhabitants , of which 337 meters high , 79 @-@ storey buildings flee .
it is the second fire that was hit by the sky@@ scra@@ per in just two years , it is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injury were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of flame .
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire al@@ arms and at the cry of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor down , &quot; told an inhabit@@ ant who numbered his name as George , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil authorities said that units of fire fighting at 4.00 PM local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire b@@ aked and the building was cooled .
the Government said that it work in the provision of accommodation for the data subject .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outer areas of high houses across the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage from the cl@@ adding , the outside covering for decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and clothing at the Gren@@ ade tower in June could have contributed to the spread of a fire in June with about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the only revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single was only supported on two winning sets , Hau@@ ch@@ thin is not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long but even so very estimated five @-@ set classics remain the traditional contest .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ cely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are dis@@ appointed that our Members will not have the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these Iber@@ ian and historic competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
you will continue to work to improve the application .
not until the vote , however , the suggest@@ ion had come to carry out the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 , only compar@@ atively smaller details : fin@@ alists will have the host rights in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will start the host in the first round .
in order to reduce the cost of the organis@@ ers , the requirements regarding training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will be able to complete the Davis Cup less official media @-@ dates .
more than 1 out of 5 US trav@@ ellers bring out objects into plane , takes a survey out of
a survey conducted by Air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent are aware , or un@@ aware objects on the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which carried the plane , while they were acci@@ dentally banned knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they would have been delayed that they were ir@@ resist@@ ible with fire@@ arm , amm@@ o or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey carried out in more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , it also demonstrated that younger trav@@ ellers ab@@ rupt the rules .
of those question@@ ed that they have been deliber@@ ately tried to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common items listed on T@@ SA agents have been deliber@@ ately settled , were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent charged wi@@ ped items with blades caused by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male poll@@ s have also confirmed that they had been deliber@@ ately forbidden drugs into the aircraft .
the company said that trav@@ ellers have inter@@ viewed throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally ug@@ ug@@ g@@ ware caused by the airport security and how many it had been inten@@ tionally .
it &apos;s no surprise that people who are most likely to do so or wi@@ per - through security , those who were most frequently used .
the company however indicates that T@@ SA guidelines are slightly complicated and conf@@ used .
people are often in@@ secure , which allow liquids to take them or how much of it .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the largest amount of the objects used by the T@@ SA was used for liquids .
for a time , people thought that T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware .
liquids are allowed in domestic flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers .
electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives people with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tesla Model 3 .
in this case , he has yet under@@ gone that a part of the customer has withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the triumph@@ al numbers of sales enh@@ ancements and more of more @-@ more targets , Tesla @-@ chief El@@ on Mus@@ k declared for the first time a second , less smooth number : the cancellations made by the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had frequently asked more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car in the past months , whose delivery is just starting .
now Mus@@ k is a : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 had already been withdrawn .
critics always had been pointed out that it only negoti@@ ated for non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla paid the 1000 euro in the US ( 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) .
at present , 45@@ 5.000 of such com@@ mitt@@ edly reservations confirmed , Mus@@ k was in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts .
however , the Tesla Group has not been able to issue approximately twelve percent of all orders on the problem , but the Tesla boss does not believe .
its argument : the challenge at the ambitious growth target is not on demand , but on the production site .
Tesla has supplied around 8@@ 4,000 vehicles last year .
all models are expected to be joined by 2018 - 500,000 one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are only 1,800 reservations per day .
who can now order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; at the earliest after the second half of 2018 - if Tesla has created it to drive its n@@ ag@@ el@@ new , nor in practice tested production lines with maximum load capacity .
many experts doub@@ ting that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the non @-@ binding may be a problem to the Tesla problem .
because then the company cannot be able to stop un@@ satisfied customer in dro@@ ves .
EPA chef P@@ ru@@ itt moves down the rules of the Obama Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he had been compl@@ ained of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , began to delay its earlier decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era , to reduce emissions of smo@@ g caused by air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to change the needs of the state environment against re@@ ac@@ claim faster than previous destruction .
he did not mention the complaint against his previous location in a Federal Court of Appeal .
it is a term that expired on October 1 for states to comply with the standards of the ground@@ floor ozone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced that in June he will delay the observ@@ ance of a year to study his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid to im@@ pe@@ de in local decisions , or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump of Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable period of reliable environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block@@ ers or delayed , the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels have been contra@@ di@@ cted .
the ab@@ rupt change from Wednesday is the youngest legal notice for the P@@ ru@@ th@@ regulatory Roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA t@@ wal@@ ter has exceeded its authority , as it tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitoring and reduce methane de@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt presented that his K@@ ehr@@ t@@ wende was simply set up with ozone @-@ standards just simply the read@@ iness of the EPA for cooperation with the States due to the complex process of tim@@ ely ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe on a regul@@ ating procedure , and we take fri@@ eze .
we also accept the law and authority , which there is to us . &quot;
nonetheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ de eventually under@@ took his &quot; claim to delay and all other legal framework available &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available articles . &quot;
Republi@@ can Congress in the congress on a more comprehensive new version of the ozone rules .
a bill of approval in the last month shall be delayed by a minimum of eight years for the implementation of 2015 rules .
the measure was not made to vote in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , led the coalition of the states that the EPA in this week said , the group intends to just@@ ify the legal pressure .
&quot; the return of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New York , who are affected by the Smo@@ ke , who flow@@ ed directly from the Smo@@ ke , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penns@@ yl@@ ka , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil ozone arises if pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refin@@ eries , chemicals plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the Anci@@ ent Smo@@ g can cause serious problems with sensitive respiratory problems and contribute every year to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of the public health sector and the environ@@ ment@@ alists enjoyed an unexpected course change over the course of the course .
&quot; it &apos;s in@@ wor@@ r@@ ying , how much pressure it takes to get this sen@@ sible step by the responsible for the protection of the air that we in@@ hal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological clo@@ ister of the Tr@@ ump government to tackle environmental cont@@ am@@ ers and their particular interests . &quot;

according to the document of the document , at the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the impressive parish church , there is also a splendid courtyard , to which the church or cartridge was right and not vice vers@@ a .
so people lived there .
just as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt in 1858 , beside the lower village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still recogni@@ z@@ able in the area of Tum@@ lingen . now , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the domin@@ ical sett@@ lers of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 are fortified these historical conditions .
this cartridge law originated from the early medieval mon@@ ary law .
one Lord , who built a church , came and remained with a priest who remained the owner of this church and could also be inher@@ ited .
this was the right to use a priest or bishop a new priest .
there were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the size of the two cr@@ ush@@ es on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was then used for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be released during World War II in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years War ( 16@@ 16 to 1648 ) the windows were carved and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 1796 French troops were near the church .
they broke the pul@@ pit and church mill out and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to enter 1809 .
until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwe@@ iler .
in 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the tower was left .
in the year 1834 a storm was dismant@@ led the ste@@ ep@@ le tower and the half collap@@ sed .
to avoid an evil , the tower was demolished .
only the still existing tower @-@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ em from the &quot; Schaff@@ ner Rent@@ ers &quot; became the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organizer invite friends and incenti@@ ves of tum@@ ours on Sunday , July 16 , the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us chapel .

Verein wants to test permit from wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ bel themselves &quot; is no legal pre@@ condition for the construction and therefore turned aside to the Coun@@ cill@@ or .
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; takes ur@@ ged &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette even no wind turbines can have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only exists at the town border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone exists .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible , at the same time , the concentr@@ ating zone also causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
different zones are supposed to prevent &quot; inheritance &quot; of the landscape .
a few days ago , the city four had previously approved a second wind power station zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette - but they had not approved the Düsseldorf District government , due to a lack of form@@ ations .
&quot; due to the lack of planned regulatory requirements , the author@@ itative evidence is due to un@@ lawful and therefore to und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly , &quot; Christoph Er@@ kens , chair of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; goes down . &quot;
up to the current state of things : in front of the summer break the Wind@@ concentr@@ ating zone once again decided upon the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette ; a approval of the District government is still standing .
Er@@ kens : &quot; in this place the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the breakdown .
for the past week , &quot; the corresponding writing has been made for last week during the circle Four , &quot; explained a speaker .
the circle takes it to the occasion of testing the matter again .
however , they are not expected to make sure that the procedure will be stopped .
with a look at the ongoing proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to express itself at the arg@@ um@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ em &quot; . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette , the building of four ever 200 metres high wind turbines .
already last year , the company , which is indirectly involved in the town of Vier@@ sen , was closed on lease contracts with the owners of approximately 65 hectares .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all fourth households .
NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sens city council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a shar@@ ehol@@ ding at a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ berg district .
car and tractor together : woman dies with terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ ing and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn Circle ) .
a woman was fatal .
two further people were slightly injured .
the state road remained blocked for hours .
following police officers , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old boy from Bor@@ ni@@ ch went with their passenger car in the context of the accompanying driving with their 53 year old mother when accompanying the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealers plan &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ ers and people from the region should re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the business club and the municipal administration will take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the inhabitants for shopping expedition in the city centre .
as the chairman of the industrial association Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend will im@@ print the customers that offers the own city away from the usual supermarket goods .
planned is therefore a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprenti@@ ces@@ hip positions .
in addition , the shops of the city centre will be able to invite you to &quot; mit@@ ter@@ night @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en . &quot;
the promotion has not only destinations in the inhabitants of the city and the closer region .
in preparation commercial spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the special weekend , Christian König .
municipal administration and commercial association can co@@ operate with the Chamber of commerce and industry .
the commercial association and the city go to a further stage of the &quot; attractive city &quot; project .
this includes new deals as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all the business operators and hosts to move them to active participation .
the attractive special offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment on this day are part of the concept .
customer potential or re @-@ opened in addition .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many loc@@ als would have lost the city center at one &apos;s sight .
at the end , all of you would need to revi@@ ve the city center - to rent the rental of all the city and clubs .
so , with a network that had to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy that did not grow in part , king in spring had said .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen called for the first five Thuring@@ ian cities in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , Germany .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ ano@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ m@@ mer@@ da , Heilig@@ enstadt and Bl@@ eich@@ er@@ ode .
the day should &quot; recru@@ it &quot; for the appreci@@ ation of local trade and its importance for the collective of our cities . &quot; so I go .
the promotion under the au@@ spices of the I@@ HK and with many partners can also make clear that every citizen can be able to influence his direct environment itself .

Tr@@ ump wag@@ ering lights from telephone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts from telephone call between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 Tr@@ ump ur@@ ged Tr@@ ump in a telephone conversation with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , publicly to say that he would not pay for a scheduled border wall .
the US President dis@@ appointed him because he had made the wall public . according to report , he said to him : &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall in the southern border of the USA , and swore to pay Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ Bull have also been published and contains an un@@ altered exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ Bull said that a trade for the USA refugees trying to assume &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; st@@ up@@ id , &quot; and that the existence of the government would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said to the Gra@@ il in the beginning , &quot; that is the most pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury launched a crowd of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and r@@ ump@@ ed to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which could reach four black passengers and one white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a striking strike - took a long train to its cig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside sh@@ aking the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get it from the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es the silence , when a young black man was broken off from the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a reproduction .
but when a sn@@ ares are thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of them are thrown away in the audience .
since 2005 Civil rights are returned to the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , in which two black couples - Roger and Doro@@ thy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey from K@@ u Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been charged with the murder .
&quot; it is really strange that no one person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our par@@ ishes , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in the organization of post@@ ing .
&quot; it is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of State Georgia and a life of civil rights .
for him it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that it has never been corrected .
&quot; we want prosec@@ utions , we want the completion , we want to cure cancer , but first we need to get justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we can not get to Healing and Re@@ conc@@ iliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a bill , a blan@@ ket over the bodies of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne &apos;s victims , took place on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files created by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding lands were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ Process .
but no one was charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , Citi@@ zenship , the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch &apos;s actions in all the city was always known : politics and Sex .
in April 1946 , the Supreme Court of Georgia made its vote for the first time in Georgia to complete their vote in the summer .
about the same time like the election , according to the FB@@ I of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks told the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester was slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Doro@@ thy and that the baby , which she bore , was not of her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to bring Mal@@ com from prison , as the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Doro@@ thy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when she was removed from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b round the car around .
&quot; as it emerged , Har@@ rison , who prepared the Mor@@ de , has already made a FB@@ I report .
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a con@@ spi@@ racy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the mor@@ se , pro@@ claims and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it more intense .
&quot; it was a vot@@ er massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and vote , you will happen here . &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ and@@ ra &apos;s Gre@@ ene has led the annual re@@ launch of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , moving and is justified in a kind of deepest rac@@ ism , that many believed that he doesn &apos;t exist in America .
it &apos;s hard to look , and still more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are con@@ fron@@ ted with what is con@@ fron@@ ts in us , &quot; said they .
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to or hear what I have done . &quot;
the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - into a space and loud , called Gre@@ ene a well @-@ played overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ et Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chef @-@ C@@ lan@@ ted member since years , but he said that the role would never be easier .
&quot; I feel very dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story to life , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who are playing Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett h@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ col@@ m , the ester was scre@@ ened and pressed him , that he slept with his wife Doro@@ thy .
&quot; I said , n , he dis@@ appears out of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ den the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in a der@@ ision .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the worst .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; he asked them .
he is al@@ armed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still k@@ ich@@ ever .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think the white people back then &apos; n &apos; --- &apos; said &apos; .
but , though , one of the other black actors .
&quot; you need to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
and just there is the energy in space , a feeling of camera body replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is engaged to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of memory to the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona the N Word says , he says it sharp and with a re@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this repet@@ ition expi@@ res and quickly .
there is cry , pe@@ as@@ ps and then silence .
a woman , clothed with a dream dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and leads to &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; .
their voice breaks out in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen visitors swe@@ at and tears out of the eyes .
the audience is distributed equally between black and white .
a pair consists of I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street .
all the nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as afflicted humidity , when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the Mor@@ de has remained an A@@ ne@@ c@@ d@@ ote , but now if one stands on the same land where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels felt .
when the last marks of the song , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and to insp@@ ire the dead bodies .
children dance to their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ed each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy , when he wanted to remind of it .
after a few minutes there is Gre@@ ene &apos;s amount - and suddenly there is over .
the actor throw the Lyn@@ x we@@ dge and w@@ ren@@ ch their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man on train that played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ cona surrounded two of his co @-@ players and breaks down in her arms at the emotional load of the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of women .
&quot; we know that it is not in your heart .
you did it out of this reason . &quot;
later the audience starts together with actors together .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta stim@@ ulates a white pair with a black pair , which they just knew .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski fought to find words which left the performance .
&quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people come to come , which like you look and what they do , because they look like that , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks courtyard keeps the farm at his desk and reminds about civil rights .
he said that he had begun to plan the performance of the next year .
&quot; the order is inspir@@ ing in a certain way , because she describes the terror of what we have er@@ ect , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s so if we &apos;re not going to learn from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not know his own story does not know who knows its own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; go@@ dd@@ ham@@ mer@@ ing &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ ery in Bayreuth
even in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , Director Frank Cast@@ orf features a bun@@ ch @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e production in front of gigantic , six @-@ story back@@ drop .
the swivel stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) is an optional street corner with the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ sts &quot; logo from GDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes @-@ vintage car , in which the Rhine k@@ ills as a rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
oil dispens@@ er remin@@ is@@ cent of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - Money , Power and Gi@@ er - that moves through his &quot; Ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhein@@ ish - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
according to Stefan Vin@@ ke , Stefan Vin@@ ke ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , dis@@ car@@ cer@@ ated in the boot space and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the del@@ ight@@ ful of Hagen , which surro@@ unds the A@@ ura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he proposes Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) must also believe .
the audience than@@ ked the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
stor@@ my , F@@ oster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who is hum@@ bled in hum@@ orous and the hands towards Merkel &apos;s space .
big appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the big heat again in Leg@@ erer recre@@ ational clothing .
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam label .
in 2013 , he had still to leave the Pfei@@ f@@ Concerto for himself , five years later , in which the last &quot; Bu@@ h &apos; were resting .
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejoiced for it .
&quot; it is stated that the audience has grown together with the ring in a certain way , &quot; she had just said before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience do not only have a form of peace with cast@@ ors , but it was also an understanding for its vision .
I draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as volunteers
they work in their volunte@@ er year in several places .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : normally in stone courses in the furniture exchange , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked on the open day at school .
how are your experiences with that ?
quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , a late volunte@@ er volunte@@ er .
how does it come ?
quantity : I made high school education .
and then a construction engineer , let &apos;s say we have successfully demolished .
I have known for me that it is for me that I want to do something else , and I want to work with people .
and then I asked what are you doing .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe even , really .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I am going to start my studies in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably working in the Youth Office Her@@ ne practice a social worker and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not quite unusual , while volunteers create several different areas of service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it is well always where you can make up his FS@@ J .
one can do it from ageing to youth work - in all possible facets of the social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was partly in the middle , so in the afternoon support .
this was the right thing for me to ger@@ min@@ ate me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really expi@@ res .
differently than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well , here it is not about to pay st@@ ati@@ ds .
one has always gone down other people , each of which have a very different story behind .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been picked up from the family - you always have to go on it .
very interesting .
and you had no contact fe@@ asts ?
quantity : for this I am not of the guy .
it is a sphere that gives a lot .
lots of love , plenty of kindness .
there is also a negative moments , but this is that way .

EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ning the delay of the Smo@@ g Rule after Kl@@ agen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to prevent a regulation of Obama administration , repe@@ aled , which states that the States have committed to breach the smo@@ g resulting emissions . this was carried out a day after 15 states compl@@ ains the agency because of the stri@@ de .
the EP@@ O announced today on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Regulations 2015 , &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency to co@@ operate with states .
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and to that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA chef Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement .
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA , in which the ozone @-@ regulations - in which are to be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions , to determine where they must be made to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , was filed on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to re@@ tire a wide range of environmental guidelines , former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , the efforts have triggered the decline of the Democrats and nature groups that concerns about the impact of larger emissions on public health .
the EP@@ O website says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , the ozone does , contains &quot; the lung function and strengthen the respiratory symptoms &quot; as an example as@@ thma .
Joint Meeting in common areas
at the end , the decision was clear : the establishment of a joint space for the community of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tures decides to set up a community living room in the future adult population .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing plot is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it is still going to continue until now the church &apos;s church has grown in the community , yet there is no planning permission for the project by a private invest@@ or .
there is a discussion within a common space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat are offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor there would be a living space - around 55 square meters - and an ad@@ joining terrace with a 70 square meters floor space available for a special price .
the administration and majority of the council are h@@ ed before , such a common room not only look forward as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ish living room , but open to the church .
as an example , the word of the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
the decision that by the provision of funds for the current budget is already pre @-@ decided during the autumn of autumn by means of funding .
the construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be reported that T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent rise to 30 percent .
the decision can see to signal to the invest@@ or , that there is no bil@@ lets between legs and legs - what is similar to the surrounding areas - as well as semi @-@ roof - what the height @-@ height reduces and the construction of economical - would be possible .
unnecessary , it doesn &apos;t mean Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously passes the panel .
not as easy as a joint room .
Daniela B. Daniela is refers to the many own building , with which you are not so far away , as a result of a common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I do not make me to do so . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger speaks for the joint space - however absolutely against a municipal involvement .
she sees behind a conce@@ aled payout to coh@@ er@@ able or even foreign investors .
that &apos;s not the case , because with the acquisition of the area you should not grant a grant , but get a real , in the case of doubt , the counter@@ speech is to speak .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers request to submit the decision to the decision , three advoc@@ ates will be awarded .
so , with two votes at the original program , Stefan H@@ aller will summar@@ ises : &quot; if we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step , reaching a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

hiking in the Harz Mountains of Star
in the Harz Mountains , the nationwide &quot; star@@ ring path &quot; is set to emer@@ ge .
this is the idea of the &quot; Observatory of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
there is a planet in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
members want to stop the bars along the planned route and inform you about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
in the first phase to 2018 the association &quot; well @-@ reaching installations reach five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ quiries come to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ e@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
information on the tablets are to be supplemented by the Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception is a role in the location selection .
accessibility is also a crit@@ erion .
later the train path should be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path you will learn to know more about the audience , for example above the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the club .
in addition they learned , why stars have different colors , or why a star was stronger than another , although it looks much more distant .
also , in which constellation can be found in a selected star , and when he is best to see .
the Club has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg as early as 2014 , the highest nearby ob@@ servatory in northern Germany .
the site in the middle of the national park , according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , belongs to the six dark regions in Germany .
often there are the Mil@@ ky Way galax@@ y far from there and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y far from the naked eye .
in the Uni @-@ City there are something similar to the plan@@ et@@ arium initiative since 2003 , similar to the planned star@@ ters - the planet .
beginning from Geb@@ b@@ ard Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory and a &quot; exit &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community glasses ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the bars with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ related Pl@@ u@@ to on the end point - are precisely positioned at the distance and scale of one to two billion euros .
the earth sh@@ run@@ k so on a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter while the sun is exactly 75 metres away .
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometers .
during the light from sun to the Pl@@ u@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to mount with pl@@ u@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are so faster than the light in the world .
the march to next fixing is to last a half year .

they demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o right .

whenever they are prepared ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o as &quot; a huge fighter , &quot; and he will eventually take part in his Saturday @-@ battle .

four Last to tire plat@@ ters
an accident on the A7 were injured , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after first information , the driver lost a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16 : 30 before the junction of the market , presumably after a tire plat@@ ter , probably the control of its vehicle .
the car went to the right into the ar@@ ks , where he survived , and then remained on the roof in the gr@@ ass@@ y attack .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously wounded by the accident .
during the first power supply by the rescue service , the A7 in direction north was closed to the north for an hour , then the traffic on the left @-@ hand strip could be buried at the accident point .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; triple chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hop@@ ing for 2 : 2 to the season open@@ er to Braunschweig that optim@@ ising the formation of def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first season in the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , since there were not the two oppos@@ ites at the 2 : 2 in Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .
the turning chain is also to be further improved in the Erz@@ gebirge .
and a gate after a fre@@ ek you don &apos;t want to get caught any more .
&quot; it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will not constitute a line on line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team even better in preparation with the turning chain in preparation with the triple @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we inter@@ act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is certainly sure , &quot; because we are straight on the three @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; pre@@ condition is , but we are even better than harmon@@ ize and we do not aff@@ ord such a lot of inten@@ tions . &quot;
of course Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; if you cannot speak after a mis@@ carriage of a mis@@ sil@@ ently start , I don &apos;t know .
the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; if we stand on Sunday with four points and on Sunday , we &apos;ll certainly be able to talk of a regular season open@@ er . &quot;
of course , his trainer wanted to know nothing .
&quot; the start into the season Be@@ ads only after six to eight players , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not want to talk about an advantage against Au@@ e , just because the game of the Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident .
&quot; now they can begin the season almost with a home play , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e could perhaps be something fresh , since they could have no serious and complete play like Fortuna against a asc@@ ension into the bones .
&quot; but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inner def@@ ending of Fortuna .
the guests arriving from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday to the En@@ counter at last ( almost ) of the stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we throw them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is only a positive defeat against Au@@ e from nine games .
&quot; there are no team in the 2nd division , which one must beat from the out@@ set , &quot; says Fort@@ resses &quot; coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be met ar@@ ro@@ gant and super@@ bly &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ analysis tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subject to a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not every person believes on the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Re@@ quired Express ) initiated the test of tests last year .
during the asylum process , they will take a look at the estim@@ ation of the age ( migran@@ t by the Swedish migration Authority ) due to lack of the correct age of some refugees who were min@@ ed .
up to now Mig@@ r@@ er@@ shortened 6,@@ 880 was sent to testing cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency reported that the person could possibly be 18 years or older .
in 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson , by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results were stable in the past months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged over 18 years , doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has gel@@ ded over his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it was 4@@ 42 cases to propose that , that the subjects were 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det out the 5@@ 81 results published , they noted that in 243 of these cases the person said that it would be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , at the X @-@ ray photos of wisdom teach@@ ings and MRI images are being analyzed , which are then critic@@ ized by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ized in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ kr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institut , whose work comprises the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were earlier or later than usual by the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .
the biological age to assess this way is very un@@ certain .
if we can &apos;t say it , we should not do so , as if we could say it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
however , G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of an adult is un@@ properly assess , small .
the greatest risk is , if the person is under 18 , in this case these are approximately 10 percent . &quot;
full in Plan
the work on the three bridges of the Highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well ahead .
on Wednesday a seven @-@ ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern edge of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Building Manager at the Department of Transport and Transport in the government &apos;s chair@@ manship of Freiburg .
in April the works began at the same time in all three renov@@ ating bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to .
the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , which is dressed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
she was built in 1900 .
in the meantime , like the two other bridges , it now has come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve and respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long respectively .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge .
this is a dirt road that is also used as a business way .
the southern part of the bridge should be fitted with a width of 2.@@ 20 metres .
the pedestrian walk@@ way should then go on it .
the particular thing is that it concerns finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been equipped with the patented bridge coat .
a special finger@@ tips has the removing of pipes through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable connected to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed of the project through manual bal@@ lot over the project .
in addition , fish and canc@@ ers had to be f@@ ished out .
for the bridges between the building site and the collective in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic con@@ trace is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher Office entrance is the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; in the area of the bridge .
the cost for the three fires are 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ old in protest at German potato salad
it is not so often that parties go to one strand , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , everything else is hard to bring with a hat .
the parties represented in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag volcan@@ ic Parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a wide alliance that invites peace@@ fully on this day because the Af@@ D is in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell to a poster &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start brings - as Alice Wei@@ del , which forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the Vice @-@ Chair of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already before the event in front of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ developers but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the city @-@ pic@@ nic was originally planned under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now place on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful image that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum A world and one of the decisive organizers , is really nice : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; ur@@ anium potato salad , which could not eat the Af@@ D , &quot; says the woman whom he brought him .
the police ordered many civil servants according to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly in the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how is the Af@@ D actually came to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ ro@@ vul@@ can@@ fel reports that he strug@@ gled for such an event and get a supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ n@@ ers@@ dorf initially lived in Dau@@ n , but there a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch not enough parking is available .
so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes are pleased to announce that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
overlooking the event at the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz Square , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
this also makes it : at about 20 o &apos;clock , on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , including the Rhineland @-@ pf@@ hal@@ lic Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ s Uwe boy .
in the hall , some 200 list@@ eners , who are waiting for the elections for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to keep their words .
unchanged is the police point , but so far the civil servants had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , guests on the court &apos;s site have a longer breath , but also there is just after 21 hours .
the Police can fail - no special inci@@ dents .
trumpet meets trumpet
a re @-@ hear with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ists Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is there in the row Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ osh tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; hits a classical German training with roots in the wind music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchestra .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ rom@@ p@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both combines the desire , not only crossing the limits on their instruments , but also the limits of the various gen@@ res are mer@@ ging .
it sounds like Johann Sebastian Bach under the two like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &quot; World Music &quot; inspired by Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ re@@ ist@@ ern N@@ ils W@@ ama , mix classic , jazz and the free games to a fascinating entire art works .
this piece of the program was first performed in Spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ah wrote it &apos;s written for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with its distinctive acou@@ st@@ ics is deliber@@ ately drawn into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I want to try everything , &quot; So Kri@@ sten Stewart has quite openly about their bis@@ exual .
&quot; if I guess in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood celeb@@ r@@ ities were the &quot; T@@ wil@@ ight &quot; colleagues of Robert Patt@@ inson , who ultimately went bitter .
despite all this asser@@ ted the brun@@ ette title towards the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I was min@@ ted .
or do you believe , I &apos;d have played it ? &quot;
after their separation he was Kri@@ sten to bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed the du@@ alism forever and seriously .
so it has never been conf@@ used or ham@@ mo@@ red .
I just never liked to be taken seriously . &quot;
it was particularly among them , according to &quot; B@@ ang &apos;s bi@@ z , &quot; but in the school time she loved as a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really doesn &apos;t hurt me .
when I was 11 , the children , I would look like a b@@ b .
I really felt attack@@ ing , fri@@ gh@@ tened and dam@@ ned .
now I look back and think myself : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public will not love her love to live : &quot; the people expect you to become a certain way and ref@@ uses to off@@ end me .
and perhaps they call me some und@@ ou@@ dy but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify themselves before the whole public . &quot;
the Govern@@ or of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic Govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening on a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have been removed from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayer and lot of feelings ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifest@@ ation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; he added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump said before a HU@@ GE announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice won &apos;t endor@@ se the democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is only one million@@ aire in the state according to Forbes , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes stipul@@ ates that he possesses coal em@@ ins in five countries , and inher@@ ited from his father a carbon store .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee announced an explanation on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow for a democratic party , which would be more likely to work as it would be great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 g@@ ou@@ tw@@ ements and the check of the f@@ ew@@ est mort@@ g@@ ings in history , the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice is only the last ref@@ usal of a party that is not able to find a positive , positive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel spoke in a statement on C@@ BS News .

despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress met in November 2015 , after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) references to state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought , it was a very open answer today , a very hon@@ our@@ able presentation , &quot; Mr IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e told the repor@@ ters .
&quot; the entire Council and the whole Congress were delighted about that the Russian Federation has experienced itself , that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to make sure that the Federation is redesigned . &quot;
CO@@ E said that Russia is also pleased to announce that Russia was accept@@ ing the criteria for his re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constru@@ ctional day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that it is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the gui@@ ding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athl@@ ete from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will begin at the athlet@@ ics world championships , which begin on Friday in London after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re@@ inst@@ al@@ ert .
threat@@ ening tests are still ongoing and forbidden train@@ ers are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
mour@@ ning for Mali cancelled soldiers
at a fun@@ eral service in the North Hall of Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people were thought of the two on a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security .
for even un@@ explained di@@ lap@@ se , Defence Minister Urs@@ ula from the Ley@@ en ( CDU ) did nothing .
they called the two different pilots than the &quot; C@@ ert@@ ner of its expertise . &quot;
&quot; we tend to have accomplished the highest sacrifice in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; explained them .
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old rod from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and transferred on Thursday accompanied by a death @-@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er cathedral St. Peter .
at the lunch , only the members of the Church took place in the church .
after that the fun@@ eral in the circle of the family , closest friends , began representatives of the German army and politics .
among them were H@@ esse Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the Deputy Secretary of the Armed Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the mour@@ ning mat@@ ures come down , the relatives and arm in his arms were on the edge of the noise .
in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on canvas .
the Defence Minister of the Ley@@ en received the converted soldiers as &quot; highly decorated , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff was built on the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and had been one of the first six trained tiger pilot of his reg@@ iment .
there Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach , Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the Reg@@ iment , said : &quot; if this crew couldn &apos;t turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doub@@ ts on the United Nations mission in Mali did not show any ministers from the Ley@@ en : it is dangerous .
but he was also of great importance for a country that we only separated from two states , &quot; she said .
after the fun@@ eral service , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not contain any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave in addition to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried in his wife next to his wife .
this was divided the Royal House on Thursday with .
traditionally , the Danish Royal Navy is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard prepared a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the queen was understood with the decision of her husband , and called his name in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not forget the intention to become buried in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a H@@ ehl that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would glad@@ ly become king .
in 2016 he retired from retirement , and he also puts the title &quot; prin@@ cess &quot; .
since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and the function that he wanted to see himself in his wife not as equivalent - even not after the death , he declared L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , Chief of the Danish king &apos;s royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old man is ultimately un@@ clear .
but he did not mind the intention to become buried in his French hom@@ eland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ ate , son of a French no@@ bles , had learned Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ eth@@ ations of the people always imp@@ aired , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 years of control .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik expressed over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , so@@ cks , instead of stro@@ kes , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ om I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and the fame of them to be the brand new intellectual intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope to see corruption .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
there were two mist@@ akes ! &quot;

Th@@ ings@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government has to decide whether they could continue down@@ gra@@ ze in this situation without majority .
Stephan Weil , however , is essential to be indisp@@ ens@@ able that the country &apos;s day resol@@ ves rapidly .

Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect against tox@@ ins , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about ver@@ se@@ u@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ and@@ al happen ?
how can consumers do .
Federal Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer and consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp to the stamp .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states will provide the latest information on the eggs affected by the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs are out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance was not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the Länder .
however , my house immediately has un@@ locked and has since dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s data in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has the same as the manufacturer to ensure that the sold products are able and health harm@@ less .
if you have exceeded the resi@@ stances of 0.000@@ 5 mg / kg , these are not traffic .
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time is not to bl@@ ame for businesses .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the ze@@ al@@ ign knowledge , the production plants have no immediate debt .
rather , they must count due to mut@@ ually illegal intern@@ ships of service companies with economic damages .
as always there is too little controllers in the harvest .
only on the staff or even on the def@@ ective jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls who revealed the process .
however , the truth , however , is that food @-@ grade and criminal energy could never be excluded at 100 percent .
as a result of this , a consequ@@ ent impact of such proj@@ ections and hand@@ over to the Prosecutor in the cases where off@@ ences can be found , of crucial importance .
I have already made a lot of several times that I expect a bridge to the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm system really needed for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get safe and sustainable food products .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer consumers and consumers are fal@@ sely affected .
by the company &apos;s funding , manufacturers , dealers and consumers make a situation that absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal application of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ pro@@ il on the attitude of food delivery animals is not removable and must be informed prom@@ pt@@ ly .
it must consistently be consistently al@@ working on all levels and with high pressure .
I expect from all competent authorities to clari@@ fy the fact that the atomic fact is rapidly growing .
how to carry out the financial rules of football to Ne@@ ym@@ s to Paris
the rules , which aim to avoid un@@ suspended expenditure of the European football , are not distur@@ bing ne@@ ym@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain for the UEFA Europa , because the leading organization , which over@@ sees European game , has power to offer teams from the access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were called from the UEFA Europa in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G has to take sometime , that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without large losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to sell off the Brazil out of his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars moved to France .
PS@@ G can make money loose with safety so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar sign and bring him into a galax@@ y of other Stars , in view of the financing of the team through the energy rich ruler of Qatar .
publ@@ ishers may apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players a lot of money , but have to control the break @-@ even point in their way to the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs had taken on enormous debts after success , effectively che@@ ating and risk to ru@@ in@@ ct , when banks or owners were back up their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P repe@@ aled from the concentration to the debt of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model used the Roman Ab@@ ram@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested in order to build the crew and to build a global mark - to a har@@ der matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P plant , which runs until 2018 , clubs can go losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini fell by the presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to make a far off @-@ reaching spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , opposite The Associated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the N@@ ym@@ ar buy @-@ out cl@@ ause in a package case , it can distribute the amount of invoice over the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract , allowing the payment to be terminated for the next five years at the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million Euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 combined with Abu Dhabi , which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at the time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the teams for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players remain limited .
the UEFA is looking for clubs , trying to over@@ print their financial views by companies that are connected to the owners of clubs with owners of clubs .
while a cat@@ astroph@@ ic company can sponsor PS@@ G if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA dies would not apply to leg@@ it@@ imes .
it was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the country &apos;s value was prop@@ elled by the P@@ PE Tourism Authority in the world .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar on payments of the World Cup Committee could come to Qatar in 2022 .
but PS@@ G and Qatar has disp@@ uted that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM ambass@@ ad@@ ors will be simply to recover and find such a der@@ ive maneu@@ ver for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA will still be atten@@ tive to note each attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEFA had no preparatory convers@@ ations with PS@@ G via Ne@@ ym@@ s transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said under the condition of the an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss PS@@ G situation .
the final reports published that the PS@@ G 2015 / 16 had a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million and generated a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ ym@@ ars will be a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing @-@ Deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ k@@ ot@@ tos .
the association will assume that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing the signature .
the Spanish league was definitely ir@@ rati@@ onal , one of the best football player to see , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ s departing from having claimed that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars at the official owner of PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ Manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the pre @-@ stop of La League against a state that financed an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the past 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways , or have different interests , if a country has a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sl@@ ate sl@@ ate
in the past few years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y onboard @-@ chocolate has been produced for the Swiss Life .
now , the kiss@@ es co @-@ operation in front of a possible end : the airline writes the contract again .
Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; on request of the newspaper &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
the airline will close a new contract during the first half of 2018 .
all products would be inspected every two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman .
about 17 million small red @-@ white chocolate boards are distributed to 14 grams a year before landing on the passengers .
over the cost the Swiss Life wanted to do no information .
industry experts estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieved an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but import@@ antly , all@@ em@@ al is the advertising effect : a pre@@ stige manufacturer is a pre@@ stige manufacturer .
how many applicants will be on the new press , the Swiss Life does not want to betra@@ y .
but in question , only Swiss manufacturers come .
according to the newspaper report Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the contract beyond the spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not able to reach a position .
cho@@ col@@ ates boards distributed to Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss re@@ signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut is delivered in cooperation with h@@ ug the chocolate @-@ tablets .
the possibility to place the logo introduced Swiss in front of two and a half years with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss cho@@ ices together .
on long @-@ hau@@ ling tours , customers of first Class with le@@ ak@@ y paintings are ind@@ ul@@ ged in the business class n@@ og@@ gi by Lin@@ dt and in the Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
on the short track , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class .

this repeat of history is also nost@@ al@@ gic because of the glorious days of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ years @-@ hor@@ ror era ( as the pre@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ old the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy , &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV rot@@ ten ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth Ban@@ ks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to greater things .
as a cultural ar@@ te@@ facts it is a par@@ ody and a em@@ bo@@ diment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era .
but when fran@@ chise feels it , the time would be short .
&quot; First Day of Camp &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly sur@@ pris@@ ingly well , not only because of its ab@@ sur@@ sur@@ ge Hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for a speaking tin of vegetables which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by moving to the core of the g@@ alle@@ ys - actor &apos;s medium @-@ age children play @-@ up children who are growing - they created the im@@ possibility to win the final part of the W@@ itz@@ es back .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now adults , is less emotional and his par@@ ody is more emotional , including a reef to the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &quot; s , like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand showing the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at a point a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite More@@ au ) still not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost its vir@@ ility always .
and there is still a further mad @-@ mal@@ icious plot to be included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see young young Mr. Rud@@ d who will see Matt D@@ ill@@ ons under@@ li@@ pp@@ ings of &quot; Singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy joined himself as an old Kn@@ acker .
these are the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness , who could heat this fran@@ chise like a kind of repeated conclusion : &quot; W@@ ET Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; the last scene will show the band as she is going to visit the premiere &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now remin@@ is@@ cent of another kind of nost@@ al@@ gia : on the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his East @-@ against @-@ West Ring I@@ con@@ ography .
the com@@ edy by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created com@@ edy with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as a director , there is a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , au@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main transport - a hard @-@ ch@@ urch@@ er , and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , with the di@@ alog@@ ues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt is synchron@@ ized to English .
it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ alle@@ on to see ( the police takes the time to check out chess in TV , like Americans may do it with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides the voice out for an independent game &apos; fin@@ de &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the truth of an und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly prop@@ aganda @-@ drama - a mur@@ derer , which carries a Re@@ agan mask - is that it often plays as a single st@@ agan mask .
for six long episodes it moves away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; that was posted to a lower length could be better , because Gregory and I@@ os@@ ef has always been able to visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two strong males , who swal@@ low a bun@@ ni@@ es of Hamburg .
the message for the imag@@ inary public audience is that Western culture can do everything for a money .
the fic@@ tional Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own more recent history and with the ih@@ lava .
blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ eb@@ eil , Constance , Esslingen and Stuttgart were looking for numerous objects , as the prosecutor &apos;s office in Constance ha@@ sted on Friday .
at the age of 25 aged between 25 and 77 he was arrested and issued warran@@ ts for arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the officials introduced larger amounts of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
two people were arrested during the same raid in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
therefore , the two are probably extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany .
in the promotion , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
a total of more than 300 police officers were deployed .
the members of the Mafia organized drugs @-@ crimin@@ ality , severe violent acts , kidn@@ apping murder and rob@@ ber@@ y and comp@@ res@@ sive disorder .
already since the summer of 2016 , the public prosecutor found coll@@ ateral against organized drugs in the South German room .
between the prosecutor in Constance and Palermo , an exchange of exchange and the investig@@ ators of Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the large insert on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four civil servants in Palermo .
the vis@@ or of investigations carried out mainly Italian citizens with respect to Italian Mafia .
even a incident occurred on 27 May in the morning , several shots have been fired into a restaurant at the early morning , should go to the band &apos;s account .
way compl@@ ains big g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner register
&quot; data from citizens that should not arise &quot; : a report shows the fore@@ igner register in Germany significant short@@ com@@ ings .
the lead to part serious mis@@ decisions by asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee management of the Federal Government of the German Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , told a media report to large g@@ aps in the Aus@@ län@@ der@@ ric register .
short@@ com@@ ings of the data that registered data could lead to part serious fail@@ ing in asylum procedures , in a analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; will be published .
according to the regi@@ sters , ten million people are recorded with a foreign nationality , including $ 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data is not adequ@@ ately cared for , the data quality has not been well done in parts .
in all cases , data were found from 1921 , &quot; by people who have long since become longer live , or of citizens , who have become German citizens and actually no longer appear in the regi@@ sters . &quot;
&quot; def@@ ective data inputs can significantly slow down back processes , &quot; it says to the report further .
in the statistics on the travelers of travelers , the EU citizens are considered to have not to travel .
but such false assign@@ ments introduced &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on the dealing with out@@ breaks , &quot; therefore , it is therefore in the analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began to return refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to Italy when they arrived from there .
this is from an internal paper produced by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; Neue Osn@@ ab@@ sent Newspaper . &quot;
in the paper , this means that B@@ AM@@ F conduct these procedures &quot; regarding families with children - except for infants and infants - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , practically no longer possible , the newspaper in reference to the difficult situation is on site .
after the Dublin @-@ Convention , it is responsible for the refugees of the EU state that they first reach them .
when a mig@@ ré travels to another EU country , this state can send him back into the country .
on the basis of the basis , the Office now write : &quot; in the meantime the admission capacity for families with minor children increased significantly in Italy . &quot;
Italy have provided for the recording and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold these additions to sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees as part of the Dublin Agreement .
the internal affairs committee of the Lin@@ ks@@ fra@@ ction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ized this decision : &quot; families with children threatened for lack of defects in the Italian asylum system of human rights . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulations about an increase .
the Bank of England war@@ ns that economic growth &quot; contracts &quot; will remain when she retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened print .
with 6 to 2 in this month , the political decision makers of the Executive Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates on 0,25 % , because the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase in weak economic growth .
the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2017 and warned that pressure on households would continue to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest rate would be necessary to breeding the inflation of Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that the loan should be expected to rise by more than expected to financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ oth economic package that was published before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ ite .
it will require time for the financial plan to al@@ locate the financial budget for banks , although it was said that it is now expected to make 15 billion pound more in the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds Sterling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , because the pressure on the real one of households will continue to raise the consumption . &quot;
in interest rates , she repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; to cooling down inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; size would be expected to expect the markets .
the markets showed the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank , however , emphas@@ ised that increases gradually &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank forecast down@@ wards ended down@@ wards for this and next year , 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the previous year .
it maintained its growth forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the most recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have increased expectations on a interest rate and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months rose to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it &apos;s easy to recover by the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered a little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and a slight wage increases , as the dis@@ appearance is even worse before they become better .
she added that the monetary policy in the coming years cannot be &quot; preventing , &quot; but she added that wages grew significantly &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to weak Po@@ unds , which will compens@@ ate a part of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes to a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ ct .
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank to interest rates , the call was increased after an interest in interest , because inflation increased the pressure on hard to hard @-@ ur@@ ged households , with three political decision @-@ makers requested to rise to 0.5 % in July .
the inflation in the past month rose from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months .
the Bank said that its aims at its aim at its goal of 2 % is to be &quot; entirely &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds .
Andrew Mont@@ dale , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ ise Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortest response in s@@ wap rates , mort@@ gage market is likely to be stronger again , since the credit or credit is expected to end in a positive way .
the market is especially well suited for those who deal with existing deal and make the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many are always popular with toll @-@ free options and low rates . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Organization ) disp@@ oss@@ ess 10,000 people from disp@@ uted HIV @-@ drug
patients will be received from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in N@@ HS access to a &quot; transformed &quot; HIV pre@@ venti@@ onal treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one prior to sexual intercourse ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients by around 86 percent , now supplied by health care via a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he declared ready to fund the trial , after the Appeals Court confirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court in the past year , under which N@@ HS had to pay the powers to finance the Pr@@ EP , in spite of the asser@@ tion that local authorities should use it .
the Chess Federation announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ chief Simon Stev@@ ens as an important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) known as &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool , and She@@ ff@@ ield will be one of the first to be eligible for the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October 2018 in the whole of England .
pre@@ op@@ positi@@ onal hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine which are taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP was significantly reduced the HIV transmission in infection end@@ anger@@ ed .
Pr@@ EP in front of intercourse means that enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent a HIV infection .
such medic@@ ations can be taken every day or so 2 hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to question in question , ule school , bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners , who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ds and individuals who controls a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and registered in a hom@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines in this week according to an international competitive price .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ EP by being applied specifically in a large scale , implemented and implemented in large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great intervention must be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to en@@ act and over@@ take HIV .
it is a further milestone in the progress of being one of the biggest health challenges of mankind in the more than three decades .
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if specifically al@@ igned to needy and end@@ anger@@ ed people , the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England , to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled , and not associated with a partner , which leads to the many of many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must be carried out now that the study will quickly be carried out throughout the country and that no one has left the risk for HIV .
now , since the Pr@@ EP Test@@ ers has been designed , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hod@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ health minister , said : &quot; at the beginning of the Pr@@ EP trial , after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government is welcome and over@@ due .
the evidence shows how to transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention and ending the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this test leads us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it &apos;s important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it is estimated to reach an step closer to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society .
the big life live : mezzanine and cle@@ ver designer tricks do this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a big house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it &apos;s located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before that I was living in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown in Ear@@ ls Court in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
I have been in love with them and made it a special offer on that day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhau@@ led completely .
originally a single room estate with a finished layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne reservoir and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , much light .
that was my request , &quot; says it .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , to create 12.5 feet high ceilings and a home which was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to place one another , so that the architectural challenge was on to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
it had to be creative thinking in order to solve the task .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explained .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms that they were stack@@ ed to each other , without that we had to g@@ aps to us .
it was not just therefore to build an easy platform , but set the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window by retin@@ vi@@ us is looking down over the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
silver furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays an role in adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to work for longer .
the kitchen is mir@@ ro@@ red as a window into another room .
at the entrance , inter@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all the cutlery and j@@ acks of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a smooth space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folded kitchen are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of steel rein@@ forcement , vene@@ ered MDF doors .
&quot; it &apos;s important to it , so when you push the door , very easy gli@@ des . &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or like your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , a real estate company will occur and carry out a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here they have made it to enlarge the floor area and at the same time high @-@ quality materials , which pro@@ cure its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create a emotional engagement in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t hide yourself into the electric sockets inside the walls .
they are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that the apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square meters of something that can be transformed into something quite mark@@ edly .
in fact , such as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this .
brethren fight for $ 500 million in real estate agents for an US $ 500 million
two decades emerged after their Italian family founded the d@@ ynast@@ y in four decades , in a strug@@ gles because of one of the largest real estate agent Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their assets should be broken .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp con@@ front@@ ation over the separation is held in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers 38 property totalling more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded there and grew at a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
the property has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city district rum , the town areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping centres in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with their de@@ ceased father , Colin - from Paul was described as the main operator and the dominant personality &apos; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one @-@ third .
a ple@@ dge is said that Colin made property valued at $ 316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the distribution of property and cash is tested for Paul as Pro@@ bl@@ emp@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed tours , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers also strug@@ gling for control of the existing shop - which Colin , as Paul claims to be excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but raises Paul before , some owners in@@ competent .
in an early fri@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Colin , he says he hope to stri@@ ve the battle .
&quot; my Italian Legacy writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides of the law firms .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants , the dairy bars and delic@@ acy transactions from the late 1950 @-@ ies and in the early 70s one business in Br@@ uns@@ wick bought .
they took the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Colin opened the first je@@ ans of the family in Colin .
Colin tells that he began to West Africa as he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their property to their sons .
&quot; Luigi told me often that he never wanted to land the brothers before the Court , &quot; wrote them .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is group , with Colin claimed that Mark was paid when leaving the company &apos;s 10 million dollars and hat@@ ch 26 million dollars .
in Luke as well as Mark , Paul tells about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has turned back to Colin , although he was a former AF@@ L manager and was the best friend of the TV stars by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire in 2015 .
Fair@@ fax Media recorded with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers in contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is .
only Colin made with SMS to say &quot; I can really say much to say , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; it is very , very sad , that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and put our family names through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the judgment that he tries to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted that Paul and I would like to present in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he was still looking for a solution . &quot;
on Friday the hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin .
Tr@@ um@@ ps is planning new Chief of Staff to restri@@ ct the media ab@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can do it really .
if yes , it will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the head on a consistent course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met in his first working day with executive employee , he presented a major problem in president Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House which he wants to create : poor information that come into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the staff to flow information about it - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions when he would get good information . &quot;
wa@@ its diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to count Tr@@ ump to monitor its media device .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television dates back to decades - and now where he is in the White House , its TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; when the Tr@@ ump is due to un@@ fair coverage it was productive to him to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs , &quot; said the former election campaign manager Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom@@ ary under control , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media use a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter are ever &quot; under control , &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps these campaigns are some know what we do not know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets without their inter@@ ventions could contain more types of ignition without their inter@@ ventions .
probably , we will never know anything about the Twe@@ ets that the dump is not sent .
if his collabor@@ ators make it a lot of times , trouble did not hold it , then their effort was worth the effort .
but no one has consistently avoid that Tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y can be found .
a part of the problem exists that people in a White House that are composed of competing parties , are always trying to present their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump material , which may promote their views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - quite busy with this history - reported about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors to benefit from the President of strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press lines , especially such with dam@@ aging le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts to find out where these origin@@ ate .
just this happened at the end of February , when someone claims a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source of being at the White House in the White House .
even though Johnson had banned from Twitter because he had offered no concrete evidence , or that it is no concrete evidence that he comments on false accus@@ ations and rev@@ oked her .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to inquire at the staff of Wal@@ sh . &quot;
in addition , Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff of Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to control and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove itself as a effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and its consultant still continues to influence .
these indisp@@ utable factors make the wa@@ iter mission very difficult .
master@@ y Cri@@ min@@ als get Post of Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the aid of the population will pray and hopes for this .
the police distributed throughout Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to the escape in the flight .
since the addresses of the requested s@@ bur@@ gl@@ ars are un@@ familiar , they are hop@@ ed from the population hopes to pray .
Europ@@ ol reported on Friday the action which follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar from winter .
the experience could have shown that many vol@@ at@@ ile due to holiday dest@@ ine , was called Europ@@ ol .
I compiled 21 postcards covering selected bur@@ gl@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ov , more than 2.5 million times this viewed .
36 of the online voc@@ alists were able to have been arrested , at least eleven of them after publication on the website .
Travel@@ ers negoti@@ ating over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; million@@ th series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est home owner of West Mid@@ lands have tra@@ ded with some of the travelers on the ends of war , which have tra@@ ded a field in front of their family homes .
the trav@@ ellers have their 20 caravans on a field outside a we@@ al@@ ous road from Soli@@ h@@ ull road that is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies , and an army of transport , after they had been thrown out in May , without having gone down from a council excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their accidents .
the tak@@ eover group found a gap in the defence plants and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ ob@@ stru@@ cted to find a way .
the inhabitants of Soli@@ h@@ ull chose the advice of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said that it is &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous occup@@ ant said : &quot; they are pulled there on Monday evening after they were re @-@ sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they were thrown onto the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced through Sch@@ am to the implementation , as he was using the problem when dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ ellers were there in May , and they moved back now .
more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to move around to protect long sub@@ missions to protect your parks .
I live on the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my local fee if the Council cannot stop this . &quot;
a local residents , who would not be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of these trav@@ ellers only to be spo@@ iled by another round .
the figures now increased for this time and has even seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person for Soli@@ h@@ ull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the route brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary steps to pass it as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection , it is very important that as possible , as many residents of the anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour during the police , call 101 by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we do our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house prior to the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof due to the public ambi@@ ence of the company mbH about the 13th of April 2014 , some 30 000 overn@@ ights was lost per year and also proceeds through the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of a dramatic increase of refugees who came into the County , the hotel building as a collective accommodation was offered , which was offered for controversi@@ al discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by the installation of a building plan to secure the area as hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at the time in the Municipal Council .
but above all the Freu@@ den@@ stadt Julian Oss@@ wald did def@@ ended the hotel location and spoke at the time of serious interested people to the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ hotels with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ers bought the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at an voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the Group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ berg property .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ers and one in Bad Her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , since a longer time construction container in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , a substantial renovation work will be carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings to part dis@@ assembled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs out of the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
much to March there is much to do .
&quot; it &apos;s really a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the input range is modified , the new window will be installed .
all that would be &quot; nice &quot; close , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer ex@@ presses itself .
&quot; we want to make a piece of gem . &quot;
the pool , wellness area and meeting room are among the facilities .
not place in the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , emphas@@ ises Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wool is extended wide , explains sc@@ iss@@ ors .
groups or business@@ men are to feel at home in the hotel .
convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael K@@ rau@@ se already led , so sc@@ iss@@ ors .
the performances of the city are the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external plants are also brought on the front , which is clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant that is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Coll@@ ab@@ medi@@ ator sets a Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s aff@@ air around US President Donald Tr@@ ump is intended to be a special Grand Jury based on Robert Mu@@ eller according to a report .
the panel recorded work in the past few weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote under appeal for the people .
the newspaper presented the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the CN@@ N reported that there were already first inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have targeted systematically in the 2016 presidential campaign .
mu@@ eller is examined whether they spoke between Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men will be interested in elec@@ toral campaign as a consultant of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
in addition , Mu@@ eller took more and more dr@@ um@@ ps of private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
the Washington Post , &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the special medi@@ ator is personally put into the centre and sub@@ du@@ ed the alleg@@ ations whether the President viol@@ ated the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to prove this evidence in possible un@@ interrup@@ tions and decide whether it should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called for count chambers .
they are turned on when it concerns larger and controversi@@ al cases .
the procedure will always be closed behind closed doors .
the board can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to the hearing of E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were shown to turn the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
you should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ um@@ ps consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ aging struggle with Paul Man@@ at .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the obj@@ ections show that Mu@@ eller shall not be so@@ ber in his work , and that it should be necessary to act fast .
but it is not inev@@ it@@ ably hot that the Grand Jury will be turned on by the end to decide on the survey of an accus@@ ation .
nevertheless , the onset of the new phase of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern the concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new re@@ vel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening gave an address in West Virginia to present the Russia aff@@ air as campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the topic give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about that they can talk . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a statement that he was ignor@@ ant of the En@@ forcement of a Grand Jury .
but this also works in sal@@ ms , stressed that he stressed .
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special medi@@ ator on &quot; fair &quot; mode .
the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey had said three times that not to be determined against the president .
I have no reason to accept that something has changed it , the name was called in the explanation .
however , Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this alleg@@ ations , the accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump has become no@@ isy , so he would like to viol@@ ate the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to setup the investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is due to the investigation on a large pressure .
according to the presentation of US media , the White House collected materials against the special medi@@ ator and its staff .
which dis@@ band@@ ed spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
differently , as an independent special medi@@ ator of the Congress , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air around the later restored president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has created a position in which he theore@@ tically could be tax@@ ed by the president of the Ministry of Justice .
several transmitters of both parties want to prevent a step by step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic defic@@ its on Thursday bills , after which the special medi@@ ator could not be released more so easy .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg accelerates in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Arctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg from the barely seven times size of Berlin from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is solved .
the cer@@ eal Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Oc@@ ean@@ ic Research was distributed on Wednesday .
the one trillion tonne heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large Kol@@ oss t@@ oss well after the north and will probably take two , three years until he was melted .
it is with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice giant , the researchers have registered over the last three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
to what kind of climate change played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice , is un@@ clear after research .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual cl@@ ashes of iron pipes in the region , writing the U.S. Research Center for Snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a matter of fact .
according to many researchers , these can be related to global warming .
the fin@@ n@@ ul@@ ene Kol@@ oss was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is driven by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it is still growing on the sea and break off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
at the north of this shr@@ ine , the balance of w@@ axes and break down some few years ago .
a complete shot was cr@@ ushed there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge is never withdrawn as far as at the moment .
in addition , the ice plate stood under voltage and could be broken down , if you bre@@ athe out a slice at a key point .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg ex@@ alts a sea level , as they swim in the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melt itself .
however , the loss of the scra@@ p will make that the gl@@ acier go directly into the sea and far away much faster than before .
that could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a low degree , the British research project describes the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth largest shr@@ ink of Antar@@ c@@ tica .
at the foot of the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge of the free ocean some 200 meters .
it refra@@ cts from there regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural events and does not make any direct connection to climate change , the ice sheet is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the most notable retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed .
among scientists is controversi@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will return soon and may be mer@@ ging and perhaps together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man said and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though this researcher did not return to climate change this gigantic scra@@ p market , so in the past decades a very many sk@@ el@@ iness of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula are broken .
this long type of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends in South America .
according to data of the British Antar@@ ctic Peninsula , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula is covered by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase of temperature increase was contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula increased by around three degrees in the past 50 years , thereby fill in the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CDU intends front rate in the staff
because it is becoming more difficult to occupy , the CDU , from the German Emplo@@ yers Association , invites everyone to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , Kre@@ ist@@ ag has made 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the teaching positions are obviously very cov@@ eted .
approximately 620 applications were recorded for the places expected this year .
nevertheless , the circle far@@ es forward staff to cope with the higher requirements and tasks .
at the moment there are no vac@@ an@@ cies at the Circle M@@ ett@@ mann .
we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as forces in general administration .
the CDU aims to take the initiative in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag , together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and make war in administration .
management is expected to develop a concept for personnel and development in accordance with the desire of the parties . &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term conditions of skilled workers , but the future oriented of the candidates is said to counter@@ act .
the overall concept should be pointing to the inside and outside , concrete measures for trans@@ verse frames and include a education offensive , request CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds already after a good approach .
since the circle has to do with personal problems , which is not known earlier .
other cities promote good officials and staff and offer more attractive conditions .
we are talking about a real &quot; competition of public emplo@@ yers . &quot;
for this purpose , a high number of employees , the disease or age related from the service is leaving .
highest time for hand@@ leb@@ ars , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , president of the CDU , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he was long ago already in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ ist thick surprise when he placed the number of personnel in question and gave the rest of the parties .
nations would like to be reviewed all the possibilities sent to a withdrawal from the municipal labor association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to pay the CDU , employees and civil servants , the CDU , the employees and public officials were trying to enter into a public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , increases or more money is only if you change to a higher level , based on professional years .
but the tasks of the circle has grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ el Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy dis@@ car@@ ded the tone on NGO Mig@@ rants li@@ ars
in Italy , NGOs , the lif@@ egu@@ ards for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue to continue the new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs write no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can keep going on , &quot; Minister of Interior Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ nit@@ is warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , because of their team effectively collabor@@ ated with tra@@ ff@@ lers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the charity organization , which has been in operation since one year , refused to sell themselves to the exec@@ u@@ alties of the Italian national park Am@@ bro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , after we have collected all information and assess the situation . &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , who monitors the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
it is assumed that his crew can board infl@@ atable migrants to board them directly from tra@@ ff@@ lers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used to re@@ use their ships .
at least one such meeting was supposed to have been held only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the acquisition of the government , whose contents of Italian media has been published .
the crew is suspected of susp@@ ects over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves .
under the code of conduct boats have to have boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a to board an Italian police officers who supervised their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have now been ready to keep in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessarily but acceptable , as they had no significant changes or disability &quot; their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti also said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue work in Italy had strongly decreased , in the last weeks that efforts to strengthen Libya &apos;s coastal efforts and collabor@@ ated with local citizens .
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister .
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants attemp@@ ting to reach those countries in the hope of Europe .
Anst@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region for four days and enjoy the sights .
there were three taken Gu@@ ides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ enh@@ eimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for touring tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took over hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it was followed by observation points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the advanced levels .
between there , there were over longer asc@@ ents for the long Tri@@ als .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s festival market .
again the look@@ out point rises to the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
at the last two days , many al@@ ti@@ meter were added again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and tra@@ ff@@ lers brought welcome breaks .
the B@@ iker in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ met@@ en opened the B@@ iker in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ met@@ a .
also Neustadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had learned the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - league equipment for E @-@ sport
sitting the sport @-@ stars in the future of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating with wind and weather over the stadium to fight ?
fact : E @-@ Sports is long ago to become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ings inclusive .
this also revealed the first German alli@@ g@@ aver@@ ton to eng@@ age increasingly in this area .
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg won the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later with the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded a e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to insp@@ ire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Management Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
it is certainly , &quot; that on this train , it is still going to rise again . &quot;
at the coming weekend the FIFA World Federation organizes FIFA in London the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified .
also Robin D@@ utt looks great potential in the E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now has a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football must be min@@ ed in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that the young people go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : in a temp@@ ting , all possible markets , mainly the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could far be present online by more often on these markets , than once again in the year the federal lig@@ aments to Asia .
why is it exactly ?
when the E @-@ Sport will play computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the football @-@ simulation of FIFA in competitions .
long ago , as in normal sport , Li@@ gen have been established , in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and with Asia , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but are there a correct sport ?
for many , the introduction of the future is secure .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ otic also has inter@@ sec@@ ted with the question too .
for the professor at the German Sports@@ - Academy in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reaction , which can also be found in classic sport - for example increased heart rate issues , stress reactions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
in addition , it has cogn@@ itive performance , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast responsi@@ veness .
professional gam@@ ers should not only be at the console but also exercise their physi@@ que and take care of the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte Player is a good player . &quot;
f@@ rob@@ otic also provides problems : &quot; d@@ oping is always more an issue . &quot;
controls are difficult in online games , and in the scene , the structures of classical Sports are missing .
the researchers have a positive impact on the integ@@ rative effect of E @-@ Sports .
players are international on the road , which is like a big global family , there is no intercultural shirts .
a study of the corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) states an rapid growth in the E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , primarily on advertising , spon@@ sor@@ ing and large tournaments .
in three years , sales will be around 130 million .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros in the soccer league , this is too little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far away from the other established sports cards such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte &apos;s consultant .
many countries are already far@@ med .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball h@@ ill@@ age Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez is participating at the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sports Car Company Uni@@ que .
a lot in Europe also does a lot .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ sport had been introduced as a teaching class , says F@@ rob@@ otic .
in the Netherlands and France , the football @-@ first league @-@ Ver@@ a has now been obliged to set up a e @-@ sport department , according to D@@ utt .
&quot; in the European comparison Germany , &quot; V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann explains . &quot;
to fall in nost@@ al@@ gia , and clari@@ fy the ancient times , today it is no longer enough .
it is therefore necessary to preserve the tradition of the Society , but the company is set up on the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in an digit@@ alized world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; I can &apos;t hold it from it , only while football will remain , as it was always . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , sentenced by Conrad Roy to suicide in prison ,
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years old because she encour@@ ages her boy@@ friend and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 months , will spend 15 months of their convic@@ tion behind bars and five years were exposed to proof .
on 13 July 2014 , Carter was sentenced by his death on his cas@@ ual killing of Conrad Roy .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is innocent .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to stay free until his appeal .
she had been con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argu@@ ed that both them as Mr Roy had suffered from a psych@@ ic illness .
in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter faced with tears in eyes , with folded hands and down@@ wards , when she was condemned .
&quot; their actions have been killed by Conrad Roy , &quot; said the Prosecutor &apos;s attor@@ ney .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; said she .
&quot; it has no Reu@@ ter . &quot;
but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney said that it was a &quot; awesome surrounding which they have completely regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said that he did not find out that their age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even her spiritual disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a Prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the promised that there is no day when I didn &apos;t pray the loss of my dear Son .
I want to be proud of that he is proud of me , and how I go with all . I try to bear with all my pain , which we are for eternity with us , for his sisters there is it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ el@@ yn Roy , said that she will be prosec@@ uted by the knowledge &quot; that she never would never participate in the wedding of her brother or would be an a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; no more this one person to have , with which I was together since my birth , is a pain , whom I will keep for the rest of my life always with me , &quot; she said .
the case seems to be a lawful preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to claim another committed suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide po@@ is@@ oning in a vehicle .
in the case , national attention turned to itself , after Car@@ ters reveal his messages that she encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; hands formed on , spring from a building , make you living yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .
in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad , and &quot; everything that you must do is to change the generator , and you will be free and be happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter sought out his attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any doub@@ ts .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
to the few that Carter def@@ ended , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted of murder on her British fellow worker in Italy , was acquitted when he was acquitted two years ago .
Ms. Knox , 30 Years old , published a Com@@ ment@@ ary in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserv@@ es compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua had no co@@ incidence at the Audi Cup at the Audi Cup , is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winners a great season to get paid extra motivation .
something was different in the cabin , that saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the additional dress piece is very , very small .
but as far as far as wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , no Philipp Lah@@ m , and no Manuel New , was not a new Manuel New , he made the link to the arm .
&quot; the trainer did not cover it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bayern captain .
well , the stand would have better run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Nap@@ oli .
but the sign of the Coach I was able to suggest that too .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal has been in the age of young artists , debut , and just chosen from a holiday with professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player leader , but he .
sug@@ l is distributed to those who want to keep much for those who want to keep in the mood .
those who then chose the legacy of Lah@@ m can only use a small extra motivation .
K@@ imm@@ I confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to do as a player : responsibility &quot; .
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old te@@ amed up as a mini @-@ l@@ ame about the field .
right behind , this is now its position , the white Bin@@ de at the arm and the rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this start @-@ formation as the one who can take the Ru@@ der on the best in hand .
he gave instructions , tried to turn the un@@ finished troops .
he had the look for the whole , while many others were busy themselves .
Vi@@ dal to play his missing fitness ( didn &apos;t work hard ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches sent to connect to the achievements of the Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ ds also only conditi@@ onally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver thus did not drop to their first performance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ bes .
this was just fine .
Sü@@ ver ran next to K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y in front of the army , both ag@@ ulated sou@@ theastern .
the characteristic of Nap@@ oli was often heavily damaged , and the sw@@ elling also tried to play a few times .
his colleague Rud@@ y gave us that the result was &quot; not so , as we hop@@ ed for us . &quot;
but he also showed a regular performance at the debut .
gaming action , speed change : &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot;
as usual , these Bayern world still looked for the new separation , one looked into the game .
for example , Rud@@ y was not one or two , but determin@@ es six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i passed away after a few cris@@ p statements in his new co @-@ player .
there he list@@ ened to an interesting movement there , &quot; what happens here , I &apos;ve noticed now .
in Bavaria , you just need to win any game . &quot;
after all these things , he must not teach the New Testament .

company satisfied with Rhineland @-@ nurs@@ ing minister : the Economy commen@@ ds W@@ iss@@ ors Tempo
it was often un@@ reconc@@ iled , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Grün@@ e ) nor Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is reflected by more than one year , in which the new Minister of Economics Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
the Cham@@ bers and enterprises from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and calls at the same time the old Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Know ye the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has blocked . &quot;
the biggest lif@@ ec@@ st@@ ice looks like Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is in the pri@@ or@@ it@@ ist list of the country .
even this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 is scheduled to stand out .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the west surrounding Trier , which is listed in the pre @-@ penetration of the Federal Navigation schedule .
the objective is to take up the route in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ speaking Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us provides a sign for regional , but international con@@ cur@@ ating company .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) are committed as by Wis@@ sing , at the wine a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to improve sales in the supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports since ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish a dedicated company , the Chamber of Commerce .
in the new Master Bonus , the Trier Hand@@ werk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional incenti@@ ve for young trainees , managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the full championship lead and 2500 Euro if graduates within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
the hom@@ e@@ work list for the country is however long .
at the scheduled road building we can quickly make facts , at the same time it commands the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Glock@@ auer , main managing director of the Chamber of Trier .
of 56 new engineers , who wants to adjust the Wis@@ dom in the state business sector , so far only 29 places were occupied .

Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers con@@ fron@@ ted with a counter@@ action
one day before the announcement of Audi announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW , the company said that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as a limited liability &quot; and moved on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is resident , to stop or restri@@ cting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced that there were three million Mercedes vehicles to be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines will apply as car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , installations to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gas emissions from diesel vehicles , also take what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ignore the powerful car companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could adjust the use of so @-@ called auto @-@ alt devices to adjust the regulations when a car was tested , but returned in normal driving conditions .
several employees were charged by Volkswagen in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be charged in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi has been involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities have accused of delivering a system to circum@@ vent emission regulations in Europe , and an enqu@@ iry into the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation might be very difficult to test the Volkswagen engines : the luxury car manufacturer has over propor@@ tionally in@@ proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ g@@ less dum@@ b and laugh@@ ter against the laugh@@ ter
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most popular Cart@@ oon Dra@@ fts@@ man , the not@@ ices of his figures have been the trademark .
also with 85 the Argentin@@ ian still represents and works in a film .
his message : laugh@@ ter , &quot; for there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immig@@ rants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he led himself among others as a char@@ ner for bl@@ iss cards - what was fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the fortun@@ ate day of my life was the day when lost in my job , &quot; he said again .
following stops in Lima , New York and Paris in the late &apos; 60s the breakthrough : with the release of its Cart@@ o@@ ons in Paris Match and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
ever again , the artists were inspired by cities .
large , rund@@ ful Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o characters carefully st@@ roll in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he also sat on his own information today , today on the drawing , works almost ten hours a day .
about calendar , puzzles , books for large and small , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favorites and watches are still much dis@@ sem@@ inated worldwide .
for six years he also has been working on a animation and a TV series with its figures .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los arbitr@@ ary animal in its drawings - which has a centi@@ meter as counter@@ part .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will reach 2019 on the movie wall .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o .
the script is not written by him .
that is why it uses more to the TV series , which is produced on how its original drawings , wor@@ t@@ less is produced .
lav@@ ender based on climate change threatened
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change .
the Lav@@ ender is remin@@ ded because of the lack of d@@ rought , and because of the disease @-@ related insec@@ ts , scientists and farmers that are trying to find solutions to find solutions , big head@@ ache .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effective effectively , because the plant spent much less rain in the past few years , and in the fall much more .
this has impact on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ ja transfers , and with very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and it is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil bl@@ acks not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also known for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; rather than long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
to the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and evap@@ oration of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to drying .
the town of Ge@@ isa is celebrating its 1,200 @-@ year anniversary .

the killing of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ den@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ esdays , in order to review their plans for coverage of the youngest chaos within the State Sin@@ alo@@ a by which organized crimes , corrupt civil servants and un@@ audi@@ ble drug wars .
but on that day , in the shade of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high ranking journalists discuss what saf@@ er feels : they are going to take their children with the office , which were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades , or at home in 2009 .
security experts have written three words at a panel on the front of the room : opponent , Neutr@@ ale , ally .
they ask the repor@@ ter , name for each column - no evidence is needed , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdom@@ inal feeling .
there are drug tra@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists that are suspected of standing on the sal@@ aries of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of publ@@ ishers who make the chaos of Mexico .
there are no glory of violence , and while in all the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , there are more journalists : at least 25 , since then President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto had taken his post in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are subject to attacks and thre@@ ats under federal protection and so far there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter , their editors and the inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs .
his lack is deeply impressed , although its presence is present - a great photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the façade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ter in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ barra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show its sm@@ iling face with glasses or typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ter discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although the Special Tribunal for At@@ tor@@ ney was set up in 2010 to process the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated .
as with the ten thousand of Mor@@ den , which are connected to drug trading and organis@@ ational crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only sel@@ dom charged .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still consist of treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ tr@@ ater@@ ly and although the terrain is now even av@@ eng@@ ed .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting with the discussion of safety , says I@@ barra .
&quot; it is very st@@ up@@ id , to turn my time in this workshop &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we know not the why we are mist@@ rust . &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was set in two men . it was shot out of his car and 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve River . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius was gone away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ours along to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but for the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing as silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition in the United States in January was become Sin@@ alo@@ a to one of the most bloo@@ dless batt@@ les@@ ions of the country , since rival fac@@ tions are strug@@ gling to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is filled with pan@@ elled , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ages for drug may , which are bigger than many houses for the living .
remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cardboard control over the coastal area with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States has .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the d@@ angers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the fault that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two ab@@ normal@@ ities have contributed to the murder .
at first , in February the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ eting ant@@ it@@ rust fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may be denied those sons , as soon as they bought the edition , as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second fault was to force Val@@ dez not to force , after the sei@@ zing of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country to its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survi@@ ving that his friends and colleagues said that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars in hol@@ dings .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without at the smoke po@@ ison problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
in time the newspaper proved to be a reputation for the bra@@ ve and hon@@ est coverage , and sales and advertising recorded .
repor@@ ter lo@@ dges it , hard @-@ throw investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody would deal with anyone else .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ fi@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors &quot; Cab@@ ot Prize , &quot; for its coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage to defend the Mexican drug history , where they always led them .
he gave himself up that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to keep alive , &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J @-@ Award .
drug trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a , is a way of life , &quot; he said in October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV .
&quot; you need to take the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak , who was flu@@ ent like a do@@ ck@@ lab@@ our@@ er , the friend who was generous with h@@ ugs and rat@@ ers , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he always would go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and there always sat on the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to ask her own concern about how they can do their work on the best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like to act with their wives , their children , their little shops , their home and run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of sel@@ f@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ maintenance .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
when it sm@@ ells wrong , run away from it .
the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be dis@@ appointed ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot;
the old rules , how he and others say they are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative in@@ oc@@ ytes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees arrived from Ri@@ odo@@ ce to safety training , suddenly there were no mobil@@ es allowed . days previously announced that sp@@ y@@ ware that exclusively sold to governments to the monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside the heat , two polic@@ emen kept protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) inside a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in Pur@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who are considered not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago , since the repor@@ ter have gone into the mountain landscape where the drugs no@@ de fac@@ to are under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has roasted on three main stories .
it was the assassination of the brother of the former Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é for the state spending that focused on the home town of the Govern@@ or .
and there was a group consisting in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about that which was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so it was attention when it was time to write what each in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally run by drug hands and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a polit@@ ician who ruled the Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , who ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of corruption .
in Vill@@ ar@@ real , Vill@@ ar@@ real prayed the repor@@ ter over previous inci@@ dents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went out to a military attack .
only a few months before , the readers of Val@@ dez visited the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the ab@@ duction .
&quot; earlier we did know what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its stream@@ lined body nature .
&quot; all channels of communication with our sources are broken up . &quot;
the Val@@ dez office was added to the storage room for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers , dedicated to the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something that they had never expected to say : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ b a few signs and passed on the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalists to the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
an burned body was discovered and civil servants say , based on DNA tests , that it is his .
in all the country , journalists were stronger when they had written in organized protests by S@@ OS Press . &quot;
on that day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez was gone into Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with Govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez acc@@ use the authorities to explo@@ it journalists and to kill journalists because they said the truth .
she has therefore asked that she is again divided by the government , because she is concerned that her rage does im@@ pover@@ ished their obj@@ ectiv@@ ity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organis@@ ational crimes committed by the government officials and a constant society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drugs , but also on the orders of politics and security forces that were organised with organized crime under a ceiling .
the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; presented more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they would like to hold the mouth , &quot; he said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
apparently , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no man forget the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as 6 years ago .
their body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones next to their separate head .
some stores have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others do continue , as El Man@@ ana was born in Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of its Director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed to the drugs box with an editorial article on the title page with heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and search for d@@ angers .
and sometimes they are h@@ un@@ ted , as evi@@ d@@ ently the photographer of Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 together with four women in a residence in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ barra who once wanted to be po@@ ets , is that the drug tra@@ ff@@ icking off him .
&quot; Mexico goes to Hell , and therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ sia close to the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ p .
a series of shooting stars with band@@ ing ri@@ vals and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as it was promised by a number of cart@@ el @-@ messages in the region .
from the border stone , you have published news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce about mobile .
the front page had to be changed next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ats near to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were in will@@ ing@@ ness .
if they were afraid , they did not show them .
among the huge portrait of the fallen green of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employee of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed its traces .
&quot; how can you do only remember , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day was murdered on the same day when the intern was assassin@@ ated , she asked to send them to the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to soak up his enemies .
in the first sight it looks like a statue , even if a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
now , researchers have found that the first findings of an incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros in a Canadian min@@ ers have been well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his fl@@ ak@@ y skin was of red@@ dish Braun - and they said that she had had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
the report in the &quot; Current Biology &quot; published him as the ad@@ mon@@ ster@@ ing Pan@@ osau@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
the F@@ ossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly good preserved condition has researchers that it really describe as &quot; really remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , it is the best preserved fossil fossil species in its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he appeared in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine close to Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he arrived at something that appeared from the ambient rock on the plateau at the circuit , and decided to look more precise .
this fossil discovered the F@@ ossil and was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to expos@@ e the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground .
according to all these hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you tw@@ inkl@@ es only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has been slept , &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is visible .
&quot; it is represented in the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant stress , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , and resem@@ bles a wall @-@ changing tank , probably threatened by meat f@@ ress@@ ant din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly t@@ illed din@@ osau@@ rs was a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves in front of smo@@ kes , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology which is known as the counter@@ sh@@ ading which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to avoid his enemies , experts predi@@ ct what was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creative creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has first made head@@ lines in May and has now been seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and studied at Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli in the museum engineer Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible by Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of sheds and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the shaded shaded , a widespread image method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the conv@@ ocation is custom@@ ary , the results are sur@@ pris@@ ingly , because the size of the magn@@ op@@ el@@ ta size is far beyond the living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased by enough pressure through meat @-@ stress din@@ osau@@ rs , the evolution of the con@@ front@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the conv@@ ocation - think about R@@ ehe , Zeb@@ ras or ar@@ qu@@ ail - are much smaller and viol@@ ate as a prey , what is sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong Rau@@ b@@ tier behavi@@ ors on a massive , strongly ge@@ ared Din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ bes have had been to have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs is red brown .
scientists will continue to examine the animal on critics about his life , including its preserv@@ es in order to figure out what it did as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river , fell into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor .
at that time , Alberta were as warm as south @-@ flu@@ ori@@ da , and rivers and oceans probably spreading much further inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really interesting because it is completely covered with preserv@@ ative skin , but also in three dimensions , and the original form of the beast ret@@ ains , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal today looks like in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period .
you don &apos;t need to use your imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ em@@ itting di@@ odes , fl@@ esh@@ ing din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , the earth was stri@@ pped .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the t@@ abled din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased by some of its fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ ef@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings were published in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta died after death in the sea and f@@ um@@ bled in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn funk to the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine close to Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the extin@@ ction of the din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely covered by mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures had an average of 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and spent up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that were ra@@ ged from his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the t@@ illed plant stress was sh@@ em@@ ulated by the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river is floo@@ ded into the open sea .

the remains of this special specimen are so good that the skin tre@@ ad still produce woo@@ ded tank panels along the din@@ osau@@ rs .
like Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preserv@@ ing so &apos; rarely like a profit in the Lotto .
the more I see it , the more effective .

in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ ted on the A8 : many injured
serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous land@@ marks , a short distance of clim@@ bs and g@@ aff@@ er .
at the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , around 20 people have been injured during the end of Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , at 17.00 hrs between the inter@@ joining Order Adel@@ zh@@ ausen and O@@ del@@ zh@@ ausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also lor@@ ries .
about the exact number of injured reports did not contain any information .
it would handle light to moderate serious injuries , said one Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher .
a large super@@ charged on li@@ fe@@ asts was addressed to the accident .
the A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich there was a ten kilometer long retreat in the direction of Munich .
like a AZ repor@@ ter , it also occurred on the opposite track to massive disability - by numerous g@@ aff@@ ers .
the Fire Brigade quoted the label of the vehicle len@@ ders who now have to calculate with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 there was still a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group tester &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced at once : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
returns the Schaff@@ ner and wake a uns@@ af@@ ft or strike the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of the breaks are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing free ticket control .
one confirms simply by mobile phone that it is taken to its place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , there is a trial operation on two routes .
&quot; if the offer goes on , we extend it .
it is expected to be available in many other distance routes in Germany from the beginning of next year , &quot; said a Bahn speaker .
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called the bahn Card dev@@ alu@@ ation without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to be able to use them , some pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what you &apos;re already doing most passengers already .
in addition , it is necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient way of ticket sales .
and last you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works : one gets into the train , calling out his ticket under &quot; My tickets &quot; .
with the test customers then an button for electronic recovery is released .
the access components can be found on their mobile devices that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located on the train and has taken the booked seating area Y .
comes the train atten@@ dant with the ticket control to place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already enclosed online ticket .
you can keep going on , continue , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the subway - which again is to use the passengers .
&quot; who wants to travel without ticket control through our train@@ ee crew , checking in the DB Navigator just yourself .
this enables the passengers to create their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB remote traffic .
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to go to individual customer requirements . &quot;
those who often walk , knows that besides delay and missed trains , the ticket control checks are one of the largest off@@ ences .
for often , in any case one of the travelers does not have any documents necessary for the use of online tickets .
either case the credit card or the number of identity card or otherwise a document needed .
the consequence are endless discussions between allow@@ ances and passenger , which leads to poor mood in the part or greater and del@@ ays in the control of your own tickets and will take care of the workers at the end of the time to worry about other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is only available on the ICE connectors at the 915 @-@ Stuttgart and ICE in Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked .
how a activists say the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l on August 9 , 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken .
only one day after having arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Past@@ or@@ ene was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ roll@@ te by Facebook on their phone .
she hau@@ te over a post from someone from High School .
&quot; the police has just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road &quot; , whose name was there .
conf@@ used since no one else had posted the information on their feed , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly ret@@ ched on their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he post@@ p@@ ens a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em physi@@ que , which was stretched out on the road and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; I thought Fer@@ rel@@ l .
but death was not new for her and their fellowship .
it turned their mobile pf@@ one to return to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive later on the evening .
there were photos of the police and people who cried out , and from one man who claimed to be a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
it observed a live feed at which a police station is in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with an in@@ verteb@@ rates .
in another video , she said , we@@ aned another police , his ri@@ f@@ le and crying : &quot; I will kill you ... &quot; animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and which we can typically tell us . &quot;
at that moment I felt sh@@ aken .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you made a return flight and went home next day to house .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she repeated her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary cinema , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th century .
it is a story of survival and Protest@@ es , the love and the power of power , strength and strength , which live from the perspective of the people living in the community and have filled the streets to ask answers .
when he@@ rel@@ l brought up with her daughter , who brought a flower dress and a right crown , following F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , discuss the two a talk , that they had countless times in front of this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you recall how I have taught you when black people have to fight for war on what they believe ? &quot; rec@@ alled her what she said .
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 year old boy , and that wasn &apos;t really correct .
I could not take her again , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you need to know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also know also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution , and what we must do to free to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck , you have experienced an experience in which she personally experienced no det@@ ach@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not unlike the next black women &apos;s child .
I have the feeling I would give it a bad service to keep them far off . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , considered the activists of the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter have joined a local partner , who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on protest@@ ers .
slowly a new kind of acti@@ vis@@ m started to take shape for fer@@ ment form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
a few weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l hit Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to document , &quot; what happened .
one question was Fer@@ rel@@ l in mind : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can explo@@ it ? &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
how fol@@ ay@@ an explained in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised up their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m rum @-@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l the project closer , along with six other native loc@@ als followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; was shot in the years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people will be represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
the goal was to focus on Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s experience - in order to show that it concerns a Messiah leader , but around a community , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she turned out to be the most open participant in the film .
as a consequence , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s life as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ter than she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; but I understood that at this work and when de@@ cent of black people need to give a certain danger . &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s history repe@@ ats the role of the black g@@ ay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media to identify themselves as g@@ ay .
&quot; black , g@@ ay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and thus we are fighting for various fron@@ ts .
black , g@@ ays women must bear the main load of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement is really kept of black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is no real type of action , &quot; which was chosen by fer@@ rel@@ l because of their identity as the heart of the movie .
&quot; it was the person who played this energy , she said .
&quot; it &apos;s not a co@@ incidence , although it was in front of the front because with a life of these clo@@ cks than a black , s@@ g@@ ay woman is so much on the game .
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
the news service in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long been disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the community and the police remains .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social awareness of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless they were committed to singing and she feels like a memorial to go to the street three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; size of size &quot; : TV readers discuss their bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although they are not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern part of the pedestrian zone since the first presentation of 2009 the population in fears and ad@@ versaries .
the subject leaves no cold .
the topic is also discussed at our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery : &quot; it would be a dream of &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be a real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi &#93; ) or quite simple : &quot; size of w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ate decides that a gallery attracts more clients to the city , of which the other business also benefit , fear the opponents that then the pedestrian zone is her@@ al@@ ded .
furthermore , the gallery is planned for the property where the farmers market stands , in which 13 Directors shall be mark@@ eted .
the construction is to be finished with the beginning of the construction work .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - including the Bed@@ a Square with the opportunity to sit outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the pe@@ asant hall for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the country men always liked very much .
we have discovered the but@@ chers for us too .
we would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there are also other cities in other cities .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if the market is mark@@ eted in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent is available .
the new project could probably not be low . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : what is the shopping place in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ ish or supermarkets : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous .
of course there are enough in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market there , it is more important that us remains at least the Mark@@ thalle .
for after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mainly offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ sol@@ ete .
as you can see , shop stores in a shopping mall only are rented out of larger firms , because the rentals are often not portable for a single retail@@ er .
too bad , special shops are almost no more and that , what else is left , will probably still disappear . &quot;
Wolf W@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the pe@@ asant market during the construction time ?
the old ED@@ EK@@ A would be the solution - even at duration when the bit gallery actually comes .
or does it manage the gh@@ ost bit gallery already to drive out all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it &apos;s just not work .
and a shopping center , which is empty , does not need any one .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real estate market , instead of this gallery .
but for a small market hall , there is no more space thanks to the mad@@ ness many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
when the pe@@ asant mark@@ er is made , again a piece of culture will van@@ ish . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , that are almost invisible , that depend on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ tro@@ up@@ es and Haar@@ lem created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the c@@ utt@@ ings from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ tics took a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison , having publicly called diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which opened on August 2 , is Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspon@@ dent between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has been transformed into technology , computer science , and art , and he was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only had three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that could be lik@@ ened from the gen@@ om@@ ic data , such as someone could not only be interpreted to the formation of DNA data - the many wise men as they can interpre@@ t and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ations of these interpre@@ tations , but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , born in Brad@@ ley Edward , but already spoke about the identification as a woman since her Pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convicted in 2013 because of 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the sp@@ y law , computer and theft .
by the prison the image was supp@@ ressed , so very that there was only one single photo - one piece of grain , black @-@ white be@@ f@@ ie , in the man@@ ing is relatively un@@ likely to a driver seat and carries a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde per@@ ate - it was associated with it .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of its 2012 @-@ project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot;
the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic Ar@@ te@@ facts like cig@@ ars and chew@@ ing gum , producing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press exhibition of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at that time and could not be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her m@@ apped M@@ use became un@@ ob@@ ese of Bri@@ eff@@ em@@ unden , who ruled several letters over the course of two years .
they had called even one of the Sho@@ ili Kan@@ at@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ lied images , &quot; which would convert a future when the President of Chel@@ ci@@ us would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama had actually only few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome way of happy re@@ union .
it is also available at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t of the government &apos;s bearing and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ eters ways , which he should actually fix it to escape .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the wei@@ rd tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen under a given reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery he called man@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic disin@@ teg@@ ration , whose basis gender , breed , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a centi@@ meter of Cs and Gs and As described in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg we hop@@ ed to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia of the artist ) , such as astonishing , at least in biological resp@@ ects , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous memories , is also visible .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a private room , is a page from the above mentioned com@@ ic nov@@ els .
it shows Mann@@ ing how it dives with a hands @-@ free arm in the United States at the United States like King Kong .
&quot; when they ch@@ ill your speech , they then won , &quot; says it .
&quot; let never stay the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist who gre@@ et her from Philadelphia .
&quot; I still can see it , if I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition - as it was predic@@ tive in the com@@ ic book - but when it should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room of m@@ asks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation , which is similar to hor@@ des of Protest@@ ants .
it was also aimed at all , as it was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) where the genetic H@@ ap@@ logs were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , &quot; said about the portraits .
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed along with Chelsea , as movement that were also behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a nationwide hunting of human dig@@ nity is a professor at North@@ western University and a staff of the University of Oxford which was susp@@ ects a susp@@ ect after a man had been found in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with dead@@ ly injuries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the District Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bul@@ ls .
a warning from the police was published by the Chicago Police Department that the ly@@ re was discovered on July 27 .
civil servants received a call , came to the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim of several injuries in his body .

the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of WA@@ DA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re @-@ use of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organisation .
according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing that could give to concern for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list stated that Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities reported the reported outcome of the study by the WA@@ DA approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren in publicly sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport .
regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system had an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no state programmes , and we won &apos;t add something that does not exist . &quot;
mut@@ at@@ os words agree with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office R@@ Sport in the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversi@@ al positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ conditional , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of D@@ oping sk@@ and@@ als from D@@ oping control in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the main course of the organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli presents that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved into the right direction , &quot; in order to be re@@ used again .

start @-@ ups that will help your company will not be connected to the next U@@ ber
A@@ my deliver@@ ance wanted to measure the luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent .
and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not do the process .
&quot; there was simply no consistency and obj@@ ectiv@@ ity , &quot; she said saving , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company .
she sum@@ mon@@ ed people from the outside .
a new breed of the Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the guard to help companies to find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licens@@ ing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to provide information , specialized groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow to handle the C @-@ suite exec@@ u@@ tives and turn right to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools of companies are used to measure employees .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has a better impression of what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and poll@@ s of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company , which shows most complaints and what managers are low degree results - so that you can boot out why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , in order to remain at the top of the workplace , which has been published in sc@@ and@@ als , since then a former colleague describes a blog post that has been discussed by an environment of Bel@@ äst@@ ings , with whom those who have spoken were punished .
for launch @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ po@@ ative business option .
the Global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth in 2020 , according to the finance technical site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the u@@ ber @-@ barrel in Mis@@ sk@@ ar@@ dit .
Conver@@ tible has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ tible companies can send customized &quot; pulse &quot; transfer@@ ring , confi@@ dential in real time and view the warmth of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hotline which can notify employees of bad behavior .
and if the main managing director is involved , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ tible .
if a company is found that his employees are po@@ or@@ ly treated or ins@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience precious consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers &quot; Flu@@ k@@ tu@@ ation and Kl@@ agen , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25.000 employees and over 500 sites , Conver@@ ged for more than a year , to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures , and have an easy way to reach its business headquarters .
earlier , if an employee would ask a problem , he had to find or send a single telephone number or e @-@ mail to the company headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a en@@ roll@@ ment and un@@ comfortable experience , told James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Coun@@ sel , who said it was not a good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees .
well , since the company Conver@@ ted Conver@@ tible , there may be problems that were previously identified by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ no@@ isy intern - faster and addressed .
&quot; I can come closer to these holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree visibility into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment policies . &quot;
companies began to re@@ tire eth@@ ics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of eth@@ ical cl@@ ashes because of the En@@ ron sc@@ and@@ al , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took up until the &quot; Social Media came to its right &quot; that companies knew that you didn &apos;t stop that their dirty clothes went online .
&quot; before the use of technology for the monitoring of Eth@@ ics , people used hope than a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ tible also offer your software as a service and loaded the company with recur@@ ring fees for use their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who supported both start@@ ups .
Conver@@ tible received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture Capital .
there is an growing complex of research , shows that today &apos;s employees are expected to expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only inserts .
the staff want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and G@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors can reach R@@ end@@ ites when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and involved .
when the analy@@ tics tools are third parties to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employees work is important to experts from the workplace culture .
but the data are us@@ eless when the administrator of a company does not take action .
indeed , when a company asks employees according to your feedback , there is a expect@@ ation that change is on its way .
and if the Shift is not fast enough , or does not at all , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments can be spe@@ eded and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the business management company Kot@@ ter International , the company has seen themselves to be very interested in collecting data .
&quot; for if you don &apos;t follow employees , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
will you take care of yourself ?
and whom you don &apos;t worry about why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who is now able to en@@ pass a monthly ear@@ nest @-@ surveys , was able to open measures on the same day when a problem is reported about g@@ lin@@ t , thus ret@@ t .
and after collecting the feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize several teams within the company to organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new in@@ sights on employees , and it hopes for a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose men lose also customer .
and if you lose clients , you will lose company .
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fra@@ cture
it runs at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footage looks on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ k@@ ot@@ ics and show the back full of silence of the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , they represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses are returning to their aud@@ itors , before they return to their aud@@ its before the next morning at 6 : 30 am to the Aquari@@ man Football Center .
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real T@@ ret@@ ta , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday .
N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the player , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 , to fulfil the already packed sched@@ ules of the player .
the compromise from the two days is more than a day , at which the brood started the beginning of Camps almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as during six times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are to hold 18 exercises during the course of August 18 . 20 before the beginning of formal play preparations for the start of Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ stands the control change of the N@@ CAA , even if they add many different routes of the players a further point .
&quot; we put these enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they took it simple , and they ch@@ op down , they are great people .
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices once the camp is finished , regarding the clear visibility of its fields by an adjacent park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of elevated class , which has already been covered with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective device behind a Tor@@ p@@ ec@@ ast , no slight task .
Bru@@ ins @-@ Player to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; that &apos;s a real problem , and it is not far taken to think there is a room for rent there and then set up there to record a practice .
if you have the video link from a practice , it is a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I &apos;m doing so very much wor@@ ried about me .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with Fal@@ sch@@ messages in fact sheet of third parties and their results in the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to detect possible folding messages and to send them to the fact that possibly results of the facsimile check out of the original article will be shown .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main share points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believed they have also influenced the US presidential election 2016 .
the problem is also become a great political theme in Europe , with which the French voters were floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany supports a plan where social media networks will be punished if they do not succeed , water @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook was in a separate statement on German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany launched a test of the new facts .
&quot; besides the knowledge of the fact that stories of fact , third parties want to be challenged , the people want to read and share what they would read and share , &quot; said Sarah Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook continues to test his feature in the article &quot; in conjunction with the items &quot; and works on other changes to his news Feed , to reduce false news .
create a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to see in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was a hat@@ ch for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his intimate River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ari@@ ah Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I think it was so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; says he we@@ ary .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist , Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , which he worked for the Jac@@ o@@ bin@@ s , &quot; he says .
&quot; that &apos;s his thum@@ b pressure !
and I always hit the smoke ; for when it was kindled a fire because of the light .
for som@@ ebody who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as he would also be doing .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so with old pap@@ rika , it is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be hon@@ est : I found my welcome party a little over &quot; ) , it seems all to be true to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and had spent the many treasures and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ enas of the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscapes , hus@@ band@@ men , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the staff just started to worry about the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , representing what had possessed : &quot; it could mean that land conflict would be bor@@ ing , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families .
boys , let all go to go ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to go on a wider basis to the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows the newly built castle , to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar , the 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the pe@@ as@@ antry arose in this region and I thought , a revol@@ t was a good start .
may the two be connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hid seven years during the British Reformation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is depicted in the 18th century by adding a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was only dug only after years later ) .
the Dar@@ re@@ ll@@ s are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family from Scot@@ ney : &quot; the lor@@ ds seemed to be the fitting of it , always back debts and spending money for things which they could not aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men sol@@ ving their debt crisis by taking rich old women - I present it to me as a bun@@ ch well worth seeing boys , with a talent in order to advertise the land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of his revenue in the castle , Rho@@ des on the search of other unique write @-@ experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ se@@ än@@ m@@ ä@@ ki , the grounds of a plum@@ atory from the early 20th century , which has been returned from nature again since then .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to do completely with the dam@@ n life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ ans@@ elle is covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
the town of Bad Honnef last Friday their campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) on Friday the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ ans@@ elle at Rh@@ ön@@ dorf ( Rund@@ schau on Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team will keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August it will be a highlight of the campaign a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; to be beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the promotion since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf Chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write it on her yesterday website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and in order to make clear that something is better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm convic@@ tion that we as a bath Hon@@ orary Citi@@ zens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiv@@ eness of our city very well . &quot;
with the action there is more than &quot; a logo and a slogan , it continues to grow .
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a common promise that gives the city a distinctive sole discretion . &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities .
a mid @-@ digit amount is the City of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef the new umbrella brand and the campaign costs .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) served at retirement age and convey@@ ors in army cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting took place no more in the building of the general Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister &apos;s office .
he also participated in the consultations under the presi@@ dency of the Heads of Government and the Minister of Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
this was the number of civilians in the Y@@ as .
the government moves the re@@ ins to the military .
chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been depos@@ ed .
from the failed Cou@@ p has fired 169 of 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ ers since the failed Cou@@ p .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections for the movement of exile @-@ pre@@ dig@@ er Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len to see the Erd@@ og@@ an as wire drawing of the coup .
for 486 people , which have been directly involved in the coup attempt , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an was named &quot; Divine gift , &quot; since he would give him the opportunity to clean the forces &quot; completely . &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an the army really in the handle ?
in late February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading of &quot; dis@@ comfort in the military quarter . &quot;
in the general strike there is a concern with an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among others in the abol@@ ition of the head of the head@@ ings for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper .
the large gu@@ ards at the army and security forces continues to go on .
in mid @-@ July Erd@@ og@@ an sent a further 73@@ 95 state @-@ fired bul@@ lets , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
when it seemed that Erd@@ og@@ an seemed to mark the military .
gener@@ als were earlier than the actual lor@@ ds of the country .
three times p@@ atter@@ ed them on their role as the gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world military organisation .
after his election victory of 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pushed the power to the power of the military step , not last committed to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an is now developing a Islam@@ ization of the forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; he warned a well @-@ called officer , who sought after the coup attempt on asylum from pursu@@ it abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extrem@@ ist and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years .
if this means that NATO could not leave Nato .
in the Alliance there is doub@@ ts about the pur@@ ification of the Turkish Army in accordance with the pur@@ ification of the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; says Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
it will give a new US in@@ mig@@ rate plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
it stipul@@ ates that legal immig@@ rants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for the proceeds of visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is supposed to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , saving wages and billions of dollars for tax pay@@ ers , and will do this by expor@@ ting the United States as well as the citizens from other countries will be issued . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
these new application procedure will come to the candidate who speak English to support the financial funds to help themselves and knowledge of our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from American media .
Ministry wants to change course for race opportunities shuttle
it has been cont@@ ested over the past few months over the future of the racing division - now it should go fast .
even before the end of the year , the high @-@ distance route is to be built on which the tourist road is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the transport platform in the long term , construction of the Ministry of Transport should begin construction in this year .
&quot; with the decision to continue to order and to order the road from Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country prof@@ esses the country particularly for tourism , &quot; explained traffic state Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for the repair of the distance decreased to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum take over the country 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered from the country by the country , is currently defin@@ iti@@ vely coordinated , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the ministry and the southern shopping centre can be reached via the technical details .
&quot; so , the road@@ map , which are used for vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the race track would be to be ordered regularly by December 2017 .
the race @-@ platform shuttle is a popular train connection between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
during the past months the track has been tested for the course of a pilot operation , whether the distance of plenty of people is used to order them again in the future .
the route is also very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the Asc@@ ent of Sex robots is real , and we ought to worry about
just as you thought that 2017 may not be crazy yet , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robot is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start their ascent .
customers can choose the ey@@ eb@@ ox of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; the people are fun on them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key at the release of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone gel that feels warm , with the human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can also adapt to its robots , &quot; and it can select everything from the eye @-@ colour of the robot over the form of fli@@ p@@ ples to the type or the colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it will still rest still , as many robots love the &quot; personal@@ ities &quot; that would look like a Step@@ per @-@ Woman progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
the real B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt their users to adapt their robots to the properties that inv@@ ent them , such as rel@@ ap@@ ses .
and then there is still the true companion of Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre@@ programmed personal@@ ities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of ti@@ ci@@ pl@@ ess and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality who is adapted as good as possible , &quot; is the website of True Compan@@ ion .
that &apos;s what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
she also has her m@@ oods in the day - like real people !
it can be tired to be fixed on con@@ vers@@ ation , or it can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
there are many un@@ distur@@ bing aspects in this ascent of sex robots - not least because they could replace real human relationships , but the subject of human traits - but the subject to rape , if one goes a step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : resist@@ ible ) Far@@ rah , be@@ eing one in most .
on his site is True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .

however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or just another sex team .
their birth and its increasing refin@@ ement point to a little dar@@ ker and deeply under@@ lying in our culture , to a withdrawal of gender equality to an option of sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as optional adding .
most men are naturally not going to keep sex robots , while the FR@@ R indicated their rising popularity , they remain in the fr@@ inge of consumer culture .
but what &apos;s out of the Rand@@ om zones can be le@@ ak@@ ened in terms of the spirit of the time , in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not strange or irrit@@ ated , until they are given the free market for this .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these high @-@ developed sex robot in a time to occur in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is an president in the White House , who has g@@ rie@@ ve women sexual attacked .
the most horri@@ fic aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the ma@@ id@@ servant &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the in@@ corrup@@ tible body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump but at the moment it feels like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to real women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with a Por@@ no@@ star Pro@@ por@@ ter ) .
their gro@@ wers want to feel human being human being to im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , on the point , when it comes to its &quot; personal@@ ities , &quot; robots do not represent real women .
they can &apos;t be split by their companions or simply go away .
you don &apos;t have a medi@@ ation or background history , nothing , what in@@ depen@@ dency or anything that might need to inter@@ rupt the fantasy sub@@ jug@@ ation .
differently : they are counter@@ ing slaves .

Tr@@ um@@ ps large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human understanding
it has become a B@@ ins@@ en@@ we@@ ish@@ eit of the Tr@@ ump era that the political att@@ itudes , which have sensor @-@ voters , also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and harvest f@@ ooth@@ ed there were in the USA newspapers with suggestions about how to circum@@ vent comp@@ iling with the hor@@ ror by dump relations .
we all supp@@ os@@ edly supp@@ os@@ edly listen to our filter bub@@ bles .
in less not@@ ices the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families have been co@@ ached .
I mention this , because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ directional dip that lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it remin@@ ded me that unity of a common enemy may have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them knows , including Republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and very distinct on the same side .
in order to be the dining table , this is certainly a good deal , but it falls in a further context that this also brings significant risks to itself .
the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the de@@ forming effect of his Presidency has the power to push all the right to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ate possibility that his m@@ ittens of one day do not stum@@ ble .
however , there is still a terri@@ fying long @-@ time scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the Right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes &quot; which appear once a comparison to his standards as an inc@@ iner@@ ary of failure .
I found myself from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for co @-@ making a funny version of the decline , the dog on the car , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - which both occur in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild offen@@ ders .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the biggest of the Car@@ ou@@ sel of the New York &apos;s park department , and the top three dollars that one can spend in the city if there is no caffeine required .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass design on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are ador@@ able and the animals turn to look full of anxi@@ ety over her own shoul@@ ders - extremely dark and the climate per@@ ing music will give this a notable way .
so many cl@@ ing of a city dis@@ ap@@ pointing : the views of high buildings are becoming old , the Sky@@ lines will be familiar to offer much exc@@ itement , and the reality of the city will not just@@ ify the dream .
five and thirty years later , and I still didn &apos;t come across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the topics of the Ye @-@ Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience since here two years , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ ies can go on it and all have a great time .
when I had made the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given the full score , but fortunately no one has asked him .
on the other hand , I was forced to spend my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee table on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to purchase an average of 15 % tip - this to purchase something about the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exercise pressure on the server to enter personality in a situation that is not necessary .
the poor woman in the department store stood without exc@@ uses , while I tired the experience I made my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us was transferred to the hospital with chest pain from the prison .
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for the second time for a hospital visit .
last year , he was transferred to hospital for the treatment of Schn@@ itten to the hospital , which he suffered to the prison authorities after a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to death of a complaint in murder , because of an appeal to prosec@@ uting the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s early morning by taking her several times through a door to the toilet block in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria on them .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he was his love for a night int@@ ru@@ der who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to submit this time against the six year sentence by Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say that it is very dense .
the National Criminal Authority said that they will be imposed by the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ections can be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is running danger that his penalty will be increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a noticeable egg
the last of the Blum@@ berger schools were released from arch@@ ers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen for holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the German students will go to the secondary school , four at the secondary school .
school manager Angel@@ ika S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of the school branch the 29 students elected in the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle , who is growing in poultry , but then released into freedom .

instead of a chick@@ ens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope he cut off from him a chicken , cut off his wings on a high mountain , and broke down his wings .
after that , classes showed three and four during the study of Y@@ v@@ onne Frank a chicken .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder contributed to the bet .
the Adler stand for the integration , manager Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
however , the young was different from the other young ( ch@@ icks ) .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its determination is to be free .
they wish everyone &apos;s quadru@@ ple , that he feels at his new school .
many thanks to the colleagues , the former shoul@@ ders , Michael Müller , who has always came up again with lessons , and the parents represented .
the coast time is now over , he explained class Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their pupils after two years of lessons very un@@ just , because it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the quadru@@ ple .
finally , all students left a song from summer time and holiday @-@ time .
in the midst of their children the great joy broke out .

software update for diesel vehicles : what you need to know
how does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at an overview .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group are software updates for around 5.3 million cars .
they are to improve the exhaust @-@ behavior of cars of the Euro 5 emission classes and some Euro 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europa are estim@@ ations :
is the new action to be mandatory ?
no , the negoti@@ ated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles , the g@@ lows software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin .
the power station @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and from when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a fast implementation in the next few months , but not called exact date .
Daimler informed us to write every person .
if not due to an inspection , this will be done in their frame .
how long do the change come over ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; Say S@@ met@@ anin .
the view from the involvement of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , will@@ ingly offered the car manufacturers on the topic of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
Zeit@@ er cannot be to get an appointment .
what do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE are waiting for .
presumably there would be foreign producers , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is now there a massive amount of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions , where passengers do not thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there are no impair@@ ment losses for older diesel .

LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glorious events in Washington .
the first prize was awarded under President Tr@@ ump into a political way .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
LL Cool J ( 49 ) gets as the first ra@@ pper at the prestigious Kennedy Center .
like the cultural institution on Thursday , the singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograph@@ er in Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) became the schol@@ ars .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will stage a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania on the awarding .
the award winner of the Le@@ ar &apos;s progressive TV series announced the reason to attend the participation in the gala .
the New York Times , &quot; said : &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neg@@ lec@@ ting the arts and human rights - even the means to escape and bur@@ dened them . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphas@@ ized , they will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clear their vision .
the Kennedy @-@ Center after former president John F. Kennedy named Kennedy Center is the largest cultural direction in the US capital .
the former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom Han@@ ks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente next year .
the place is already written - suitable candidates are however ra@@ r .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been working since 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun , as it gives the press talk .
it reports a varied , but challenging tasks that wait for his followers .
at the same time , it &apos;s true that no application has to be fulfilled for the requirements .
the city is looking for the next possible time a architect or construction engineer .
thus , - under regard of the regular period of notice - still enough time for a development .
since Has@@ lach was responsible for the administrative authority as a sub@@ sid@@ y law , candidates must retain appropriate agreements .
for this function wants to keep the city on any case .
if it would not fill them any more , you would have to go up the citizen to the Offen@@ burg .
but the city near the city and itself is important , says W@@ acker who reports from a good operating lim@@ a as well as good mood between the authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years , some important projects have gathered in office , looking back on the W@@ acker pro@@ ud@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a varied projects in the future are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the low @-@ ho@@ e parking lot are on the side .
the Kin@@ ds between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the style of the stadium is still subject to the topic .
the latter alone will strike at about 1.5 million euros in be@@ ech , &quot; if we &apos;re doing it right , &quot; estimates W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all we wait for great tasks on my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is present for a Stadt@@ bau@@ master of large playing room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s , its own construction yard and hardness can be highly flexible to many .
&quot; it is possible to move a lot , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the founding plants will ever be lob@@ b@@ ying of citizens and visitors .
since the old town is as a historical monument , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have it , &quot; if new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the constru@@ ctive city master .
he carries high responsibility in the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
he is builder , &quot; at the end it runs all here over my table . &quot;
for care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been in existence for 15 years .
also that his successor remains , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wanted to be identified and want to remain . &quot;
for continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating lim@@ a , but also for the further design of the city .
those who want to inherit Roland W@@ acker should have a graduate studies as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with a degree of architecture in the areas of construction and building instruction .
civil engineering , civil engineering , civil engineering , civil engineering , municipal administration , urban municipal court with building yard and urban development , including monument protection , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : southern route lock
according to the police , the blue bike had thrown away the blue bicycle on the rail track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
thus , these were badly damaged , that the her@@ al@@ ous freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male singers and search for the night hours after them .
close to the facts were witnesses of a ros@@ ary wheelchair and bike driver had been observed .
&quot; that goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ ying kingdom , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to A@@ PA .
the or the perpet@@ rators now brought itself in major risk and also end@@ anger@@ ed traffic .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the facility , as well as the delayed flight and the costs for rail traffic , even more @-@ ray customers could come to the perpet@@ rators .
all in all , there was a &quot; significant &quot; to go out , the speaker told .
the damage were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south route could be guided without disabilities .
nearly ten staff were dropped on Friday morning , two of them concerned the correspondence .
freight lifts are not fallen , however , they had late .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 meters upper wire .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red me@@ ats , dairy products and chocolate could help lenses IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
however , a new study claims that the contrary : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could lin@@ ens the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases .
the imper@@ me@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States , causing stomach tra@@ ps and ble@@ ach , recur@@ ring or bloody attacks , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually caught , flesh and dairy products found to avoid their symptoms , researchers at the Washington university found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins were developing a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , that hide themselves in the eating .
cells that are able to dissolve inflamm@@ ations are poured out by cells , protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues .
if the balance becomes too far towards inflamm@@ ation , it can result in an infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance transport cell in mice was used to carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their inn@@ ards .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus Spor@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells that encourage tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an rich diet is toler@@ able , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ ot@@ us , if the same system is effective in humans .
the post@@ doctoral degree in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan worked out a kind of immune cell when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that had been separately accommodated but this did not .
they assumed that the difference to do the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ oms of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that usually live in the stomach intest@@ inal tract .
the dam@@ s of mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and were found in six bacterial species , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were drawn up in a ster@@ ile environment so that they were a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they were not developed these kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria over@@ looked at the immune system , the researchers sent L. reu@@ ter@@ i into a fluid , and caused small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as an In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid .
when the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people may protect the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us will protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i to our gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an an@@ nex products in people like in mice , but defects were found in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in people with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells are able to control inflamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the intest@@ inal .
potenti@@ als may lead high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to a expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
in Manchester United had signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes his debut on S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the final season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins , and impressive in the holder role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the Blues @-@ Asia tour of the blues and took only 45 minutes , what Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho had to improve from the beginning of the Premier League @-@ season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in nature , how he th@@ inks - he think football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va Stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho celebrated its start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent enth@@ ron@@ ed in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho could yet wish three more recent comm@@ it@@ ments , but it insi@@ sted that the club has already provided a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of its four pre @-@ continent .
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the club , &quot; he added .
&quot; I will be happy when they get four of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US @-@ aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner to the sky .
the pilot flew in Seattle in the U.S. state in Washington , the drawing started out in Marqu@@ ette in the U.S. state , and went to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , that is several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
in the sh@@ iel@@ ding , the shape of a Dream@@ liner was too .
the whole was a cardio test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 787 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new r@@ ash for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is yet revol@@ ving : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD chief , the Socialist Prime Minister informed the election with a certain concern in Berlin .
only no trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting from the party centre , merely a wind wind out of the covenant - such as the most important desire of the election dam@@ pers .
since Martin Schulz has changed the party , the fundam@@ ent@@ ally has changed .
since then , the employees of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House with growing hor@@ ror shall keep the events in the SPD @-@ reg@@ ated state capit@@ als .
what gave Schulz from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with counter@@ wind in the approach .
it was deep attacks .
and another one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the CDU CDU sees a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Green Party .
&quot; this once again shows : red @-@ Green is easy @-@ to @-@ proof , &quot; said the CDU @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising fra@@ ction of a Green Party , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) has over@@ thrown into a severe crisis .
five months before the Parliament election his red @-@ green Coalition lost their votes against the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German business@@ man Michael Kell@@ ner has sum@@ med down the Angl@@ o @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ de@@ pu@@ ties in El@@ ke T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets to rep@@ lic@@ ate their mandate .
the tak@@ eover of the CDU represents a clear delay of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ anu@@ ary must immediately give her mandate , &quot; said the German business@@ man and elec@@ toral struggle of the Green network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; this may not be true for all , &quot; the SPD election dam@@ pers , than in Friday morning , the new hip @-@ message was reached by the Party headquarters .
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands out after the tak@@ eover of the Green M@@ ke T@@ ets for the CDU without their own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of an entire series of large and small cris@@ es in SPD feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the mis@@ ery began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue @-@ eye , no more , soo@@ thing the com@@ ra@@ des once more .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
it was then clear - and it was significantly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the spark of Kiel , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite s@@ ands the party smooth .
the com@@ ra@@ des re@@ cl@@ ed in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had turned into a new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit arrived from Hamburg .
and with him the next set@@ back came .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD landing , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because he was in the crisis communication rather than anything wrong , what they can do wrong .
since then he has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
due to the VW @-@ emission and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister President has already been on criticism in criticism .
Mi@@ ese Swit@@ ching values were added .
even though , or perhaps , because in the past weeks , since then , in the past few weeks , Christ tried again to set acc@@ ents .
the amb@@ ition of former Mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , was not hidden in the field of Martin Schulz as well .
they let him give him since they spoke a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite may occur .
because of the parti@@ ality , because of the part@@ is@@ an internal can@@ opy , there is no gu@@ ilt in the Lower Saxony .
and Schulz are not at all .
therefore , the com@@ rade is therefore closed to keep the own rows .
her wrath is aimed at the gre@@ enery , and here especially on the rebel@@ li@@ ous par@@ li@@ ament@@ ous par@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cra@@ w@@ ns , such as Mrs. T@@ omas their own career , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of the part@@ n@@ ines in the SPD Bundestag @-@ Parliament , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr@@ s T@@ iro is not due to their person as a direct @-@ can@@ oe , but also elected to Parliament on the list of Lower Saxony , so the Sax@@ on de@@ pu@@ ties continued .

funding for Zone III
who would like to renov@@ ate his home in the years , can get back next to the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three Represent@@ atives of Ste@@ g Urban Development on Wednesday appeared in not@@ ches .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler had a look back at the events so far .
it has been in feelings since 1991 .
then , in the San@@ tic@@ gebiet I of 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was at least 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the former San@@ markings are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it was finally important to promote the interior development , and not only complete new construction areas .
on April 4 , I received information from the Governing Board of Karlsruhe on the information that there will be a San@@ itary zone III .
the total amount amounts to 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which would be 500 000 Euros from the country , the remainder of the municipality .
how does a rehabilitation area consist of ?
you will continue to continue Sch@@ in@@ dler , where they are &quot; really old &quot; houses .
it also plays a role if in the planned area of any interest in time , to be rehabil@@ it@@ ated .
if necessary , the local borders may then post@@ p@@ one another .
the jet@@ ty entered Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel , on Wednesday evening .
cell@@ ars presented the content of the federal states &quot; Social town , &quot; which would then be carried out as part of the rehabilitation .
core of the program are the development of buildings , supporting the living and working conditions and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out , that is , per plot .
then the rehabilitation area would then be established as a statute .
the licence period for funding is running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , the existing survey would be conducted , as part of them involved in the remedi@@ ation area to fill out a questionnaire .
the decision should be made possible in November or December , so that in coming year with the san@@ iti@@ ations it will be possible .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then declared that every municipality had to conduct the predicted pre @-@ investigations .
it is therefore to evaluate the urban abuse , and decide when san@@ ction is re@@ ated and in which size .
there will be a re@@ organisation in the land register for the particular plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come once again after feelings and make a picture of the location , she promised them .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , a substantial success factor for the project is the participation of the parties involved .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens over the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the Yellow Quest@@ ionn@@ aire is the &quot; Building and bound@@ ary &quot; in which it goes among others for the building status and the renovation .
in grey Quest@@ ionn@@ aire , the &quot; App@@ li@@ - and housing &quot; , the information about size , spl@@ itting and population of a living room are made .
the blue &quot; business bow &quot; can only be filled if the business premises are operated .
however , in mind , Got@@ zel , pointed out that a filling questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of funding is working after the &quot; Wind@@ screen principle &quot; - who first comes first , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
you can do not reserve any funding for later . &quot;
finally , photos of the project &quot; Zone II &quot; were shown to make a restoration &quot; pal@@ ate . &quot;
British inventor himself sets a micro@@ chip to come with a hand@@ held movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro chip to open his office and even start with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index fingers and offers the service for businesses and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he worked together with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an ad@@ visory holding in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standard .
the technology is similar to a cats and dogs . it takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change castles at houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional cost of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the cost of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a n@@ avy @-@ helicopter to fly to South La@@ wn to fly for an event held by the American manufacturing , cost tax@@ pay@@ ers to the data of the military , which were transferred to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when President on board , was the heart of the event on 17th July in the White House with American building programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , vice president Mike P@@ ence and executive officer of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 States .
the helicopter , which was produced in Connecticut , was issued by a yacht out of Ma@@ ine , a fire fighter from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn , after notes of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn and so long remained until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in the evening .
note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be needed for return flight .
the original airline sat down during helicop@@ ters during the time during security personnel during the time on the plane .
from the TI@@ ME used by the TI@@ ME , it wasn &apos;t clear whether a second flight crew was necessary .
the Hatch Act has set up federal government to use state @-@ owned property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 indicates whether the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are shut up , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was named as an official event by the White House and has not been covered by Brands Hatch .
but also official events have political harmon@@ ics .
at the event , the President gave a violation of the reform of health reform that was in the Senate in the middle of the course , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to safegu@@ ard the govern@@ ance of government regulation .
the use of the plane that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , derived from political reasons , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but to request your use only for a photo OP , is un@@ common .
Tr@@ ump introduced an investigation into February , when the presidential airplane stood before the background of his first campaigns in Melbourne , Florida , Ta@@ xi@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 States , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Commander of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 Occup@@ ations are often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn to depos@@ e the US President in the White House with precise cuts .
at the beginning of July , when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led to the White House 58 exercise sessions .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted among the training needs of the Air Force for the month , said the official .
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flo@@ or@@ ted in addition to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers have no burden for one of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man by S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said , the company was not involved in it to depic@@ t the helicopter to the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not maintains bud@@ get@@ ed drawings for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ zation of the US Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D Award for V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
recording of the unit recorded flight time of an airplane than 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for operation of the helicopter can be far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers in the basis of estimates for attendance rates is highly ir@@ re@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; this estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the award kits for Do@@ D does not contain the personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion .
at that time , the former White House , S@@ ean Sp@@ ade , def@@ ended the use of helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ade .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national safety , and I go out that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have spent un@@ ti@@ ring .
it is , of course , it is in@@ adequate . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump with the helicopter is inter@@ acting , when he entered his tour through the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump said to representative of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ sleben with the media on his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

despite five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ us balance sheet , the leader of the Second Tennis division has received the sense of reality .
team manager Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has at least respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
just in the rear position I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV provide mainly the imports coming from the high North .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to the inserts in the Davis Cup .

&quot; it will always be hard for us . &quot;
there you will need a good bit of luck . &quot;
the ninth crew for the trip to the high North is practically .

roll back@@ ward : the city presents 46 kitchen tables
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lun@@ ches again itself .
with fixed part@@ akers for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back into the urban nurs@@ ery workshops .
as of September 1 , the City of Kre@@ feld will take care of food supply in the urban children &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head in the Department of Youth A@@ id , is this good news : &quot; we &apos;ve enjoyed all of us . &quot;
cooked by house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh bo@@ iled ch@@ illed .
the city operates in the Kre@@ ms Area 46 kinder@@ garten , in 44 the children get a warm meal at noon .
in the last Kit@@ eline , 2800 children each sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are taken care of 45 week@@ hours in the K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour supervision for children until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 divi@@ ding forces from the 1st of September : they heat up the sl@@ ate meals , supplement them to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give food out , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a c@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two group@@ ed facilities such as seven @-@ eng@@ aging facilities - decides about the hours of departure .
&quot; the kitchen staff are now firmly connected to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; they are much stronger than they have been stronger and implemented for the course of the project management , as well as their ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because it is also : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children are to help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force is supposed to be sen@@ sible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of kitchen forces - will be done in the future by special cleaning staff .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm of the kitchen performance also the charm , which they have turned out in the cost @-@ year between own rule and foreign currency for the city as the most economic , it is from the press office .
and that , though 46 job forces are set new .
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at some 750 people in the gu@@ ardian sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .

has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the page of La Liga likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not disp@@ uted in her persecution by Ne@@ ym@@ ar after having left an offer of £ 189 million to trigger its release cl@@ ause , but have warned Barcelona 3 years ago before the world record ?
the spectacular approach has crossed the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season .
following the completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar is the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athletes in the world . PS@@ G has more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way , as Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way outside the Catal@@ ans , although a source in the proximity of the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but the soccer world was warned three years ago by the PS@@ G presi@@ dency ?

Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish society is at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by having lost one of their homes for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ ire report dis@@ bur@@ dened by Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Domain report on the abuse of abuse acts Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this author writer and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ usable area at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Domain Trust continues to discussions .
Christian Proph@@ ecy , spokes@@ man of the reform@@ ist movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today , Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , and from the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who issued the 93 @-@ year old brother of the journalist Benedict XVI , re@@ ap@@ ologies .
it would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest regre@@ t over their own sub@@ missions or their then wrong estim@@ ation of operations .
the Vatican law &quot; Os@@ servat@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ized that in the coverage of violence among the &quot; two lei &quot; measure . &quot;
with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one knows that it would need to be &quot; sh@@ ackl@@ ly and damaged acts &quot; do the power and escape in the future ; however , the &quot; degree media man@@ ipulation , &quot; such as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ ori@@ ans and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; the ic@@ onic church , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and preparing the public mind to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
also Prin@@ ces Gloria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; they will be happy to go on the church and this is a matter of hands . &quot;
Moreover , they pointed out that in their adolesc@@ ence , &quot; conclusions were a whole normal @-@ ped@@ agog@@ ical agent , &quot; in order to be able to get ready . &quot;
they are fair , to present the standards for earlier decades , because the world have changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse cases , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
entirely wrong , author and historian Michael E@@ emann , who sum@@ med up the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) , too .
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all that had nothing to do with him , he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is written in the 440 page report , which was submitted by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Domain were victims between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ sts &quot; victims of survi@@ vor@@ s , 67 domains of sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it was said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , which was held in Regensburg between 1964 and 1994 : &quot; in summary , this means that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms physically and psych@@ ic violence .
the punishment for the student has just been able to fail .
in contrast to numerous other cases , in contrast to numerous other states , many victims were ass@@ ump@@ ed the common humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories . &quot;
in an interview , E@@ emann , why the final report on the failure sc@@ and@@ al in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Domain , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , explains his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of non@@ violence at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture by Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for a lifting of many students &quot; Human@@ ity . &quot;
for the other , it also appears as a Chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which has been handy for the oil , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has no top performance .
how do you evaluate it as his bi@@ ograph@@ er this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front until the rear , it is necessary to ask for that the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
he is dedicated to him even eight pages and is clearly acquitted of each sus@@ pic@@ ion of the communications or co @-@ knowledge in the horri@@ ble cases of sexual abuse .
the non@@ violence at the Pre @-@ school took place outside of its effici@@ encies .
one can refuse to it , of which too late or didn &apos;t have first noticed enough .
the Dom@@ aine gram@@ mar school , on which he worked , was conducted by virtually all respon@@ dents than - so literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
this also presents the wide majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , a very excellent record , described him as &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; &quot; upright , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; under@@ stand@@ able teachers , who supplies the guys regularly with cake , cookies and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always um@@ ber@@ ated from children of children . &quot;
only a minority is characterized by its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high e@@ alog@@ onal@@ ity , that led to the out@@ breaks even times .
that he did not only cast with chairs and threw the keys on the ground , but also did ear@@ ing boys to the hair or ears , he has already been prepared for years ago , deeply sad@@ dened and exc@@ used for it .
however , in honor of his honor , such gu@@ ardian were to be widely used in frag@@ ile time , 1960s and 1970s , in parents such as with teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us , born 1968 .
I also have seen that still in a school , a state gymn@@ asium .
compared with the word that actually happens in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and violence at the pre@@ school , the fre@@ il@@ i Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
since one asks , if it does not have to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI , that many media has just crossed on him .
on the Bavarian pop@@ e , there are many who never understood it , still je@@ al@@ ous .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media the report was reported much about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Domain .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also any processing or wi@@ z@@ ard with regard to sexual abuse on load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clear no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have committed the domain name .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never made me to talk with my father or my mother , &quot; said a person concerned for the others , &quot; It was really all very embar@@ r@@ assing . &quot;
the real problem in the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and yet , that most victims from Sch@@ am silent .
if they haven &apos;t entrusted to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then , not a ch@@ oral director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do you rate the unemployment rate of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a frag@@ ment@@ ing student has formulated this way : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had expected to have thought that he could have been able to win their respective perpet@@ rators .
I have to stop it ... also for the ab@@ sur@@ d , to accept that ... Bu@@ ben en@@ ur@@ gent or clear@@ er or rather , as opposed to their parents , Inter@@ nat@@ s@@ leit@@ ers , Confi@@ denti@@ als etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
thus the report comes to the clear result : &quot; that the student must be affected by students and / or their surroundings , could not be confirmed in the context of the study . &quot;
regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free of contact with each parti@@ ality .
so he can &apos;t be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad .
therefore , no reason to bring his good name with these contra@@ di@@ ct crimes in connection , as it happened in some cases .
in the media a lot of &quot; Viol@@ ence &quot; were reading at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Domain .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown into the &quot; Weg@@ ner &quot; report .
do he have to live with this off@@ ence ?
Michael E@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the coverage all mixed and men@@ tioning a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the midst of , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly what again a mis@@ use of the report .
because it will be clean : between the school and school of the Dom@@ spar@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say once again , other alleg@@ ations .
the report covers Inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , i.e. from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the cathedral .
the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where the l@@ ad of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers have been sh@@ ame@@ ful and dre@@ ad@@ ful , all of them met at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ zh@@ ausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous conditions have to have ruled .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he had only got her face when she had already been at the Dom@@ aine gram@@ mar school .
on that was , like most witnesses , the subject &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
it was only happy to be escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ en@@ ic &quot; states .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ aine gram@@ mar school ?
Michael E@@ emann : as a discipline happens , but there was no sa@@ dist@@ al force .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , at which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were estim@@ ating the common humanity by R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories . &quot;
so at the most still the alleg@@ ations still remains .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which the states had been reported on the school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish and from their predecess@@ ors at a school where he had not been active and responsible , ( such the witness ) nothing wanted to hear , and then again around 1993 .
inside Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is consistently the ears att@@ aching ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ ine ymn@@ asium , which the report was even re@@ produced .
this indicates that he insi@@ sts that in the pre @-@ school it will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
already in view of the risk of negative new press release , he remained ur@@ gent .
that was , of course , it was , of course , as legal clarity , as a test cat@@ ching also in Bavaria .
before that occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us still knows .
there was also a hard value for him , where the suffer@@ ers may have passed ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatic , and where the allowed limit was exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say , he would have gone out .
that is not so easy .
the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980 .
Fürst@@ in Gloria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is said it is un@@ fair to apply to today &apos;s educational standards at the time of time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ out of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger that insi@@ sts to evaluate today &apos;s moral standards .
since the prin@@ cess has been right .
but this is not true for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ h@@ am@@ ous to all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school for re@@ charges and violence to innocent children &apos;s seas , which is far beyond that far beyond that .
it &apos;s all terrible and I &apos;m glad , that it is finally opened .
but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all that had nothing to do with him .
his means to discipline and pun@@ ishments , so ear@@ mu@@ zzle and at the hair and ears , they were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he has also kept strictly adher@@ ed to it .
what image of his time is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , as in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ?
was the topic : rebu@@ ke also to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , because the domains played only one side role .
nevertheless , I did not forget that he led a reg@@ iment to it .
but even this must also be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without having un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly possible to form well as national cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went directly to the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) on tour .
with bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no great singers and standing before each success , like this area , but still discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
than what kind of people do you have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks in their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : I really lear@@ nt with the work of the book and in addition I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep believers and warm good people from which you could not imagine that he could do something .
I get regularly with how many former domain ones still get to him today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and how a member of their family has been treated .
those who didn &apos;t forgive him until today , that he was once strictly to them , are therefore clearly in minority .
most of the domain markets are than@@ k@@ ful to him today that he enrich@@ ed their lives and brought them into the world of music .
and that he always was a good , v@@ a@@ ful teacher - a strict father , certain that may be like - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ect@@ sper@@ son , to whom they still watch and honor them .
and , please , once again clearly : everything that &apos;s preferred before him are educational methods that were then on the agenda .
we can be happy that we have overcome this time long .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sin @-@ bo@@ ck .
there is the evil intention , that is behind him , just too obviously .
for the report that was just released , reli@@ eves him .
now the subject area would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired large mer@@ its and without the outside Bay@@ erns and perhaps Germany would probably know no one to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Domain , finally in peace .
