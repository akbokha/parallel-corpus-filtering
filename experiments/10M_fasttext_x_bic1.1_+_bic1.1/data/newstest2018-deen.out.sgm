<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An upstream ascension, where youths should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A vault chapel where the tunnel is dug out for the S-Bahn tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners achieve the unique reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nerved if maps are not currently available.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows anyone who had to purify himself, because the car-Navi was instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of geoportas Bayern of the state government, are all other than currently - but just very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, how cities and municipalities in the area of Munich have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a carpet estry that is not equal to such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">For towns and municipalities more detailed maps, so-called uronic datasheet, were incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">This was created according to the Bavarian surveying Administration between 1810 and 1864 and the first measurement of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the spring of 1800, French Heereship occupied Bavaria since the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">On behalf of Napoleon invoked an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when the French troops come along with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801: they were the present Neighbours who created the idea of a widespread Bayern-map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project ahead, founded the Topographic Bureau "and thereby strengthening the Bavarian surveying Administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The sanctuary for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is like all other on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is subduling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was meant 21 years after the establishment of the map, i.e. 1877, when the Munich district entry was meant.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today subduling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses are located around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the bureau of the Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the West park is, you can see nothing in fields - at first glance: if you zooming a small partial card with dozens lines and numbers: handwritten entries from the so-called "urge," from which the property is derived from.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no more farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterized by the north of subduling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, built in 1810 in the place of the Oktoberfest, had actually been a meadow - and no concrete desires in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map shows an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the territory of the district au-Haidhausen in the territory of this district Au-Haidhausen called not only the street name "at the patio," or from the headroom "On the fan," but also in large letters "the ascension."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auditor Street, one was once locked up people with extraordinary items.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the year 1858 / 59 was the Munich-Irish District Court "On the Auer Fan."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who is associated with King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time, and finished for example the anchor of the so-called eg.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has taught the staff to apply violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who occupied himself for an exhibition with the Ward.</seg>
<seg id="37">Initial unit for 280 patients was initially expanded, and was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the gyroast facility in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists in Germany since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people are coming to the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and went into a youth house with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the soccer field of the TSV Munich East, East of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house, "Casa Don Bosco" - reestablished in architectural rejection to the original building of the Irish army, which was destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was registered in 1856 as "principal place," the shopping street called "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change was the Second World War also at the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The allies of the Allies discovered many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great day remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a vault chapel from the Middle Ages were once at Marienhof, where these days will work and take place on 5 April 2017 at the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich-map can be compared with the aerial photo of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights published travel announcement for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for fostering Fares has issued a warning for colored people who travel due to the discriminating policies and racial attacks of the state after Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state of Missouri, which will come into force until August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and missourians, as a series of fragmenting, road-based incidents in the whole state and listed here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent Act of Missouri that makes it heavier and discrimination against discrimination as well as the prosecutenforcement agencies of the state that aim undisproportionate to minority groups, said NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries to citizens, through human rights.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are considered due to their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has been issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group of incidents were raced against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man of Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under fragmented circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more petrol during the journey through the government, and by the police of Missouri was charged without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the General Office of Missouri, which is shown that black car drivers will be more likely to be considered as white in the state.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"people need to be ready to bring the money, or to know the relatives that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015, Missouri was recorded in 2015, after the latest numbers from an anti-crime report of the FBI, which ranks the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th ranks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel policy is also an answer to a new Missouri Act that would make it difficult to complain a company for business or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberian Union (ACLU) issued travel records for Texas and Arizona, after which States had approved the authorities to commit local prosecution authorities to undertake people because of immigration fraud, which will contribute to the further penance of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel records are usually issued from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of other countries but in the last time advocacy groups the action is deployed to certain laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidezaunus project is Elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman's electric fence project is a success project and will continue in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU federal campaigns Peter White and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the administration of the Schwendemann family met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann also granted insights into its operation, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals, and houses in five apartments of Budapest.</seg>
<seg id="72">For him, the Black Forest Cmilk "is the way of the Alternative market to milk, the milk of its cows, so swiveling.</seg>
<seg id="73">The regional corner of the Feria festival is exclusively local.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also important to BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, it is important to the "Elemental Project as" Elementar. "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not generate profitable areas on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space for much work, much must be treated with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and the topography," emphasized Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the terrestrial operation and carried out this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it lead no bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the community has recognized the importance of the electric fence and is happy about leader funding."</seg>
<seg id="80">At costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the view of the faces could still be moved for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and mind thoughts, as they bring forth their operation," emphasised the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism of criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">Throughout 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The accounting area is thus 40 hectares which can not be stopped for at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half of funding was funded, a quarter contributed to the village of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently, the farmers remained invested €12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of wheat fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac emphasized: "you do not make a good job, no farmer and landing is not going to go."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White Rose: "best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The State Councillor (LPR) Baden-Württemberg and the State Promotion of Weidefence.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the accounting of the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">A prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR in patrons.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the insofar area cannot be traffed (hangings of over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the ascension.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fishal Weidezaunus project 2018 now the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would build nearly 16 kilometers of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The accounting area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated cost amounts to more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes off the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans are as well as every other - therefore the unclaimed overthrow of Saddam Hussone at the Firdos in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did, when he had a symbolic dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposal of the President for drastic limits of legitimate objection to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of Boatters and Liberty Imitators would have looked after him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their significance, and especially the significance that was attributed to her, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller was called Acosta: "I don't want to go to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an icon of American freedom that lightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to that later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is proper correctly, but as it formulated it itself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on the rütting words of Lazarus, the only one, in which a state does not load any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your labour, your poor, are free to breathe yourself; the poor out of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time to see in which the "lingering waste" was better visible on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">In Miller, Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly showed that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict in the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who confused to place their words after her death on the base - were very good that they completed a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republics by creating the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem is the female figure no more abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she has another name: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to retire from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is one of the early Neoconia that the American flame goes into the world: "Lady Liberty is proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="119">You should wear the torch of the freedom of the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusually, lembaugh is skated here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is whole and even a matter of vision of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The huge imaginative act of Lazarus was it that they see how they had seen from the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travel on the decks of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome that they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that's not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever want to know.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not lighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power is inflamed.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black commends Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two carrots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will be afford to the team "a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "Scotland has developed something special" in Scotland "and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to find out until we'll find out," Black said.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I talk with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has done something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athlete: it has something to do what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals of candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butler, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle was elected in the team at the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their mission statement was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or where they still live or practice, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the genuine feeling that express the Eilidh entirely of course were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-Silver medal winner, which will compete with its fifth World Championships for the 400 m Hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 shotters were in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">The largest number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance Muir leads along this path and has launched five British and two European recruitment in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part at 1,500 m and 5.000 m of runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another swiser, which one should keep the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first World Championships as the only other Scot in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The economic capitals says that they are "enormously proud" to the fact that many of her country skiers will not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and at the final.</seg>
<seg id="151">"to be the special about team capitals, it is that they had been chosen by the other members of the team, but to know that my team-mates have voted for me and voted to make it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi, who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It just shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on pods.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech as captains in capital?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to use this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympic stadium.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it's just like a great atmosphere. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Abandon Facebook: do not block on Facebook: do not cause a public office if you do not tolerate them from voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him for all, from the inner policy to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shimed with the critique, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For the year 1783 Washington said: "the freedom of freedom can be taken away - and, stupid, and dumb, we shall be led as sheep for the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to be working like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked contributions from at least 450 people and deleted their views on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberian Union defendants this week as early as the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the Governors dismissed the lawsuit as a frivol, and the online comment was full of a response with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a guy such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors members of the Nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a actionary pinion.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons, which come to the side of the governor - which is an official forum, which is officially declared officially and of employees who are paid by public tax-dollar - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defending Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's easy to use the image of trove or caving or hash filled people that force the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post talked with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no Trolle.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments are respectful, conceivable and not profited.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and he appealed the Catholic faith in Hogans.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not wet, but he asked them to hate hate.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented on me that I was disappointed, that there was no reaction to hate Hassle and other current news," he wrote in the comment field of the message with "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not consider this idea if a number of people in the same topic, then, they are misused by some more than a so-called collective, and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the staff of the governor as "concentrated spam-attack," would call "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a critic or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It's a lot more clean than in previous time when people had done that employee were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical fearches and to be burned and to be burned to the silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this just happens to happen.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials, who criticized him that he has been implicated Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users, blocked by Twitter Feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The president of the Supervisors of the Loudoun County, the first Aimment, according to the U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris, Alexandria, described a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect like the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers, varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous, tailored to his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had been Trolle.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" wrote, wrote all letters to newspapers, making Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticised its position on the contract of Amity, trade and shipping, with the United Kingdom, simply overwhelmed their position, according to historical documents written by the online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of freedom, disagreement and discourses are the foundation of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="349">Some of the top OPM guides come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">As a reaction, thousands of people were arrested in Paniai in the past few years, under the pretext of "securing the national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="351">Some dive again never again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice, which is sold in Enarotali, is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is exactly the range.</seg>
<seg id="356">The people here are building everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.</seg>
<seg id="358">They reserve most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota tasted only 10,000 Indonesian Indonesian pees (75 cents).</seg>

<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudas and Basille Longchamp became deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to films.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to phelim Kine, the deputy military director of Human Rights Watch, the promises made by Joktan, were unable to raise restrictions on coverage to improve transparency and development.</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new hazards for foreign journalists trying to report by Indonesiens unpeaceful provinces of Papua and Westpapua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government will largely be restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">In March called six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshalline and the Salomons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread injuries" in Papua including the paniai shooting.</seg>

<seg id="372">The spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir reported the allegations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia still a democratic system and there is free media, so it is difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights attacks."</seg>
<seg id="373">People want to know that more foreign governments should know this.</seg>
<seg id="374">When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the human right-ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited him on May 4, we propose freedom, according to a source that participated in the session but anonymously to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="375">Indonesia issued a further presidential election, but the Papua will say that they probably will not vote for Joktan.</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but it is surrounded by people that are involved in the paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="377">He wants that Jokovi know that the Paniai people think that it lives under the constant threats of a robberic military, in poor educational and health services.</seg>
<seg id="378">Gobai tells us that the Paniai people like other Papua, had their voice for Jokovi as a "guilt," which he must pay back.</seg>
<seg id="379">"they do not need money, they just want righteousness," he says.</seg>
<seg id="380">Despite the drenings and enrolments, families of the Paniai-Schussers led a last symbolic act of the Trotskyâ: the glue of an sacrifice was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station.</seg>
<seg id="381">They may not know that there will never be justice to them, but at least they don't forget her crime.</seg>

<seg id="402">You will continue to work to improve the application.</seg>
<seg id="403">Not until the vote, however, the suggestion had come to carry out the final in a neutral place.</seg>
<seg id="404">New from 2018, only comparatively smaller details: finalists will have the host rights in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will start the host in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="405">In order to reduce the cost of the organisers, the requirements regarding training places etc. are facilitated and the players will be able to complete the Davis Cup less official media-dates.</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 percent claimed that they would have been delayed that they were irresistible with firearm, ammo or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey carried out in more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet-charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., it also demonstrated that younger travellers abrupt the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of those questioned that they have been deliberately tried to fly with something that was banned by TSA, 19.7 percent millennials compared with less than 15 percent, the members of Generation X were.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items listed on TSA agents have been deliberately settled, were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent charged wiped items with blades caused by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male polls have also confirmed that they had been deliberately forbidden drugs into the aircraft.</seg>

<seg id="414">It's no surprise that people who are most likely to do so or wiper - through security, those who were most frequently used.</seg>
<seg id="415">The company however indicates that TSA guidelines are slightly complicated and confused.</seg>
<seg id="416">People are often insecure, which allow liquids to take them or how much of it.</seg>
<seg id="417">So it's no surprise that the largest amount of the objects used by the TSA was used for liquids.</seg>

<seg id="423">In addition to the triumphal numbers of sales enhancements and more of more-more targets, Tesla-chief Elon Musk declared for the first time a second, less smooth number: the cancellations made by the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">Musk had frequently asked more than 500,000 preorders for the new car in the past months, whose delivery is just starting.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk is a: of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 had already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics always had been pointed out that it only negotiated for non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla paid the 1000 euro in the US (1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 Pounds).</seg>
<seg id="428">At present, 455.000 of such committedly reservations confirmed, Musk was in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla Group has not been able to issue approximately twelve percent of all orders on the problem, but the Tesla boss does not believe.</seg>
<seg id="430">Its argument: the challenge at the ambitious growth target is not on demand, but on the production site.</seg>
<seg id="431">Tesla has supplied around 84,000 vehicles last year.</seg>
<seg id="432">All models are expected to be joined by 2018 - 500,000 one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are only 1,800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who can now order a "Model 3" at the earliest after the second half of 2018 - if Tesla has created it to drive its nagelnew, nor in practice tested production lines with maximum load capacity.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubting that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But if it comes to greater delays, then the non-binding may be a problem to the Tesla problem.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: mark the anniversary of the mining church will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16th, at 16.30 hrs to a Serenade.</seg>

<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique creamy."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilarius chapel was first mentioned for the first time in the Württembürgischer documents: count Hermann of Sulz sold the mountain with the following parish church at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document of the document, at the Tumlinger mountain apart from the impressive parish church, there is also a splendid courtyard, to which the church or cartridge was right and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So people lived there.</seg>
<seg id="474">Just as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt in 1858, beside the lower village and the Oberdorf, which today is still recognizable in the area of Tumlingen. now, the "mountain" is the third, the dominical settlers of the village.</seg>

<seg id="478">This was the right to use a priest or bishop a new priest.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two crushes on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell was then used for the first time in 1692, but later had to be released during World War II in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years War (1616 to 1648) the windows were carved and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undense.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke the pulpit and church mill out and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to enter 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the year 1834 a storm was dismantled the steeple tower and the half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To avoid an evil, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the still existing tower-werg remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>

<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all fourth households.</seg>
<seg id="523">NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer Viersens city council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind farm Linnich near Aachen and a shareholding at a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinberg district.</seg>

<seg id="583">"it is really strange that no one person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our parishes, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the organization of posting.</seg>
<seg id="584">"it is a dirt on a story, but it is a burden for our souls."</seg>
<seg id="585">Brooks is a 71-year-old former congress of State Georgia and a life of civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="586">For him it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that it has never been corrected.</seg>

<seg id="588">"we can not get to Healing and Reconciliation, until we get justice."</seg>

<seg id="590">According to FBI files created by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding lands were suspected in the LynchProcess.</seg>

<seg id="592">Although the suspects remain on the free foot for decades, Citizenship, the double motivation for the Lynch's actions in all the city was always known: politics and Sex.</seg>

<seg id="599">"as it emerged, Harrison, who prepared the Morde, has already made a FBI report.</seg>
<seg id="600">"it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the morse, proclaims and the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="601">Brooks formulated it more intense.</seg>

<seg id="604">For almost a decade, Cassandra's Greene has led the annual relaunch of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.</seg>
<seg id="605">Their representation is descriptive, moving and is justified in a kind of deepest racism, that many believed that he doesn't exist in America.</seg>
<seg id="606">It's hard to look, and still more difficult, but Greene said that the point is.</seg>
<seg id="607">"we don't want to talk about the Lynch, because we are confronted with what is confronts in us," said they.</seg>
<seg id="608">"but I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to or hear what I have done."</seg>

<seg id="617">Rascona erwiden the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then everybody breaks out (at least all black actors) in a derision.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene laughs at the worst.</seg>
<seg id="621">"what?!," he asked them.</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>
<seg id="623">Was I too hard?</seg>
<seg id="624">"no," Greene said, still kichever.</seg>
<seg id="625">"I just don't think the white people back then 'n' --- 'said'.</seg>
<seg id="626">But, though, one of the other black actors.</seg>
<seg id="627">"you need to hit the hard 'R.'."</seg>
<seg id="628">And just there is the energy in space, a feeling of camera body replaces the discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="629">Everyone is engaged to get this right, not only because of the game, but also because of memory to the four killed people.</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene starts again.</seg>
<seg id="631">This time, when Rascona the N Word says, he says it sharp and with a reprint.</seg>

<seg id="641">Up to this point the Morde has remained an Anecdote, but now if one stands on the same land where the Lynch-Morde took place, the air feels felt.</seg>
<seg id="642">When the last marks of the song, Greene invites the amount to come closer and to inspire the dead bodies.</seg>
<seg id="643">Children dance to their heads, register the fake blood and the silent body and whispered each other.</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," murmur a little boy, when he wanted to remind of it.</seg>

<seg id="865">And a gate after a freek you don't want to get caught any more.</seg>

<seg id="876">"now they can begin the season almost with a home play," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that players from Aue could perhaps be something fresh, since they could have no serious and complete play like Fortuna against a ascension into the bones.</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently standing," says the inner defending of Fortuna.</seg>
<seg id="878">The guests arriving from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday to the Encounter at last (almost) of the stadium of Aue.</seg>

<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain for the UEFA Europa, because the leading organization, which oversees European game, has power to offer teams from the access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, which were called from the UEFA Europa in 2011, mean that PSG has to take sometime, that the transfer of Neymar was financed without large losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to sell off the Brazil out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moved to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make money loose with safety so that Neymar sign and bring him into a galaxy of other Stars, in view of the financing of the team through the energy rich ruler of Qatar.</seg>

<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs had taken on enormous debts after success, effectively cheating and risk to ruinct, when banks or owners were back up their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP repealed from the concentration to the debt of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model used the Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested in order to build the crew and to build a global mark - to a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP plant, which runs until 2018, clubs can go losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini fell by the presidency in Ungnade in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to make a far off-reaching spending.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Nymar buy-out clause in a package case, it can distribute the amount of invoice over the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, allowing the payment to be terminated for the next five years at the amount of 44.4 million Euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>

<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs, trying to overprint their financial views by companies that are connected to the owners of clubs with owners of clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catastrophic company can sponsor PSG if the value of the Sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA dies would not apply to legitimes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">It was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the country's value was propelled by the PPE Tourism Authority in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar on payments of the World Cup Committee could come to Qatar in 2022.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar has disputed that Neymar WM ambassadors will be simply to recover and find such a derive maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The current sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will still be attentive to note each attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory conversations with PSG via Neyms transfer, on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They said under the condition of the anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1151">The association will assume that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing the signature.</seg>

<seg id="1165">About 17 million small red-white chocolate boards are distributed to 14 grams a year before landing on the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Over the cost the Swiss Life wanted to do no information.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry experts estimate the order volume in accordance with "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieved an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But importantly, allemal is the advertising effect: a prestige manufacturer is a prestige manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">How many applicants will be on the new press, the Swiss Life does not want to betray.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But in question, only Swiss manufacturers come.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report Chocolat Frey wants to make a renewal of the contract beyond the spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the SDA, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not able to reach a position.</seg>

<seg id="1182">Likewise, the first attempt qualified by the Polish frontdefenders of Piotr Malachowski, who designed 65,13 metres far for the final fight.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Nostalgia is in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repeat of history is also nostalgic because of the glorious days of the 80's, for the 90-years-horror era (as the predenker David Wain and Michael Showold the Sketch comedy, "The State" for MTV rotten), and for himself - that is, for 2001 before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefacts it is a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But when franchise feels it, the time would be short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"First Day of Camp" surprisingly surprisingly well, not only because of its absursurge Humors (it contained a original story for a speaking tin of vegetables which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By moving to the core of the galleys - actor's medium-age children play-up children who are growing - they created the impossibility to win the final part of the Witzes back.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults who are now adults, is less emotional and his parody is more emotional, including a reef to the Stalker films of the 90 "s, like" The Hand That Rocks the Cradle "(" The Hand showing the cradle ").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At a point a character through an Apple-Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from the year 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showage), now Romanautor, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau) still not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost its virility always.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is still a further mad-malicious plot to be included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showage), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the excourses are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see young young Mr. Rudd who will see Matt Dillons underlippings of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy joined himself as an old Knacker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">These are the moments of accidental madness, who could heat this franchise like a kind of repeated conclusion: "WET Hot American Summer: twenty Years Later," the last scene will show the band as she is going to visit the premiere "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: on the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "Glow" with his East-against-West Ring Iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka created comedy with Rhys Thomas as a director, there is a Romanian drama of the eighties, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, auism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main transport - a hard-churcher, and an idealistic Iosef - played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, with the dialogues of Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is synchronized to English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice galleon to see (the police takes the time to check out chess in TV, like Americans may do it with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides the voice out for an independent game 'finde'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is involved so much for the truth of an undoubtedly propaganda-drama - a murderer, which carries a Reagan mask - is that it often plays as a single stagan mask.</seg>
<seg id="1206">For six long episodes it moves away, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective" that was posted to a lower length could be better, because Gregory and Iosef has always been able to visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two strong males, who swallow a bunnies of Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary public audience is that Western culture can do everything for a money.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even make it with our own more recent history and with the ihlava.</seg>

<seg id="1214">In addition, the officials introduced larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two people were arrested during the same raid in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects, there were German arrest warrants.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Therefore, the two are probably extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">In the promotion, Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of more than 300 police officers were deployed.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The members of the Mafia organized drugs-criminality, severe violent acts, kidnapping murder and robbery and compressive disorder.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Already since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor found collateral against organized drugs in the South German room.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the prosecutor in Constance and Palermo, an exchange of exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Therefore the large insert on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four civil servants in Palermo.</seg>

<seg id="1230">Shortcomings of the data that registered data could lead to part serious failing in asylum procedures, in a analysis that the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" will be published.</seg>
<seg id="1231">According to the registers, ten million people are recorded with a foreign nationality, including $5.7 million from non-EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data are therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Because the data is not adequately cared for, the data quality has not been well done in parts.</seg>
<seg id="1234">In all cases, data were found from 1921, "by people who have long since become longer live, or of citizens, who have become German citizens and actually no longer appear in the registers."</seg>
<seg id="1235">"defective data inputs can significantly slow down back processes," it says to the report further.</seg>
<seg id="1236">In the statistics on the travelers of travelers, the EU citizens are considered to have not to travel.</seg>
<seg id="1237">But such false assignments introduced "to a distorted debate on the dealing with outbreaks," therefore, it is therefore in the analysis.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Meanwhile, the Federal Government apparently began to return refugee families with 16-year-old children to Italy when they arrived from there.</seg>
<seg id="1239">This is from an internal paper produced by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), the "Neue Osnabsent Newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="1240">In the paper, this means that BAMF conduct these procedures "regarding families with children - except for infants and infants - according to Italy since 1 June 2017."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and weakening of inflation the speculations about an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warns that economic growth "contracts" will remain when she retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened print.</seg>
<seg id="1265">With 6 to 2 in this month, the political decision makers of the Executive Committee (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates on 0,25%, because the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase in weak economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="1266">The Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2017 and warned that pressure on households would continue to rise to just under 3% in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But they signalized that in the next few years, interest rate would be necessary to breeding the inflation of Brexit and it said that the loan should be expected to rise by more than expected to financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mammoth economic package that was published before a year after the Brexite.</seg>
<seg id="1269">It will require time for the financial plan to allocate the financial budget for banks, although it was said that it is now expected to make 15 billion pound more in the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds Sterling.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Minutes after the decision on the interest rate the Bank said: "in the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak, because the pressure on the real one of households will continue to raise the consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">In interest rates, she repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" to cooling down inflation and a "slightly larger" size would be expected to expect the markets.</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets showed the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">The Bank, however, emphasised that increases gradually "gradually" and "limited."</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank forecast downwards ended downwards for this and next year, 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It maintained its growth forecast for 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision to no change comes after the most recent disappointing growth figures have increased expectations on a interest rate and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months rose to 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1279">Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, even though it's easy to recover by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1280">The most recent inflation report offered a little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and a slight wage increases, as the disappearance is even worse before they become better.</seg>
<seg id="1281">She added that the monetary policy in the coming years cannot be "preventing," but she added that wages grew significantly "at the end of their three-year forecast."</seg>
<seg id="1282">The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, which is attributable to weak Pounds, which will compensate a part of the lower consumption expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes to a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25% in the last August after the shocking EU vote, which caused the sinking of the funct.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Prior to the last judgment of the Bank to interest rates, the call was increased after an interest in interest, because inflation increased the pressure on hard to hard-urged households, with three political decision-makers requested to rise to 0.5% in July.</seg>
<seg id="1286">The inflation in the past month rose from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that its aims at its aim at its goal of 2% is to be "entirely" to the weak Pounds.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Andrew Montdale, director at Coreco Mortise Brokers, said: "in view of the shortest response in swap rates, mortgage market is likely to be stronger again, since the credit or credit is expected to end in a positive way.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big life live: mezzanine and clever designer tricks do this small Earls Court apartment in a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 by a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It's located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne did not packed their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I was living in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown in Earls Court in Earls Court and had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have been in love with them and made it a special offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled completely.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a single room estate with a finished layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted Joanne reservoir and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height optimal.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, much light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "says it.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, to create 12.5 feet high ceilings and a home which was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to place one another, so that the architectural challenge was on to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">It had to be creative thinking in order to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms that they were stacked to each other, without that we had to gaps to us.</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not just therefore to build an easy platform, but set the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper light window by retinvius is looking down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Silver furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays an role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to work for longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The kitchen is mirrored as a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, interrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jacks of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a smooth space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folded kitchen are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went in," explains Erfan of steel reinforcement, veneered MDF doors.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it's important to it, so when you push the door, very easy glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or like your property is estimated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate company will occur and carry out a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have made it to enlarge the floor area and at the same time high-quality materials, which procure its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create a emotional engagement in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't hide yourself into the electric sockets inside the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">They are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that the apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square meters of something that can be transformed into something quite markedly.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, such as Joanne, you could decide to leave this.</seg>

<seg id="1369">Colin argued that this is not true, but raises Paul before, some owners incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early friidavit that was filed by Colin, he says he hope to strive the battle.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian Legacy writes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides of the law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, the dairy bars and delicacy transactions from the late 1950-ies and in the early 70s one business in Brunswick bought.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They took the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans of the family in Colin.</seg>

<seg id="1382">Only Colin made with SMS to say "I can really say much to say," because the case is before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad, that my brother Paul has decided to accuse me and put our family names through the courts," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the judgment that he tries to fulfil the demands of his brother.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted that Paul and I would like to present in our current dispute," he said and added that he was still looking for a solution. "</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps is planning new Chief of Staff to restrict the media abinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it really.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, it will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the head on a consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met in his first working day with executive employee, he presented a major problem in president Donald Trumps White House which he wants to create: poor information that come into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff to flow information about it - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions when he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Waits diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to count Trump to monitor its media device.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television dates back to decades - and now where he is in the White House, its TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when the Trump is due to unfair coverage it was productive to him to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs," said the former election campaign manager Sam Nunberg in February compared to POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key, Trumps Twitter customary under control, according to six former election campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media use a constant praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter are ever "under control," ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaigns are some know what we do not know - that Trumps Tweets without their interventions could contain more types of ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Probably, we will never know anything about the Tweets that the dump is not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his collaborators make it a lot of times, trouble did not hold it, then their effort was worth the effort.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently avoid that Trump controversy can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people in a White House that are composed of competing parties, are always trying to present their own agenda by promoting Trump material, which may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - quite busy with this history - reported about the preference of advisors to benefit from the President of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react to negative press lines, especially such with damaging leaks, and that he insists to find out where these originate.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Just this happened at the end of February, when someone claims a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff in Katie Walsh, "the source of being at the White House in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Even though Johnson had banned from Twitter because he had offered no concrete evidence, or that it is no concrete evidence that he comments on false accusations and revoked her.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to inquire at the staff of Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">In addition, Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff of Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to control and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove itself as a effective manager as Priebus but Trump is still his impulsive self, and its consultant still continues to influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These indisputable factors make the waiter mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1429">The travellers have their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealous road from Solihull road that is called the "millionaire series."</seg>
<seg id="1430">They have brought horses, babies, and an army of transport, after they had been thrown out in May, without having gone down from a council excavated by the Council to prevent their accidents.</seg>
<seg id="1431">The takeover group found a gap in the defence plants and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">The inhabitants of Solihull chose the advice of Solihull, who said that it is "useless to deal with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1433">An anonymous occupant said: "they are pulled there on Monday evening after they were re-sent from Bentley Heath, where they were thrown onto the passers.</seg>
<seg id="1434">The Council must be forced through Scham to the implementation, as he was using the problem when dealing with the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1435">The travellers were there in May, and they moved back now.</seg>

<seg id="1437">She added: "the Council of Birmingham knows how to move around to protect long submissions to protect your parks.</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is made from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house prior to the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing of the hotel Birkenhof due to the public ambience of the company mbH about the 13th of April 2014, some 30 000 overnights was lost per year and also proceeds through the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of a dramatic increase of refugees who came into the County, the hotel building as a collective accommodation was offered, which was offered for controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by the installation of a building plan to secure the area as hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at the time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all the Freudenstadt Julian Osswald did defended the hotel location and spoke at the time of serious interested people to the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabers bought the former Hotel Birkenhof at an voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The Group has four houses with the Freudenberg property.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabers and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">They are called Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the earlier Hotel Birkenhof, since a longer time construction container in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, a substantial renovation work will be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were torn out, ceilings to part disassembled, old bathtubs out of the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Much to March there is much to do.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's really a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the input range is modified, the new window will be installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">All that would be "nice" close, "as Thomas Scherer expresses itself.</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of gem."</seg>
<seg id="1467">The pool, wellness area and meeting room are among the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Not place in the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, emphasises Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wool is extended wide, explains scissors.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Groups or businessmen are to feel at home in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Conversations with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism director Michael Krause already led, so scissors.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The performances of the city are the same with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">After the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under one million euros, he reckons.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The external plants are also brought on the front, which is clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard there is a large terrace, which is publicly accessible from the restaurant that is publicly accessible.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: us Collabmediator sets a Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In Russia's affair around US President Donald Trump is intended to be a special Grand Jury based on Robert Mueller according to a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The panel recorded work in the past few weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote under appeal for the people.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper presented the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN reported that there were already first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services accuse the Kremlin to have targeted systematically in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller is examined whether they spoke between Trumps campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men will be interested in electoral campaign as a consultant of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">In addition, Mueller took more and more drumps of private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post, "wrote some weeks ago that the special mediator is personally put into the centre and subdued the allegations whether the President violated the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to prove this evidence in possible uninterruptions and decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called for count chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are turned on when it concerns larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure will always be closed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The board can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to the hearing of Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN transmitter, pre-invitations were shown to turn the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">You should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. there were also Trumps consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his damaging struggle with Paul Manat.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the objections show that Mueller shall not be sober in his work, and that it should be necessary to act fast.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it is not inevitably hot that the Grand Jury will be turned on by the end to decide on the survey of an accusation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the onset of the new phase of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern the concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President on Thursday evening gave an address in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The topic give the Democrats a way to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about that they can talk. "</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb declared in a statement that he was ignorant of the Enforcement of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this also works in salms, stressed that he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special mediator on "fair" mode.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey had said three times that not to be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to accept that something has changed it, the name was called in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">However, Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this allegations, the accusations against Trump has become noisy, so he would like to violate the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to setup the investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is due to the investigation on a large pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to the presentation of US media, the White House collected materials against the special mediator and its staff.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Which disbanded speculations about whether Trump Mueller is released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Differently, as an independent special mediator of the Congress, as in the Watergate affair around the later restored president Richard Nixon, Mueller has created a position in which he theoretically could be taxed by the president of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several transmitters of both parties want to prevent a step by step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and democratic deficits on Thursday bills, after which the special mediator could not be released more so easy.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic Eisberg accelerates in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Arctic, a gigantic iceberg from the barely seven times size of Berlin from Schelfeis solved.</seg>
<seg id="1520">The cereal Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Oceanic Research was distributed on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The one trillion tonne heavy and 5800 square kilometers large Koloss toss well after the north and will probably take two, three years until he was melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice giant, the researchers have registered over the last three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what kind of climate change played a role in the demolition of the ice, is unclear after research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual clashes of iron pipes in the region, writing the U.S. Research Center for Snow and ice (NSIDC) in a matter of fact.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, these can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The finnulene Koloss was so far a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floating on the sea and is driven by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is still growing on the sea and break off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">At the north of this shrine, the balance of waxes and break down some few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete shot was crushed there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge is never withdrawn as far as at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stood under voltage and could be broken down, if you breathe out a slice at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg exalts a sea level, as they swim in the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melt itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the scrap will make that the glacier go directly into the sea and far away much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">That could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a low degree, the British research project describes the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest shrink of Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the foot of the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, on the front edge of the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">It refracts from there regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural events and does not make any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most notable retreat since the beginning of records," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists is controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will return soon and may be merging and perhaps together, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researcher did not return to climate change this gigantic scrap market, so in the past decades a very many skeliness of the Antarctic Peninsula are broken.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long type of Antarctica extends in South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data of the British Antarctic Peninsula, the Antarctic Peninsula is covered by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase of temperature increase was contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula increased by around three degrees in the past 50 years, thereby fill in the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1585">"we can only assess all accusations that are currently raised, after we have collected all information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had the boat from 'Youth Rettet', who monitors the Iuventa since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that his crew can board inflatable migrants to board them directly from trafflers, and that the smugglers can be used to reuse their ships.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was supposed to have been held only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the acquisition of the government, whose contents of Italian media has been published.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected of suspects over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct boats have to have boats such as the Iuventa to board an Italian police officers who supervised their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have now been ready to keep in the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessarily but acceptable, as they had no significant changes or disability "their rescue actions.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>

<seg id="1595">"in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.</seg>
<seg id="1596">He gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants attempting to reach those countries in the hope of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Anstents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region for four days and enjoy the sights.</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three taken Guides available.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for touring tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took over hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">It was followed by observation points, partly on towers, of which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer forest and the advanced levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Between there, there were over longer ascents for the long Trials.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day there went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the People's festival market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again the lookout point rises to the lookout point, connected by "flowerge" Trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">At the last two days, many altimeter were added again.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and trafflers brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">The Biker in Bad Dürkheim atmeten opened the Biker in Bad Dürkheim atmeta.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had learned the Pfälzer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - league equipment for E-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Sitting the sport-stars in the future of computer consoles, instead of sweating with wind and weather over the stadium to fight?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: E-Sports is long ago to become a serious business, become a lucrative business - great stars, millions fans and huge tournaments with high gings inclusive.</seg>
<seg id="1615">This also revealed the first German alligaverton to engage increasingly in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The VfL Wolfsburg won the VfL Wolfsburg, later with the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart, who founded a e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire all new young target groups for the VfB," says the Management Board of Jochen Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="1618">It is certainly, "that on this train, it is still going to rise again."</seg>
<seg id="1619">At the coming weekend the FIFA World Federation organizes FIFA in London the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Also Robin Dutt looks great potential in the E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now has a agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"the real football must be mined in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds that the young people go into the stadium," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: in a tempting, all possible markets, mainly the Asian, to conquer.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could far be present online by more often on these markets, than once again in the year the federal ligaments to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">Why is it exactly?</seg>
<seg id="1627">When the E-Sport will play computer games like "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or even the football-simulation of FIFA in competitions.</seg>
<seg id="1628">Long ago, as in normal sport, Ligen have been established, in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And with Asia, E-Sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But are there a correct sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the introduction of the future is secure.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobotic also has intersected with the question too.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports- Academy in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reaction, which can also be found in classic sport - for example increased heart rate issues, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it has cognitive performance, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast responsiveness.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only be at the console but also exercise their physique and take care of the diet.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fitte Player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">Frobotic also provides problems: "doping is always more an issue."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult in online games, and in the scene, the structures of classical Sports are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The researchers have a positive impact on the integrative effect of E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are international on the road, which is like a big global family, there is no intercultural shirts.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study of the corporate consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) states an rapid growth in the E-Sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, primarily on advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales will be around 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Against the nearly 2.4 billion euros in the soccer league, this is too little.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the E-Sport "is not far away from the other established sports cards such as handball, basketball or ice-hockey," write the Deloitte's consultant.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already farmed.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Large markets are Asia and the USA where ex-basketball hillage Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez is participating at the US Team NRG eSports.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in the eSports Car Company Unique.</seg>
<seg id="1649">A lot in Europe also does a lot.</seg>
<seg id="1650">In a Norwegian school, E-sport had been introduced as a teaching class, says Frobotic.</seg>
<seg id="1651">In the Netherlands and France, the football-first league-Vera has now been obliged to set up a e-sport department, according to Dutt.</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison Germany," VfB-Management Röttgermann explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">To fall in nostalgia, and clarify the ancient times, today it is no longer enough.</seg>
<seg id="1654">It is therefore necessary to preserve the tradition of the Society, but the company is set up on the modern market at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in an digitalized world," says Dutt.</seg>
<seg id="1656">"I can't hold it from it, only while football will remain, as it was always."</seg>
<seg id="1657">Poison-Eggs - The egg-alternatives for cooking and baking</seg>
<seg id="1658">Almost all states are affected by the scandal to giftload eggs.</seg>

<seg id="1660">Only eggs are supposed to be taken into the shelves, which contained no Fiproil.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Michelle Carter because of the lyrics, sentenced by Conrad Roy to suicide in prison,</seg>
<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years old because she encourages her boyfriend and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Michelle Carter, now 20 months, will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to proof.</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 13 July 2014, Carter was sentenced by his death on his casual killing of Conrad Roy.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter allowed to stay free until his appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">She had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both them as Mr Roy had suffered from a psychic illness.</seg>
<seg id="1669">In red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter faced with tears in eyes, with folded hands and downwards, when she was condemned.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have been killed by Conrad Roy," said the Prosecutor's attorney.</seg>
<seg id="1671">"she finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">She has no responsibility, "said she.</seg>
<seg id="1673">"it has no Reuter."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carters Attorney said that it was a "awesome surrounding which they have completely regretted."</seg>
<seg id="1675">Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find out that their age or ripeness or even her spiritual disease have a significant influence on their actions. "</seg>
<seg id="1676">A Prosecutor read a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy, the promised that there is no day when I didn't pray the loss of my dear Son.</seg>
<seg id="1677">I want to be proud of that he is proud of me, and how I go with all. I try to bear with all my pain, which we are for eternity with us, for his sisters there is it.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Roys sister, Camelyn Roy, said that she will be prosecuted by the knowledge "that she never would never participate in the wedding of her brother or would be an aunt for his children.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no more this one person to have, with which I was together since my birth, is a pain, whom I will keep for the rest of my life always with me," she said.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a lawful precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to claim another committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In the case, national attention turned to itself, after Carters reveal his messages that she encouraged him to finish his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hands formed on, spring from a building, make you living yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news, which she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the eyes of his suicide she wrote: "you must do it, Conrad, and" everything that you must do is to change the generator, and you will be free and be happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz told that Carter sought out his attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any doubts.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">To the few that Carter defended, Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murder on her British fellow worker in Italy, was acquitted when he was acquitted two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Ms. Knox, 30 Years old, published a Commentary in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."</seg>
<seg id="1689">Joshua Kimmi: learning from the new Mini-Lame of FC Bayern</seg>
<seg id="1690">That Joshua had no coincidence at the Audi Cup at the Audi Cup, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern traut the Confed-Cup winners a great season to get paid extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Something was different in the cabin, that saw Joshua Kimmi immediately, even if the additional dress piece is very, very small.</seg>

<seg id="1694">"the trainer did not cover it," told the Confed Cup winner, after his first use as Bayern captain.</seg>
<seg id="1695">Well, the stand would have better run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Napoli.</seg>
<seg id="1696">But the sign of the Coach I was able to suggest that too.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Not the eight year old Arturo Vidal has been in the age of young artists, debut, and just chosen from a holiday with professionals existing C-Elf as a player leader, but he.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Sugl is distributed to those who want to keep much for those who want to keep in the mood.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Those who then chose the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1700">KimmI confirmed: "this is what you want to do as a player: responsibility".</seg>
<seg id="1701">On Wednesday, the 22-year-old teamed up as a mini-lame about the field.</seg>
<seg id="1702">Right behind, this is now its position, the white Binde at the arm and the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1703">And at all, Kimmi worked in this start-formation as the one who can take the Ruder on the best in hand.</seg>
<seg id="1704">He gave instructions, tried to turn the unfinished troops.</seg>
<seg id="1705">He had the look for the whole, while many others were busy themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Vidal to play his missing fitness (didn't work hard); Renato Sanches sent to connect to the achievements of the Asia-trip (folds also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süver thus did not drop to their first performance in Bavaria-Tribes.</seg>
<seg id="1707">This was just fine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">Süver ran next to Kimmi, Rudy in front of the army, both agulated southeastern.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The characteristic of Napoli was often heavily damaged, and the swelling also tried to play a few times.</seg>
<seg id="1710">His colleague Rudy gave us that the result was "not so, as we hoped for us."</seg>
<seg id="1711">But he also showed a regular performance at the debut.</seg>
<seg id="1712">Gaming action, speed change: "for this style I was also picked up."</seg>
<seg id="1713">As usual, these Bayern world still looked for the new separation, one looked into the game.</seg>
<seg id="1714">For example, Rudy was not one or two, but determines six or seven interviews.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimmi passed away after a few crisp statements in his new co-player.</seg>
<seg id="1716">There he listened to an interesting movement there, "what happens here, I've noticed now.</seg>

<seg id="1753">Daimler announced that there were three million Mercedes vehicles to be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines will apply as carcinogenic and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers, installations to neutralize the exhaust gas emissions from diesel vehicles, also take what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>

<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly newspaper Ridence usually meet Wednesdays, in order to review their plans for coverage of the youngest chaos within the State Sinaloa by which organized crimes, corrupt civil servants and unaudible drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shade of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high ranking journalists discuss what safer feels: they are going to take their children with the office, which were the goal of an attack with grenades, or at home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words at a panel on the front of the room: opponent, Neutrale, ally.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter, name for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abdominal feeling.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug traugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists that are suspected of standing on the salaries of the government or the cartels, a catalog of publishers who make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no glory of violence, and while in all the country the corpses are frequent, there are more journalists: at least 25, since then President Enrique Pena Nieto had taken his post in December 2012. 589 are subject to attacks and threats under federal protection and so far there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, their editors and the inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is deeply impressed, although its presence is present - a great photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporter in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show its smiling face with glasses or typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared topics, trauma, its nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although the Special Tribunal for Attorney was set up in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with the ten thousand of Morden, which are connected to drug trading and organisational crime, the murderers of journalists are only seldom charged.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still consist of treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are untraterly and although the terrain is now even avenged.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting with the discussion of safety, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, to turn my time in this workshop" he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know not the why we are mistrust."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was set in two men. it was shot out of his car and 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius was gone away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours along to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But for the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing as silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans's arrest in the past year and the extradition in the United States in January was become Sinaloa to one of the most bloodless battlesions of the country, since rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is filled with panelled, two-story mausages for drug may, which are bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Remember for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cardboard control over the coastal area with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States has.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the fault that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two abnormalities have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first, in February the publication of a interviews with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the riveting antitrust fractions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may be denied those sons, as soon as they bought the edition, as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was to force Valdez not to force, after the seizing of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country to its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long surviving that his friends and colleagues said that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars in holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without at the smoke poison problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">In time the newspaper proved to be a reputation for the brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter lodges it, hard-throw investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody would deal with anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Rifice, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors" Cabot Prize, "for its coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage to defend the Mexican drug history, where they always led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to keep alive," he said at the time of CPJ-Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trading in Sinaloa, is a way of life, "he said in October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you need to take the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team measures Valdez, the Spaak, who was fluent like a docklabourer, the friend who was generous with hugs and raters, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He always would go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there always sat on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to ask her own concern about how they can do their work on the best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like to act with their wives, their children, their little shops, their home and runways," to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of selfensorship and self-maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">When it smells wrong, run away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be disappointed... and then the thing with Javier happens."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, how he and others say they are in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative inocytes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees arrived from Riodoce to safety training, suddenly there were no mobiles allowed. days previously announced that spyware that exclusively sold to governments to the monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside the heat, two policemen kept protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) inside a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in Purz, some of the reporters asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who are considered not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporter have gone into the mountain landscape where the drugs node facto are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has roasted on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">It was the assassination of the brother of the former Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé for the state spending that focused on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group consisting in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about that which was kidnapped or as it happened, so it was attention when it was time to write what each in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally run by drug hands and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a politician who ruled the Institutional Revolution Party (pri), who ruled almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several pri governors were accused of corruption of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">In Villarreal, Villarreal prayed the reporter over previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman went out to a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before, the readers of Valdez visited the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we did know what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its streamlined body nature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"all channels of communication with our sources are broken up."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez office was added to the storage room for signs and stickers, dedicated to the Morde of journalists, because the employees have become something that they had never expected to say: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grab a few signs and passed on the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalists to the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">An burned body was discovered and civil servants say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In all the country, journalists were stronger when they had written in organized protests by SOS Press. "</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day the director Bojorquez was gone into Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accuse the authorities to exploit journalists and to kill journalists because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has therefore asked that she is again divided by the government, because she is concerned that her rage does impoverished their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organisational crimes committed by the government officials and a constant society. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drugs, but also on the orders of politics and security forces that were organised with organized crime under a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media group "Articulo 19" presented more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die, because they would like to hold the mouth," he said Ramirez.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Apparently, the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No man forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas 6 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Their body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas-Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some stores have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern marijuahua, after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others do continue, as El Manana was born in Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its Director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed to the drugs box with an editorial article on the title page with heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home country or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It's hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and search for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer of Ruben Espinosa, who in 2015 together with four women in a residence in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue to stay and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra who once wanted to be poets, is that the drug trafficking off him.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to Hell, and therefore I became reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodosia close to the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to sump.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting stars with banding rivals and security forces near the Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued, as it was promised by a number of cartel-messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the border stone, you have published news on the website of Riodoce about mobile.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heats near to - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were in willingness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid, they did not show them.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Among the huge portrait of the fallen green of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the employee of Riodoce followed its traces.</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you do only remember," said Bojorquez, "if the same day was murdered on the same day when the intern was assassinated, she asked to send them to the road."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to soak up his enemies.</seg>
<seg id="1923">In the first sight it looks like a statue, even if a frightening.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now, researchers have found that the first findings of an incredible rhinoceros in a Canadian miners have been well preserved that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even determine that his flaky skin was of reddish Braun - and they said that she had had something of a "troubled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the "Current Biology" published him as the admonstering Panosaurs, which was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly good preserved condition has researchers that it really describe as "really remarkable"</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, it is the best preserved fossil fossil species in its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn funk, when he appeared in Suncor Millenium Mine at Suncor Millenium Mine close to Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He arrived at something that appeared from the ambient rock on the plateau at the circuit, and decided to look more precise.</seg>
<seg id="1932">This fossil discovered the Fossil and was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy ground.</seg>
<seg id="1934">According to all these hard work, the finished result is ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you twinkles only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has been slept," said the main autor Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is represented in the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant stress, although it is covered with a armor, and resembles a wall-changing tank, probably threatened by meat fressant dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly tilled dinosaurs was a red and white camouflage to hide themselves in front of smokes, and used a shielding technology which is known as the countershading which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to avoid his enemies, experts predict what was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creative creature from the Nodosaurier family has first made headlines in May and has now been seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and studied at Boreopelta markmitchelli in the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of sheds and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shaded shaded, a widespread image method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the convocation is customary, the results are surprisingly, because the size of the magnopelta size is far beyond the living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was chased by enough pressure through meat-stress dinosaurs, the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the convocation - think about Rehe, Zebras or arquail - are much smaller and violate as a prey, what is signalized that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong Raubtier behaviors on a massive, strongly geared Dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs robes have had been to have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs is red brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists will continue to examine the animal on critics about his life, including its preserves in order to figure out what it did as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, fell into a river, fell into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta were as warm as south-fluorida, and rivers and oceans probably spreading much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really interesting because it is completely covered with preservative skin, but also in three dimensions, and the original form of the beast retains," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal today looks like in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use your imagination to reconstruct it. if you only have a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropemitting diodes, fleshing dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, the earth was stripped.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, the tabled dinosaurs was chased by some of its furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthefrus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings were published in Current Biology, believe that Boreopelta died after death in the sea and fumbled in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn funk to the Suncor Millenium Mine at Suncor Millenium Mine close to Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the extinction of the dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely covered by muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures had an average of 18 feet (5 meters) long and spent up to 3.000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that were raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the tilled plant stress was shemulated by the western Canada until a flooded river is flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the water content of the dinosaurs kept his armour in fine detail detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The remains of this special specimen are so good that the skin tread still produce wooded tank panels along the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1966">Like Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preserving so 'rarely like a profit in the Lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more effective.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Remnants of skin still cover the holable tank-plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spun up.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the sheds on his sole '.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the thunderstorm: mass arambolted on the A8: many injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">Serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous landmarks, a short distance of climbs and gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">At the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), around 20 people have been injured during the end of Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police, at 17.00 hrs between the interjoining Order Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg), during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, among them probably also lorries.</seg>
<seg id="1976">About the exact number of injured reports did not contain any information.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It would handle light to moderate serious injuries, said one Polizeisprecher.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large supercharged on lifeasts was addressed to the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of Munich there was a ten kilometer long retreat in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Like a AZ reporter, it also occurred on the opposite track to massive disability - by numerous gaffers.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The Fire Brigade quoted the label of the vehicle lenders who now have to calculate with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 there was still a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">It was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: Group tester "Comfort Check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced at once: nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or you are deepened in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffered.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Returns the Schaffner and wake a unsafft or strike the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of the breaks are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing free ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">One confirms simply by mobile phone that it is taken to its place and evaluates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, there is a trial operation on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer goes on, we extend it.</seg>
<seg id="1997">It is expected to be available in many other distance routes in Germany from the beginning of next year, "said a Bahn speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" is called the bahn Card devaluation without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use them, some prerequisites must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to booked an online ticket - what you're already doing most passengers already.</seg>
<seg id="2001">In addition, it is necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way of ticket sales.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "Comfort Check-in" works: one gets into the train, calling out his ticket under "My tickets".</seg>
<seg id="2004">With the test customers then an button for electronic recovery is released.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The access components can be found on their mobile devices that Fahrgast X is located on the train and has taken the booked seating area Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Comes the train attendant with the ticket control to place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already enclosed online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">You can keep going on, continue, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the subway - which again is to use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who wants to travel without ticket control through our trainee crew, checking in the DB Navigator just yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables the passengers to create their travel time in the train personal, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director of DB remote traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "and our employees have more time than today to go to individual customer requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often walk, knows that besides delay and missed trains, the ticket control checks are one of the largest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">For often, in any case one of the travelers does not have any documents necessary for the use of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either case the credit card or the number of identity card or otherwise a document needed.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The consequence are endless discussions between allowances and passenger, which leads to poor mood in the part or greater and delays in the control of your own tickets and will take care of the workers at the end of the time to worry about other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this is only available on the ICE connectors at the 915-Stuttgart and ICE in Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Further train numbers on the same route are not unlocked.</seg>

<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she repeated her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary cinema, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11th century.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and Protestes, the love and the power of power, strength and strength, which live from the perspective of the people living in the community and have filled the streets to ask answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When herell brought up with her daughter, who brought a flower dress and a right crown, following Ferguson, discuss the two a talk, that they had countless times in front of this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you recall how I have taught you when black people have to fight for war on what they believe?" recalled her what she said.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson because the police killed a 18 year old boy, and that wasn't really correct.</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take her again, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You need to know and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution, and what we must do to free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have the luck, you have experienced an experience in which she personally experienced no detachant racism, it is not unlike the next black women's child.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, considered the activists of the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter have joined a local partner, who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them on protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">A few weeks later, Ferrell hit Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document, "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question was Ferrell in mind: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from white - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">How folayan explained in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised up their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field that is known for his activism rum-mates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell the project closer, along with six other native locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" was shot in the years after Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people will be represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was to focus on Ferrells experience - in order to show that it concerns a Messiah leader, but around a community, "said Folayan - she turned out to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a consequence, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life as she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughter than she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that at this work and when decent of black people need to give a certain danger."</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells history repeats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012 marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media to identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and thus we are fighting for various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gays women must bear the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is really kept of black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is no real type of action," which was chosen by ferrell because of their identity as the heart of the movie.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"it was the person who played this energy, she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's not a coincidence, although it was in front of the front because with a life of these clocks than a black, sgay woman is so much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">The news service in Ferguson has long been disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police remains.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social awareness of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless they were committed to singing and she feels like a memorial to go to the street three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love one another and support one another.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "size of size": TV readers discuss their bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although they are not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern part of the pedestrian zone since the first presentation of 2009 the population in fears and adversaries.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The subject leaves no cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed at our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery: "it would be a dream of" (Anja Becker) or "This would be a real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "does not need man" (Siggi]) or quite simple: "size of wahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocate decides that a gallery attracts more clients to the city, of which the other business also benefit, fear the opponents that then the pedestrian zone is heralded.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Furthermore, the gallery is planned for the property where the farmers market stands, in which 13 Directors shall be marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction is to be finished with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - including the Beda Square with the opportunity to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying almost weekly in the peasant hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the country men always liked very much.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have discovered the butchers for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">There are also other cities in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "if the market is marketed in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of rent is available.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The new project could probably not be low. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: what is the shopping place in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugish or supermarkets: I find the superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Of course there are enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market there, it is more important that us remains at least the Markthalle.</seg>
<seg id="2111">For after all, the product offered there is fresh, is mainly offered directly from the producer and is obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop stores in a shopping mall only are rented out of larger firms, because the rentals are often not portable for a single retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special shops are almost no more and that, what else is left, will probably still disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Wandel: "a shopping center with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the peasant market during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even at duration when the bit gallery actually comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it manage the ghost bit gallery already to drive out all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it's just not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center, which is empty, does not need any one.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to promote a real estate market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a small market hall, there is no more space thanks to the madness many - how I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant marker is made, again a piece of culture will vanish. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, that are almost invisible, that depend on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-troupes and Haarlem created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the cuttings from Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analytics took a 35-year-old prison, having publicly called diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondent between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has been transformed into technology, computer science, and art, and he was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only had three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg originated by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that could be likened from the genomic data, such as someone could not only be interpreted to the formation of DNA data - the many wise men as they can interpret and the inherent determinations of these interpretations, but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, born in Bradley Edward, but already spoke about the identification as a woman since her Puberty, was convicted in 2013 because of 20 accusations, including six violations of the spy law, computer and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison the image was suppressed, so very that there was only one single photo - one piece of grain, black-white befie, in the maning is relatively unlikely to a driver seat and carries a platinblonde perate - it was associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of its 2012-project "Stranger Visions."</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist portraits of strangers from forensic Artefacts like cigars and chewing gum, producing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg at a press exhibition of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at that time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her mapped Muse became unobese of Brieffemunden, who ruled several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They had called even one of the Shoili Kanato illustrated comic "Supplied images," which would convert a future when the President of Chelcius would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama had actually only few days after the book was released, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome way of happy reunion.</seg>
<seg id="2141">It is also available at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informant of the government's bearing and against transgender troops to find new, tweeters ways, which he should actually fix it to escape.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the weird timing of all these things, she said that "things happen under a given reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery he called maning with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic disintegration, whose basis gender, breed, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centimeter of Cs and Gs and As described in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg we hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), such as astonishing, at least in biological respects, we all are.</seg>

<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a private room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novels.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how it dives with a hands-free arm in the United States at the United States like King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Create a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was to see in a squeeze music video and was a hatch for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his intimate River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaariah Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I think it was so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," says he weary.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another British artist, Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, which he worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"that's his thumb pressure!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And I always hit the smoke; for when it was kindled a fire because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For somebody who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as he would also be doing.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Ah, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so with old paprika, it is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England, and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I found my welcome party a little over"), it seems all to be true to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle to study the archives and had spent the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyenas of the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscapes, husbandmen, and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes met a decade later, the staff just started to worry about the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said" Oh, wirf it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the period of English Empires, maps, representing what had possessed: "it could mean that land conflict would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Boys, let all go to go! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to go on a wider basis to the English story, including 'The Labourer', who follows the newly built castle, to join the farmhouse of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uproar, the 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasantry arose in this region and I thought, a revolt was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">May the two be connected with each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', who tells the story of the Jesuit patrons, the family Darrell hid seven years during the British Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell is depicted in the 18th century by adding a sarg with stones (a discovery that was only dug only after years later).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family from Scotney: "the lords seemed to be the fitting of it, always back debts and spending money for things which they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men solving their debt crisis by taking rich old women - I present it to me as a bunch well worth seeing boys, with a talent in order to advertise the landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his revenue in the castle, Rhodes on the search of other unique write-experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elseänmäki, the grounds of a plumatory from the early 20th century, which has been returned from nature again since then.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go again," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2322">It was like: "Oh, now I have to do completely with the damn life."</seg>

<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections for the movement of exile-prediger Fethullah Gülen to see the Erdogan as wire drawing of the coup.</seg>
<seg id="2349">For 486 people, which have been directly involved in the coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan was named "Divine gift," since he would give him the opportunity to clean the forces "completely."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But has Erdogan the army really in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="2352">In late February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the heading of "discomfort in the military quarter."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general strike there is a concern with an increasing "Islamization" of the army which manifests itself among others in the abolition of the head of the headings for Soldators, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The large guards at the army and security forces continues to go on.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July Erdogan sent a further 7395 state-fired bullets, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">When it seemed that Erdogan seemed to mark the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">Generals were earlier than the actual lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times pattered them on their role as the guardians of the world military organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory of 2002, Erdogan pushed the power to the power of the military step, not last committed to the reform of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say, Erdogan is now developing a Islamization of the forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," he warned a well-called officer, who sought after the coup attempt on asylum from pursuit abroad, the Turkish army will be "full of extremist and salafists" in a few years.</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this means that NATO could not leave Nato.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The Ascent of Sex robots is real, and we ought to worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that 2017 may not be crazy yet, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robot is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to start their ascent.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eyebox of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"the people are fun on them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey at the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone gel that feels warm, with the human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adapt to its robots, "and it can select everything from the eye-colour of the robot over the form of flipples to the type or the colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will still rest still, as many robots love the "personalities" that would look like a Stepper-Woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The real Botix robot allows for example to adapt their users to adapt their robots to the properties that invent them, such as relapses.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the true companion of Roxxxy Gold sex robot with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of ticipless and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality who is adapted as good as possible," is the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">That's what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She also has her moods in the day - like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired to be fixed on conversation, or it can be "in mood"! "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many undisturbing aspects in this ascent of sex robots - not least because they could replace real human relationships, but the subject of human traits - but the subject to rape, if one goes a step to Frigid (called here: resistible) Farrah, beeing one in most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his site is True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just another sex team.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their birth and its increasing refinement point to a little darker and deeply underlying in our culture, to a withdrawal of gender equality to an option of sex with subjugation as optional adding.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men are naturally not going to keep sex robots, while the FRR indicated their rising popularity, they remain in the fringe of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what's out of the Random zones can be leakened in terms of the spirit of the time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or irritated, until they are given the free market for this.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that these high-developed sex robot in a time to occur in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is an president in the White House, who has grieve women sexual attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrific aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maidservant ') are not the graphical pictures, the incorruptible body and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump but at the moment it feels like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to real women as realistic as technically possible (if also with a Pornostar Proporter).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want to feel human being human being to imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, on the point, when it comes to its "personalities," robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can't be split by their companions or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">You don't have a mediation or background history, nothing, what independency or anything that might need to interrupt the fantasy subjugation.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Differently: they are countering slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to press it in the implementation of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps large performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney for the epitome of healthy human understanding</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a Binsenweisheit of the Trump era that the political attitudes, which have sensor-voters, also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest foothed there were in the USA newspapers with suggestions about how to circumvent compiling with the horror by dump relations.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all supposedly supposedly listen to our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">In less notices the power of Trumps, families have been coached.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this, because my cousin, a left-directional dip that lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity of a common enemy may have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them knows, including Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and very distinct on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to be the dining table, this is certainly a good deal, but it falls in a further context that this also brings significant risks to itself.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the deforming effect of his Presidency has the power to push all the right to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the grate possibility that his mittens of one day do not stumble.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a terrifying long-time scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the Right wing "normalizes" which appear once a comparison to his standards as an incinerary of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I found myself from an active nostalgia for co-making a funny version of the decline, the dog on the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - which both occur in comparison to Trump in fact a very mild offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of Republicans must be spiritually healthy to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to Carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the Carousel of the New York's park department, and the top three dollars that one can spend in the city if there is no caffeine required.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass design on the central cylinder - all clowns are adorable and the animals turn to look full of anxiety over her own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate pering music will give this a notable way.</seg>

<seg id="2490">Software update for diesel vehicles: what you need to know</seg>
<seg id="2491">How does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers at an overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group are software updates for around 5.3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">They are to improve the exhaust-behavior of cars of the Euro 5 emission classes and some Euro 6 emissions.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4-Diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europa are estimations:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action to be mandatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles, the glows software," says Anja Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The power station-Bundesamt (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and from when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">The manufacturers have announced a fast implementation in the next few months, but not called exact date.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler informed us to write every person.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If not due to an inspection, this will be done in their frame.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long do the change come over?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"difficult to say," Say Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The view from the involvement of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"because we have seen, willingly offered the car manufacturers on the topic of the environment so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update take?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Zeiter cannot be to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE are waiting for.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Presumably there would be foreign producers, so Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Is now there a massive amount of Euro-4 cars?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE fears that.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But just in the regions, where passengers do not threaten.</seg>
<seg id="2519">In rural areas there are no impairment losses for older diesel.</seg>

<seg id="2536">The place is already written - suitable candidates are however rar.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been working since 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun, as it gives the press talk.</seg>
<seg id="2539">It reports a varied, but challenging tasks that wait for his followers.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it's true that no application has to be fulfilled for the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for the next possible time a architect or construction engineer.</seg>
<seg id="2542">Thus, - under regard of the regular period of notice - still enough time for a development.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach was responsible for the administrative authority as a subsidy law, candidates must retain appropriate agreements.</seg>
<seg id="2544">For this function wants to keep the city on any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it would not fill them any more, you would have to go up the citizen to the Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the city near the city and itself is important, says Wacker who reports from a good operating lima as well as good mood between the authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">In more than 30 years, some important projects have gathered in office, looking back on the Wacker proudly.</seg>

<seg id="2549">But a varied projects in the future are varied projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla Areas and the low-hoe parking lot are on the side.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The Kinds between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the style of the stadium is still subject to the topic.</seg>
<seg id="2551">The latter alone will strike at about 1.5 million euros in beech, "if we're doing it right," estimates Wacker.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all we wait for great tasks on my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Design is present for a Stadtbaumaster of large playing room.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslachs, its own construction yard and hardness can be highly flexible to many.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"it is possible to move a lot," so Wacker, and the design of the founding plants will ever be lobbying of citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town is as a historical monument, it is important to have "an eye to have it," if new buildings are approved, emphasises the constructive city master.</seg>
<seg id="2558">He carries high responsibility in the Stadtbaumeister.</seg>
<seg id="2559">He is builder, "at the end it runs all here over my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">For care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been present for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been in existence for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also that his successor remains, Wacker: "we are looking for someone who really wanted to be identified and want to remain."</seg>
<seg id="2562">For continuity is not only important for a good operating lima, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Those who want to inherit Roland Wacker should have a graduate studies as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with a degree of architecture in the areas of construction and building instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2564">Civil engineering, civil engineering, civil engineering, civil engineering, municipal administration, urban municipal court with building yard and urban development, including monument protection, including monument protection.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bicycle on lines thrown: southern route lock</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to the police, the blue bike had thrown away the blue bicycle on the rail track in the area of the Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Thus, these were badly damaged, that the heralous freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male singers and search for the night hours after them.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Close to the facts were witnesses of a rosary wheelchair and bike driver had been observed.</seg>

<seg id="2571">The or the perpetrators now brought itself in major risk and also endangered traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2572">In addition to the damage to the Lok and the facility, as well as the delayed flight and the costs for rail traffic, even more-ray customers could come to the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2573">All in all, there was a "significant" to go out, the speaker told.</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damage were fixed on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the south route could be guided without disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Nearly ten staff were dropped on Friday morning, two of them concerned the correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight lifts are not fallen, however, they had late.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch had to be replaced approximately 200 meters upper wire.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meats, dairy products and chocolate could help lenses IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">However, a new study claims that the contrary: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could linens the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The impermeable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States, causing stomach traps and bleach, recurring or bloody attacks, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually caught, flesh and dairy products found to avoid their symptoms, researchers at the Washington university found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins were developing a tolerant intestines which promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure that harmful microbes, that hide themselves in the eating.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to dissolve inflammations are poured out by cells, protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance becomes too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance transport cell in mice was used to carry a certain bacterium in their innards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial art - Lactobacillus Sporteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that encourage tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich diet is tolerable, less inflammatory bootus, if the same system is effective in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral degree in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan worked out a kind of immune cell when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that had been separately accommodated but this did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They assumed that the difference to do the intestinal microbioms of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the stomach intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The dams of mice were DNA sequenced and were found in six bacterial species, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were drawn up in a sterile environment so that they were a intestinal microbiome and they were not developed these kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria overlooked at the immune system, the researchers sent L. reuteri into a fluid, and caused small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of the tryptophan Metabolism that is known as an Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people may protect the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us will protect L. reuteri to our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan annex products in people like in mice, but defects were found in relation to tryptophan in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells are able to control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestinal.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentials may lead high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri to a expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2605">In Manchester United had signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes his debut on Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2: 1 win in Dublin, the final season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins, and impressive in the holder role, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.</seg>
<seg id="2607">However, Matic was excluded from the Blues-Asia tour of the blues and took only 45 minutes, what Mourinho had to improve from the beginning of the Premier League-season.</seg>
<seg id="2608">"he needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in nature, how he thinks - he think football," said Mourinho.</seg>
<seg id="2609">"we will help him to be ready earlier than later."</seg>
<seg id="2610">In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku in the Aviva Stadium, as Mourinho celebrated its start-XI for the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The Independent enthroned in this week that Mourinho could yet wish three more recent commitments, but it insisted that the club has already provided a "fantastic work" to meet three of its four pre-continent.</seg>
<seg id="2612">"three of four to get, for this I thank the club," he added.</seg>
<seg id="2613">"I will be happy when they get four of four, but they have given great trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2614">Boeing "painted" Dreamliner in the sky</seg>
<seg id="2615">The US-aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner to the sky.</seg>
<seg id="2616">The pilot flew in Seattle in the U.S. state in Washington, the drawing started out in Marquette in the U.S. state, and went to the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, that is several thousand kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="2617">The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.</seg>
<seg id="2618">In the shielding, the shape of a Dreamliner was too.</seg>
<seg id="2619">The whole was a cardio test for new engines.</seg>

<seg id="2622">New rash for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2623">As the wind is yet revolving: when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD chief, the Socialist Prime Minister informed the election with a certain concern in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Only no troubleshooting from the party centre, merely a wind wind out of the covenant - such as the most important desire of the election dampers.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz has changed the party, the fundamentally has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-House with growing horror shall keep the events in the SPD-regated state capitals.</seg>
<seg id="2627">What gave Schulz from there since the beginning of the year, would not be described with counterwind in the approach.</seg>
<seg id="2628">It was deep attacks.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And another one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="2630">After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the CDU CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Green Party.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this once again shows: red-Green is easy-to-proof," said the CDU-Secretary Peter Tauber, the German editorial network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising fraction of a Green Party, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) has overthrown into a severe crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the Parliament election his red-green Coalition lost their votes against the opposition from the CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green-German businessman Michael Kellner has summed down the Anglo-Saxon Green-deputies in Elke Tlifejackets to replicate their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The takeover of the CDU represents a clear delay of voters.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Elke Tanuary must immediately give her mandate, "said the German businessman and electoral struggle of the Green network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2637">"this may not be true for all," the SPD election dampers, than in Friday morning, the new hip-message was reached by the Party headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands out after the takeover of the Green Mke Tets for the CDU without their own government majority.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary highlight of an entire series of large and small crises in SPD federations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And no one knows what next comes.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The misery began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue-eye, no more, soothing the comrades once more.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.</seg>
<seg id="2644">It was then clear - and it was significantly worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the spark of Kiel, the Düsseldorf-Pleite sands the party smooth.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades recled in the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when they had turned into a new courage, the G-20 summit arrived from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him the next setback came.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD landing, lost his Nimbus in that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because he was in the crisis communication rather than anything wrong, what they can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then he has been fighting for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Due to the VW-emission and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister President has already been on criticism in criticism.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Miese Switching values were added.</seg>

<seg id="2657">They let him give him since they spoke a stabilization of the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Because of the partiality, because of the partisan internal canopy, there is no guilt in the Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz are not at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">Therefore, the comrade is therefore closed to keep the own rows.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Her wrath is aimed at the greenery, and here especially on the rebellious parliamentous parlifejackets.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and democrawns, such as Mrs. Tomas their own career," says Matthias Miersch, Chief of the partnines in the SPD Bundestag-Parliament, the editorial network Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Mrs Tiro is not due to their person as a direct-canoe, but also elected to Parliament on the list of Lower Saxony, so the Saxon deputies continued.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence it would be that she returns to Mandate.</seg>

<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was at least 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the former Sanmarkings are a "successful project" - it was finally important to promote the interior development, and not only complete new construction areas.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when President on board, was the heart of the event on 17th July in the White House with American building programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, vice president Mike Pence and executive officer of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 States.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter, which was produced in Connecticut, was issued by a yacht out of Maine, a fire fighter from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House demanded the presence of helicopters in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South Lawn, after notes of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMx-1), the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are shut up," answered the Deputy Commander.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was named as an official event by the White House and has not been covered by Brands Hatch.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political harmonics.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the President gave a violation of the reform of health reform that was in the Senate in the middle of the course, and he propagated the efforts to safeguard the governance of government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the plane that is known as Marine One or Air Force One, derived from political reasons, is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But to request your use only for a photo OP, is uncommon.</seg>
<seg id="2735">Trump introduced an investigation into February, when the presidential airplane stood before the background of his first campaigns in Melbourne, Florida, Taxiservices, and his Twitter account is full of messages that complained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is thrilled by the show" Made in America "- the products from all 50 States, which are produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Commander of the White House, Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMx-1 Occupations are often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn to depose the US President in the White House with precise cuts.</seg>
<seg id="2738">At the beginning of July, when Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany, HMx-1 led to the White House 58 exercise sessions.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The flight for the "Made in America" event counted among the training needs of the Air Force for the month, said the official.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helikopter units floorted in addition to this day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers have no burden for one of the other props, which were presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman by Sikorsky said, the company was not involved in it to depict the helicopter to the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMx-1 does not maintains budgeted drawings for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to Stundentarization of the US Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD Award for VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Recording of the unit recorded flight time of an airplane than 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argued that the actual costs for operation of the helicopter can be far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers in the basis of estimates for attendance rates is highly irreleading," said Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2748">"this estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding."</seg>
<seg id="2749">According to a RAND study from 2015, the award kits for DoD does not contain the personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2750">At that time, the former White House, Sean Spade, defended the use of helicopters for the event.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America," said Spade.</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national safety, and I go out that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent on it.</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, for which so many Americans have spent untiring.</seg>
<seg id="2754">It is, of course, it is inadequate. "</seg>
<seg id="2755">It was not clear whether Trump with the helicopter is interacting, when he entered his tour through the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fireman.</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the White House, Trump said to representative of Sikorsky and schersleben with the media on his own fleet of company products.</seg>

<seg id="2893">It would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deepest regret over their own submissions or their then wrong estimation of operations.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican law "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticized that in the coverage of violence among the "two lei" measure. "</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one knows that it would need to be "shacklly and damaged acts" do the power and escape in the future; however, the "degree media manipulation," such as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the iconic church, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and preparing the public mind to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Princes Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "they will be happy to go on the church and this is a matter of hands."</seg>
<seg id="2898">Moreover, they pointed out that in their adolescence, "conclusions were a whole normal-pedagogical agent," in order to be able to get ready. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are fair, to present the standards for earlier decades, because the world have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Entirely wrong, author and historian Michael Eemann, who summed up the book "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages), too.</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection," says Hesemann, "because all that had nothing to do with him, he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440 page report, which was submitted by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domain were victims between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with high plausts" victims of survivors, 67 domains of sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it was said to Georg Ratzinger, which was held in Regensburg between 1964 and 1994: "in summary, this means that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms physically and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">The punishment for the student has just been able to fail.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other cases, in contrast to numerous other states, many victims were assumped the common humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Eemann, why the final report on the failure scandal in the Regensburger Domain, Georg Ratzinger, explains his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report on the "incidents of nonviolence at the Regensburger Domspatzen" is a contradictory picture by Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a lifting of many students "Humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other, it also appears as a Choleriker and perfectionist, which has been handy for the oil, when a Domspatz has no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate it as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front until the rear, it is necessary to ask for that the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to him even eight pages and is clearly acquitted of each suspicion of the communications or co-knowledge in the horrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The nonviolence at the Pre-school took place outside of its efficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can refuse to it, of which too late or didn't have first noticed enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domaine grammar school, on which he worked, was conducted by virtually all respondents than - so literally - "salvation," "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">This also presents the wide majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger, a very excellent record, described him as "warm", "" upright, "" competent "and" understandable teachers, who supplies the guys regularly with cake, cookies and bonbons and "always umberated from children of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is characterized by its perfectionism and its high ealogonality, that led to the outbreaks even times.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only cast with chairs and threw the keys on the ground, but also did earing boys to the hair or ears, he has already been prepared for years ago, deeply saddened and excused for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, in honor of his honor, such guardian were to be widely used in fragile time, 1960s and 1970s, in parents such as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us, born 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have seen that still in a school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with the word that actually happens in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and violence at the preschool, the freili Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Since one asks, if it does not have to do with his acquaintness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just crossed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian pope, there are many who never understood it, still jealous.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media the report was reported much about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domain.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also any processing or wizard with regard to sexual abuse on load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clear no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have committed the domain name.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never made me to talk with my father or my mother," said a person concerned for the others, "It was really all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and yet, that most victims from Scham silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they haven't entrusted to parents and siblings, then, not a choral director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the unemployment rate of Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a fragmenting student has formulated this way: "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he had expected to have thought that he could have been able to win their respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I have to stop it... also for the absurd, to accept that... Buben enurgent or clearer or rather, as opposed to their parents, Internatsleiters, Confidentials etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus the report comes to the clear result: "that the student must be affected by students and / or their surroundings, could not be confirmed in the context of the study."</seg>
<seg id="2942">Regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free of contact with each partiality.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he can't be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, no reason to bring his good name with these contradict crimes in connection, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media a lot of "Violence" were reading at the Regensburger Domain.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown into the "Wegner" report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this offence?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Eemann: this is the big problem that in the coverage all mixed and mentioning a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the midst of, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly what again a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Because it will be clean: between the school and school of the Domsparatzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say once again, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report covers Incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases where the lad of sadistic teachers have been shameful and dreadful, all of them met at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to have ruled.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he had only got her face when she had already been at the Domaine grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that was, like most witnesses, the subject "Preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paraenic" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspaine grammar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Eemann: as a discipline happens, but there was no sadistal force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, at which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims were estimating the common humanity by R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at the most still the allegations still remains.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which the states had been reported on the school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish and from their predecessors at a school where he had not been active and responsible, (such the witness) nothing wanted to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Inside Georg Ratzinger, Georg Ratzinger is consistently the ears attaching?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspine ymnasium, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">This indicates that he insists that in the pre-school it will continue to be practiced. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the risk of negative new press release, he remained urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, it was, of course, as legal clarity, as a test catching also in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also a hard value for him, where the sufferers may have passed exaggerated or dramatic, and where the allowed limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say, he would have gone out.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is not so easy.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said it is unfair to apply to today's educational standards at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "Fallout of Anachronism," thus the danger that insists to evaluate today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Since the princess has been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true for sexual abuse, which was abhamous to all times, and not for what was broken in the pre-school for recharges and violence to innocent children's seas, which is far beyond that far beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all terrible and I'm glad, that it is finally opened.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to discipline and punishments, so earmuzzle and at the hair and ears, they were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he has also kept strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image of his time is Georg Ratzinger, as in the talks with you for the book "My brother of Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the topic: rebuke also to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, because the domains played only one side role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not forget that he led a regiment to it.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must also be said: without these perfectionism, without having unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly possible to form well as national cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went directly to the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour.</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone, one makes no great singers and standing before each success, like this area, but still discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Than what kind of people do you have met Georg Ratzinger during the talks in their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: I really learnt with the work of the book and in addition I met Georg Ratzinger and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep believers and warm good people from which you could not imagine that he could do something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former domain ones still get to him today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and how a member of their family has been treated.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who didn't forgive him until today, that he was once strictly to them, are therefore clearly in minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domain markets are thankful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them into the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, vaful teacher - a strict father, certain that may be like - but also a lovable respectsperson, to whom they still watch and honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And, please, once again clearly: everything that's preferred before him are educational methods that were then on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have overcome this time long.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make the medial sin-bock.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention, that is behind him, just too obviously.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that was just released, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the subject area would have acquired a 93-year-old man who had acquired large merits and without the outside Bayerns and perhaps Germany would probably know no one to know the Regensburger Domain, finally in peace.</seg>
