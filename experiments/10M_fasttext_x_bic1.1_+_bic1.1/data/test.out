gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pil@@ es of pyr@@ am@@ ides
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger , with some colleagues found a bit of variation with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pil@@ es &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered the closing ceremony , they pursued a fast gal@@ lop of the feeding home .
one kilometer at this pace , I have dre@@ amed .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the hor@@ semen ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories , close to horses .
he let himself lead with his family over the system of AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not take advantage of photography .
long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
German sports assistance were submitted to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala golden pil@@ es .
there is no way of awards to the sympath@@ etic sports@@ men .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ sheet , Champions Tour Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already gro@@ unded him .
great is the 18th winner of the pil@@ es of pyr@@ am@@ ids .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner at Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means to me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring since decades .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
the two @-@ time US @-@ Masters winner was launched on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports &quot; for 15 more outstanding athletes .
for the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ ge and Harald Schmit@@ t , who did his real Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander Pus@@ her and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ cker Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ umping Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of handic@@ raft .
many of these sports were come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively society wander@@ ed into the spr@@ ing@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger gave distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and trade agreement T@@ TP prevent both Clinton and tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. presidential campaign , however , are competing in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
he , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warned against it as the state of the economy can hurt - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton had to regul@@ ate the economy and regul@@ ate death , he says .
in other hand it would be very different , asser@@ ting Tr@@ ump .
he will make relief down massi@@ vely , and he strongly turns strongly for a far tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and companies .
Clinton says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , he has advant@@ age@@ ous opportunities to open and need money .
that is why the tax would be increased to the rich , she says .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the infrastructure .
in which to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton will say almost wor@@ t@@ as .
the democratic candidates is announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ach@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
thus , at Tr@@ ump , thus we could still share internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policies are significant .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and drive the coal extraction in the US .
it is also possible to termin@@ ate the oil promotion so far as to termin@@ ate the Paris Climate Agreement .
in contrast , Clinton wants to strengthen and demands renewable energies with their investment program : &quot; a country will make the super@@ power of clean energies and create million jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want to be there . &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , both competitors are not far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , which deal with intern@@ azi@@ fish trade agreements , do not want to sign either .
at the same time , both the United States will not want to isol@@ ate the international trade - rather than just American jobs .
those that are then to be paid better then calls for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US Dollars is a famine .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question isn &apos;t clear : once again he says , the minimum wage must not be changed , then he shall not be changed .
but the great discussion of the next months should be likely to develop the tax policies of both bearings .
on one page is Tr@@ ump , who wants to re@@ lie@@ ve the economy and citizens to stim@@ ulate the growth .
his critics hold him , that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton wants to ask at least of the rich ones that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who flee alone , almost for everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ matic .
a house has refuge .
in a big kitchen there are four women sitting .
everyone has a baby , which is most one year old .
one has placed her little son in the arms .
he gu@@ ises his eyes curious in the room .
his mother is star@@ red on the table top .
till they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iled shortly and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
till we speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is part of Con@@ dro@@ bs Business Manager , a carrier for social aid offers in Bavaria , and among others dealing with the topic women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich north , in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the establishment together with Pro Familia and Munich tra@@ ilers .
it has been officially opened officially .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard from the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they have persecuted polit@@ ically because of them torture or death , or because their families would send them as a hope for Europe , &quot; she tells you . &quot;
in women , some reasons behind the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot;
in her home , she had experience with sexual violence , forced him , honor of honor , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives her away .
on the escape that goes on .
&quot; that the t@@ ug@@ boat is for example a bottle of water a sexual action , is not a rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end , once they are an@@ cho@@ red in Germany , is telling me .
here too , women in refugees would often have been regarded as min@@ der@@ ous and worse .
this leads to about 90 per cent of women who live in the housing in the north of Munich , estimates them .
&quot; some of the children are not purely voluntary . &quot;
many women be as usual that they say nothing .
&quot; or they are not trusted that you have lived to talk about the earth , because the shame is too great . &quot;
since they often do not help to help , it will need more properties for them , asking B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district rule will be responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they would like to know about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction of the jurisdiction , some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there are something like that in shel@@ ters of governments .
in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not separately accommodated but says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press secretary of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle @-@ fran@@ ken is available in some shared floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
in the European Parliament , the &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; also demands that women have to be accommodated separated by men .
in a study published in the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women will be home separately . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or become men and women to be accommodated together , there may be - persistent - violence against women . &quot;
all the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study .
as much of the women of this protection , one can read the And@@ rang , which is located at the Haus in Munich .
&quot; since it has been spoken that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
one could easily start a second house .
assistance for assist@@ ants : requirements according to new working measures
the representative of the assist@@ ants have called for their union to appro@@ ve new working measures with any disp@@ utes regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested his entire Council as of early September more working measures .
the J@@ DC said that there would have been an opportunity to worry about the concerns about the contract .
in July , assist@@ ants and medical consultations have voted on the re@@ jection of a contract which had been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court told that the government would have remained rough , and what led the treaty was rejected .
she said : &quot; in view , the J@@ DC Board voted to re@@ ject the proposed new contract , completely re@@ ject and official new negotiations for all marri@@ ages . &quot;
as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today appointed a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program for a running program , which begins at the beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes resulted in a six times the assistance of assistance in the history of N@@ HS .
according to the election of the BM@@ A , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , head of the BM@@ A , came back after the election of the agreed contract conditions , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54@@ ,000 assist@@ ants and medical consultations that the contract may be advant@@ age@@ ous and adopted .
after the vote , the Health minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors forced to be forced to be in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of external mo@@ vers &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that finished a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give his hands and a official end of the eight months lasting the words and economic sanctions .
but as Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ players in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in receiving , I can &apos;t forbid that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation on most .
it was the hand , yes .
but Put@@ to smile worked nar@@ row@@ ly and it sh@@ ot@@ ined little heat , even for his back @-@ held conditions .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an said to his &quot; loving friend &quot; Putin - according to a report about five times .
I could not count any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to its old level before the crisis , but even further improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an had been too many , than would never happen to be anything .
with me , enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin has had a radi@@ ant , lasting cooling , that the state of affairs did not forget about Russia .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first to mentioned in his sub@@ missions : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft in the Syrian border with Turkey .
Moscow was disp@@ oss@@ essed from reaction to the time .
Putin issued Putin and accused Ankara to have fallen in the back .
the crime was even bigger , as it was committed by a paid friend .
the Vet@@ rop@@ es will be re@@ build again , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
once it appeared , the Turks would bear the debt for everything .
on the most serious , the alleg@@ ations of Chief officials were that Erd@@ og@@ ans would have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has declared this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the charge of the President of the Pre@@ og@@ an President he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire is clearly on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an takes on first place all the friends who can get it after the last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat of his ministry .
repeated terrorist attack on Turkey were also sh@@ aken at him .
but there are economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions hit hard against Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they count on a late ais@@ le ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week the state @-@ television budget also predicted fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural products will be allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara has sh@@ aken the West , since it proved its response to power , proved to be a weak response .
in addition , the persist@@ ing Gro@@ ll pass over the eve of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke insi@@ sts to draw from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west .
in Ankara , the Russian state of State won a bonus that he demanded after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the chosen state organs .
this is well worth a self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility that has to change even a deep fear of rain .
the summit in this magnificent palace at the sea allowed it to Russia and Turkey , one who once described me an analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of external people &quot; states : two countries that are f@@ cast off the west and po@@ or@@ ly covered .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still differences between the two still differences .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace @-@ shar@@ pen@@ ed role , but where Russia and Turkey were supported by wil@@ ful pages .
it might be noted that after almost three hours to first talks both pre@@ ten@@ ers on the press conference , they would have noticed this subject again .
the President of Turkey kept it inten@@ tionally to answer a question about its differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize this .
it is no clear con@@ sens@@ us in front of where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after the months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential of a perfect disaster as NATO member of Russia , the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state should speak at least .
Royal Bank of Scotland for clients outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the Management Board of the Bank , the R@@ BS company has only been reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Management Board of Management .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the L@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
since then , the bank has dist@@ anced , when it had almost collap@@ sed and had to be saved eight years ago .
in this period , brand @-@ oriented &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumers .
she supported the international sport with millions pounds of spon@@ sor@@ ship , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to make more national brands in focus on the back .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alized head office and the stock market launch will switch to Nat@@ West .
the brand of Ul@@ ster bench is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business that will be more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand is being involved in our invest@@ or brand and the brand , under which our employees will be employed , since we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot;
when the bank became a global brand , R@@ BS was introduced to the global brand .
I say now that we do not track global goals , but also local targets .
each of these stamps will work in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with customers .
R@@ BS has already said that its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing will not continue to continue , and that it will increase the perc@@ ep@@ ity of various brands in his sport Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop himself to the bank of brands , for how do we concentrate on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; he said the head of directors .
it would have been very z@@ yn@@ ical 3 years ago when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer requirements and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re @-@ launched these stamps , so I think that the time has come .

Russia &apos;s Putin We@@ ert Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin is un@@ expect@@ edly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the most close confi@@ denti@@ ality of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport issues .
in an opinion of Kre@@ m@@ lin it is stated that Putin has ordered the dis@@ mis@@ sal of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Committee . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was the deputy @-@ representative since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo .
on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it says ( in Russian ) that he later became the director and government leader of the government .
on his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of head and insp@@ ections on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked this to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step did turn mysterious Moscow .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ denti@@ ality Vladimir Putin and works as he has been working for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , who was broadcast@@ ed in TV , both men claimed that Chief of Staff was back on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only few of them convinces - especially in front of the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power combat ?
this is no one knows .
but the official statement - that a man who once was appointed to be a potential President once again wants to forward the Russian environmental policy - over@@ threw in large sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said it &apos;s true that I asked you to a talk in early 2012 - I could almost say this very difficult item - one could almost say - become a permanent position for four years .
as it emerged , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
before he became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin was a former member of the State Security Service of K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service of Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , the K@@ GB was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin met the power he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted in most .
it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov might have been the second term of President of Russia to have been cast off against the Constitution after putting his second term in Putin .
but this item was taken by a further , near ally put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .
British Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson fired , after he killed producers

the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who had played in the Sit@@ com Bir@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was one of the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love the min@@ ds and have turned over my whole heart blood twelve years , &quot; Gibson was published in a message on Friday .

the bridge of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 shafts .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017 .
the Minister of Economy Keit@@ h Brown invited the construction site today and was one of the first to come from the country on the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment for the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross .
we are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly comprehensive degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the bridge between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is an hei@@ k@@ le activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
all in all , almost 79 % of the total br@@ once in their place and the last section of the de@@ cks gets a concrete kiss to the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to place the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first lock represents a considerable milestone in each bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure of the pione@@ ering high and deep construction represents .
after installing the last road cut and its connection with which in the expansion of the north @-@ deck , we had to close the yet existing gap on the north or the country side .
this was reached by pulling the northern ski lift bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
massi@@ vely , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , it weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be withdrawn from a gradient of approximately 3 % .
if the tolerances , on which the team works , they were tiny - on each side , they only lived a few millimeters .
fortunately , everything went very well .

who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs convenient apartments ?
the SPD and gre@@ e people : investors will soon be stronger than the duty in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; action concept home &quot; to the next rat@@ chet .
but dispute is programmed .
first line is the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a scheme is missing so far .
the president of the SPD parliamentary party Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; we are proud to build on urban areas in the future , 20 percent of all apartments in the urban areas . &quot;
the favorable apartments can however also arise in the stock .
but the great contro@@ vers@@ y in the town hall is , however , so viol@@ mann : &quot; how are you going to build with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors at least 10 per cent , but as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social dwellings . &quot;
a new municipal housing program , which will cost millions and will be financed , is supposed to take care of incenti@@ ves .
the problem , so viol@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors a few regulations .
the Lin@@ ke wants to generate hardness levels for investors .
regardless of how the Fr@@ ying , ex@@ h@@ ort an dis@@ appearance of the situation on the housing market .
the concept concept is implemented , will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is required .
it &apos;s un@@ clear whether we get the skilled workers .
but the program is not fully compatible : because the around 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built .
how do you compare the loss of more than 1300 favorable apartments whose funding is going to be run over the next few years ?
by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , as planned as planned spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , you should now be able to buy @-@ off bonds of the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about to pick up apartments back to the price .
this is possible in the western town .
in one stroke the problem can be solved .
because in the western town you can walk to the end of the year at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments can be found there , in the price of a convenient location .
only : this would not want to do the owners , housing companies .
for the number of social apartments in the western town dra@@ stically increases dra@@ stically , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called mixture .
but a concentration of social weak in just a few parts would not give it any more .
the gre@@ ens therefore expect that there is movement in the discussion .
Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke comments : &quot; a large majority must have the CDU with the boat . &quot;
I have focused on more buildings for single family homes .
but what does not mean that still a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it &apos;s fascinating , how the world changed .
that te@@ ens and child do not go beyond the outside , but rather prefer@@ able to spend their leisure time on screens in the last decade of many compl@@ ained .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go there is to take people of the sofa and to be active .
the time on screen was initially set to TV , then video games and most recently limited to smartphones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not connected to each other .
I &apos;m relations with course , of course , on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created for video games in the 1990s ( later produced a animation series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
how many phenom@@ ena of pop culture decreased slightly ahead of the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand which over@@ load the server .
within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than ink , and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players with their Smartphones are going outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who were tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( above a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; caught . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which the &quot; average &quot; person back every day .
therefore , a app for Apple Watch , who pursu@@ es 35,000 users , shared the Washington Post , reported that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed , who j@@ ump@@ ed 30 percent every day , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data for performance improvement .
many public awareness programmes for health , people would like to take &quot; go for 30 minutes &quot; to come &quot; from the sofa &quot; and &quot; every day active in divers ears because many public messages are bor@@ ing to health and come from people that look like .
nevertheless , the meaning of sport cannot be assessed .
those who regularly drives sport , reduces his opportunities to tackle cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that can lead to it here .
but the wonderful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , that it makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people close to the hunting even new friends .
as always , there are also m@@ eri@@ rical toys , which must always be compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it mean ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps had already been doing our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to exercise sport as it does this game .
the new will lose his appeal and the use will be followed by time .
because of poker success it will give you more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activity will be combined into the real world , and so many people will be able to help hunting , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that imm@@ un .
dynamic on the j@@ umping horse .
effortlessly on the beams .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on all line .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ ve Festival ends on Thursday to the multi @-@ finals and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ team kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal in Ali@@ ya Pat@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es immersed in the Swe@@ des during the single multi @-@ finals of women during the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a majority struggle and in total the fifth , while it was their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her end result was shown and its long trip took place at this moment .
this success is in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , which have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es domin@@ ates the last three years , 15 world champ@@ ions - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals and precision , that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary L@@ ou Ret@@ ton of her said that she has ever seen &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was waiting for a final examination in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man im@@ pover@@ ished , after they each have won gold and silver in the single majority of the women during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal at Tuesday , while she stopped at the f@@ are@@ well celebration of the Team coordinator of Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as an excl@@ amation mark .
even though Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on top of her long way@@ marks on the top , never the future is planned , isn &apos;t really true .
a part of their floor exercises - which include their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tail@@ ored to Latin American music , that would fit home at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
that is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and adopted by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school @-@ trip to the gymn@@ asium , was trained into force in Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has no more competitive competition , a winning stre@@ ak , which will hold as long as it wishes .
even though a pattern has easily led by two turns , the picture sli@@ pped .
pi@@ bal@@ es and soil particles - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title - watched .
she won again with 15,@@ 433 on the Swe@@ de bal@@ ks again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor another one gets on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man em@@ bra@@ ced her gently when she anticipated her du@@ b@@ ade - a pure form@@ ality - and tears run on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue e@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision was once described in their collection .
the Ra@@ is@@ man &apos;s performance was a ven@@ geance for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke was painted at the model of Pat@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old cre@@ ams , called by the American &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; is a lead .
after their ground , she re@@ inv@@ aded the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ ek@@ y , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly appeared .
as regards the image , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old child from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning :
police : 3 victims in serious damage caused by car in the car
according to the police report that were shot on Thursday were shot two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl who died in one of the dead@@ ly attacks since a decade in the first series of serious ar@@ ising from Phoenix , while they stopped playing in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot at the 12th of June , while the car was par@@ ked in a pilgrimage , the authorities said .
the k@@ iller mo@@ ist eight shots from a hand fire@@ weapon , while on the driving side of the car stood and fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police reported that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y when the attack@@ ers didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
by Phoenix Rising , the police car by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting started investig@@ ating an investigation , a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
a total of seven people were killed in a His@@ pan@@ ic housing over four months in nine attacks , and two more injured .
in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; I shared between C@@ BS , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is believed to have used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investigations refused to reveal the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks were associated and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died out on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which had an empty Pick@@ up truck one half an hour before the triple murder and was assumed that it was the work of the serial master .
investig@@ ators took Pat@@ ron@@ en@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball bearing fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy with micro@@ recipes : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and natural mother .
but like the least of his aging , Edmund micro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic failure to knew about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I can &apos;t create it .
I don &apos;t create it .
I did not let me go .
what ever is not right ? of course , one has happened on it , &quot; she said .
when Vincent and her husband told her husband Vincent and her husband informed that Edmund could never see them in circumstances and that he may not survive any time .
some doctors even walked so far that they beat him to institution .
&quot; I didn &apos;t know my first answer , I didn &apos;t know that the people still do , &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of a help .
Edmund could not sit up to his third year of life neither cra@@ w@@ l nor talk yet .
but it does slow progress .
he can run and travel with support .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers and singing .
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund for &quot; Please sing me anything . &quot;
&quot; we bring to him character language , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not typical character language -- says it . Edmund has invented some characters in alone .
Mikro@@ co@@ sti@@ ffer has a variety of causes : genetic as well as Edmund and infections with viruses like mas@@ ages or z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
since long time I did not ask for the predi@@ ction because I did not expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has created a hop@@ eful rating for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; accompanied by balls , survived the shooting in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy joined in Philadelphia this week is already the second time that a 6 year old child has been shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several shots ab@@ uses , including in the L@@ ending , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was at his transport into the hospital at consciousness .
&quot; he has a lot of through , his small body was wi@@ en@@ ched from balls , &quot; divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ft Mel@@ en@@ dez to the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe that .
the condition of the boy was classified in a hospital as crit@@ ically and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the transmitter that it is expected to be back again .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town in one of four people .
three men were also shot : two men at the age of 29 and a 32 year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in the critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable condition .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who found himself in a critical condition , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police have just identified whether under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators from C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross between several scar@@ ves .
Pat@@ ron@@ g@@ ages for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ cked to different assault ri@@ f@@ es , over@@ looked the facts .
it seems that there are definitely worth a continuous fight .
on the road , on both sides of the walking distance , H@@ ül@@ sen was found .
thus it seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; shared police h@@ mann Anthony G@@ in@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles were hit in the area .
there came no detention and the police have reviewed reports , according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday a further 6 year old girl was hit by a trans@@ verse ra@@ cket at the arm , played in front of her house in the residential neighborhood of the West Coast Lane .
they recovered and the police will still search for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to register among the Women &apos;s Youth Olympics in 2012 , and that is from more than one reason .
first , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics in 1984 and the US was never so dominant .
and second : this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez for inspir@@ ing many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ kin is , round off every pro@@ ud@@ ly .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has set the black and His@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the past four years , the number one was under female gymn@@ ast .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
Gab@@ by Douglas has rejoiced for the last Olympic Games in America and America .
now , the world was able to be the incredible performance of the three @-@ fold world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez to be as it was unexpected , but master@@ ful gy@@ back rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman , who won gold for women with an individual event event .
man member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but so the gym is not visible throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie also smote the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it in the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . Moreover , it is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a train@@ ee .
but the reality looks as such that Tour@@ naments are a expensive sport and Turner at first line in private turn@@ around that are reck@@ oned by parents for training , training , travel , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs , Turner will receive its entire training , and this is a most expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , train@@ ee of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since it began with the tower .
we have to wait the par@@ ishes au@@ n countless , young girls who will be inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an excellent and easy @-@ to @-@ reach turn@@ around .
I founded my turn@@ table by 20 years .
we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,000 of urban teenagers ( mainly black and His@@ pan@@ ic ) and trained international and international winners .
in September we will have expanded to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to provide the youth of high @-@ quality tour@@ neys to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and ti@@ ghtness for the mind .
this combination has li@@ fel@@ ong benefits for health , as well as for elementary and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that thousands of young girls bring to care of interest and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls .
it is an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic stadium and thank you how to start playing their way to begin healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants wish to organize a further strikes after it rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts Pro@@ pos@@ al ?
the ministers hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the amendments adopted by the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants that descended at a choice .

Dr A. Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ stance doctors fought last night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ants &quot; to heat serious concerns , in particular that it will heat the current occupancy crisis and to treat all doctors . &quot;
at only eight weeks , which still remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
by discussions by the BM@@ A , the BM@@ A efforts to eng@@ age talks with the government on a resistance of resistance and sometimes at o@@ hren@@ ic swe@@ at .
that was the word that Jeremy Hunt didn &apos;t make the last month about it , that his door would be standing .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt has to take action now , lifting up and worry about the concerns of assistance . &quot;
if he do not have this to do this , the assist@@ ants have been made clear that they are ready to perform further labor measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw an impact of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100.000 appoint@@ ments , as n@@ urses and doctors have been involved in to give doctors at the strike post@@ age .
the ministers hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes made by the Re@@ formed contract with the func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week wage for the 54@@ ,000 assist@@ ants that will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS , called for the assist@@ ants to end the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour measures do not reach only little , but lively teams and service providers and prepare patient , nurs@@ ing and their families only worry , trouble and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the composition of the assistance of assistance and related to the Ministry of Health , as well as other minist@@ ries compl@@ ying with regard to the concerns and of the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .

the £ 2 @-@ per day medication which can reduce the heart inf@@ ar@@ is@@ os@@ iko
thousands of heart attacks patients are benef@@ ited from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication , recommended by the authorities to use this more people for a longer period .
the co@@ ag@@ ory medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of recur@@ rent heart attacks for people with a heart disease .

the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by an@@ gathering of fet@@ ich@@ ous materials into the arter@@ ial walls , circular saw .
when the layer breaks out , a blood cl@@ ots may cause blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots trig@@ gers it , it can flow through the blood flow and caused the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who had already had a heart attack a higher risk are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is driven under the trade names of Br@@ ili@@ que , reduces this risk by un@@ likely the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ likely .
the call design of N@@ ICE , which was today published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month administration of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily taking of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE Department of Health Research Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons having suffered a heart attack , have suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ ro@@ sen consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively in the reduction of other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
we are looking forward to a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are looking forward to expand treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the charge design recommends the treatment that proceeds over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ respon@@ ness to anim@@ ate election was in Muslim enemies
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from the office last year on request of a governmental report due to corruption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to it that much @-@ wide election of Muslim congregations will be igno@@ red as a devastating government report today .
the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , election observation and Rath@@ homes to have igno@@ red evidence of &quot; Over@@ all national@@ ities regarding Eth@@ ics and Religion . &quot;
former Minister for Integration and Municipal government , which is now a Ant@@ al inf@@ ectious disease , said that the en@@ rol@@ ment of voters from religious moti@@ ves would be so bad that the police should be allowed , shut down arrows outside of elec@@ toral cord to protect c@@ ashed voters .
he recommends that voters should have a reference to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment , a voters must just call his name and address .
the report proposes , non @-@ dist@@ ressed ink on the fingers of a person when they vote their elec@@ tive voice to prevent any one cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should have more protection , Sir Eric .
he calls for the press more access to community documents and decisions of no official committee or working groups should .
&quot; it does not only serve to elec@@ toral fr@@ aud , but also the municipal government before the bro@@ ader corruption and financial intermedi@@ ates that goes on to protect it , &quot; he said .
the report was ordered by the D@@ ov@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election of London .
last year , a Special Court decided that the reig@@ ning mayor of Lut@@ man for Rah@@ man to the corrupt and illegal intern@@ ships of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; and that he had put his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ en@@ an@@ ap@@ ologies .
Rah@@ man is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis that the reli@@ ant duty of Muslims is to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly or the consequence of a im@@ itation on which one person is cho@@ oses one another .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of gu@@ ile throughout the country .
in particular , he expressed himself particularly al@@ ar@@ ming concerning fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent letters - at the previous members of the Muslim community to people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to nurse the elec@@ toral system , including the Leadership of failure to prove the identity
in its report , it is stated that pressure on the needy members of some ethnic min@@ orities has been exercised , especially women and young people to choose according to the welcome of the elderly , in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ quet background .
&quot; there were wor@@ r@@ ying that ... state institutions ab@@ oun@@ ded these behavior due to &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; over@@ ar@@ ities regarding the eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to dis@@ man@@ tle the system , including the ban , to edit political activists , to stop &quot; Ele@@ ctions . &quot;
the report , drawn by Ther@@ esa May in Er@@ wash@@ es , also demands the har@@ der registration checks to prevent the choice of immigration to immigration and social security .
considering the options to query elec@@ tors in front of your choice .
no removable ink on the finger one person when they had delivered their voice to prevent any one cho@@ oses twice .
systematic checks of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled to in@@ discri@@ min@@ ate .
a 3 year old limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists are able to process full post @-@ elections and envelop@@ es .
the police force the powers to set off the turn@@ around stations .
a law is a change in violation of violations of the 1983 Chamber of Justice in the People Act of 1983 ( People &apos;s Liability Act 1983 ) .
shot for@@ cements in elec@@ toral stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( excluding Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , in order to ensure that the employees are usually forced to go in the elec@@ torate alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets there was no penalty .
&quot; the elec@@ toral court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy , because of a lit@@ ur@@ gy of corrupt and illegal intern@@ ships , &quot; he said .
due to a number of reasons for suff@@ iciently - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings , he was found guilty .
he critic@@ ises the in@@ tim@@ eless &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ checks &quot; of the elec@@ tive registration departments of the Rath@@ houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court of the Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
our land contributes as the mother of the par@@ liam@@ ents a proud heir , but the concern and conce@@ aled spread of elec@@ toral fr@@ aud and void of certain authorities thre@@ aten these good reputation .

buyers in Pri@@ mark on a woman who tast@@ ed under@@ wear in the middle of the business
the buyer did not know where they were going to see when a woman moved her clothing in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try Under@@ p@@ ants .
in order to wor@@ shi@@ ped the situation , it numbered , as she looked into it , drew out and put them back into the shelf .
she left and tast@@ ed four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in Bou@@ l@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , Germany .
the Pri@@ mark business in Bou@@ l@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ p@@ ants before they put it back into the shelf
one mother of two children , J@@ enny David@@ son , who had at the same time at the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she weighed and the business went , without buying anything . &quot;
she said , &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of tro@@ users from the out@@ lay , with@@ drew its own sh@@ ru@@ ps and tro@@ users and tried them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t tried to find a somewhat discre@@ et place to do it - she was simply there , fre@@ ch like Oskar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ red , when they went out the under@@ p@@ ants , who did not like to please , since she put them into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ p@@ ants before they finally decided that she did not feel it , weighed and went down .
&quot; it seemed to not distur@@ bing that they observed any one - or about the person who would buy subscri@@ b@@ ants , who had tried them . &quot;
Mr@@ s David@@ son , 33 , lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how do you think that someone would have sub@@ du@@ ed with her home who had a different person and not yet washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
wife David@@ son added : &quot; as I have taken , the staff tries to draw up the clothes out of the sale after they walked - what exactly is good . &quot;

how to protect with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a saf@@ er saf@@ er .
we talked to Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ger in New York to find out how to go along with armed th@@ iev@@ es at hand .
regardless of whether you get from the front or behind it , this video will show how you turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ bers .
if you are att@@ aching at the rear , you should turn out as first it , so that you can see your attack@@ ers and play &quot; from the line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the gun then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat it with your free el@@ bow to your face .
beat him with the kne@@ e in the glue and turn , while the attack@@ ers joined pain together , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move , while they move the weapon to him .
with attack@@ ers , that approach itself from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the weapon and turn them away , so the attack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , put the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from his handle before moving towards back@@ ward and make the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly as it &apos;s Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that at a rob@@ ber@@ y on the saf@@ est , your money is enough - if you don &apos;t have a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ masters .
Travel@@ er Ian Wright goes out for a guide with his tongue to the dirty places in Europe
a British travel under@@ took his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex for a serious assessment - having found some of the dirty and most holy places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel or Ian Wright , 51 , out of Suff@@ olk will make its course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a washing machine of access toilet and a public telephone in Russia to provide the resistance of its immune system .
before leaving every object , it used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show and show us what he is going to be .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner &apos;s Strength , brought some surprising results on daylight .
the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ b of a access toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely shock @-@ shock , but indeed you are in a kitchen molecules more poor bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and its own health .
fortunately , he left nothing whatever he le@@ aked , more than a bad taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of its bo@@ wel , looking through the world , as well as wonderful things and marv@@ ell@@ ous things .
from public funds to train stations up to r@@ ins@@ ing cr@@ ushing of toilets , the task presented his immune system Defin@@ itely below a sample
in the film he told us : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ wor@@ ried about what my health care and I have put all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and sl@@ ud@@ ge . &quot;
in the film he was just a reputation for his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pro@@ mo paper showed a lumin@@ ometric number of more than 4000 units .
in contrast , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ri@@ gs was less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he ref@@ using to ref@@ resh their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ri@@ gs over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands had one of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright , and the Finnish producer of dairy Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial population of different places like the bathroom
in the film he says : &quot; it comes to the worst , what I did in a toilet is close . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I &apos;m not st@@ oned here , because it is in@@ car@@ ap@@ ing .
the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &apos; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company st@@ roll Mr Wright with vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us that contains both Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illi and vitamin C and D to support the support of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .
validation Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to do something new for consumers .
something that &apos;s in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing to look at and simultaneously explains the advantages of Pro@@ biotics .
we conducted mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that led to us that we said &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in the health sector is to be a global phenomenon
instead just talk about the products , we wanted to exhibit them in a larger context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information about an interesting way and provide more information about an interesting way .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direc@@ ting of the film , added : &quot; let me tell me - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tast@@ ed some of the things I have instructed him , like the most common Russian toilet , which will be shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there were things , in which it was easier to bring to Ian , to check it and others , in which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty L@@ eck@@ eries on film . &quot;
in a validation carried out by the year 2015 , 84 per cent of all respon@@ dents of Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illi are particularly associated with the wealth of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they also contain at least occasionally products which contain l@@ actic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ cial family left their social apartment after a del@@ etion of £ 50.000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ um@@ cock were thrown out of a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing cooperative had property in a ir@@ rever@@ able condition .
the walls exp@@ elled holes on wooden panels were torn , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family moved and it is believed to be living in a private accommodation now
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , which works for home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it feared that the apartment is no longer necessary .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the opinion that people don &apos;t need to live in this way .
there are many things to consider as this property will probably be viewed as a beautiful piece of Corn@@ walls .
the family is inf@@ am@@ ous and its reputation is it also .
the couple had three sons , the temporary lived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror led the family , street strug@@ gles with bas@@ eball bats , so@@ ber @-@ so@@ ber , drug tra@@ ps , drugs and exc@@ essive cry , strings and curse .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , in June an arrangement for ant@@ is@@ hi@@ es behaviour was .
in some rooms of the house , which become torn down under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
it was ra@@ zed in the estate in which the past drugs have been tra@@ ded , the wooden boards were torn
neighbours therefore said that they looked at the streets and had to be challenged by the police
in this week , Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ged her and her partner this week , after they gave them a prolonged term of 11 weeks to volunte@@ er voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ er@@ ated by ligh@@ tened neighbours , saying that their lives was made to hell .
one said , &quot; They were not ashamed . &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was bad .
the countless times we are saying the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - that &apos;s not usual !
now , where they are finally away , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had to co@@ operate the family with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years .
litter and old toys were thrown on the covered side of the Municipal House .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ants agree to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as the final step is to consider the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
that was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extremely interesting and their deeds were terrible for their neighbours .
I guess about the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church , who have cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have given us the information we have done .
I hope that this development is consol@@ ation and provides the message that the anti @-@ potential behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons were lived at different times in the house , but that they all have 20 .
there is a dirty mattress in one of the bedrooms of the house after the s@@ og@@ ation back to the floor .
workers of the house administration are now to defend the gar@@ bage trees that sur@@ round the house
in 2014 , the police introduced a raid on the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ age , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine penalty after having found guilty of the possession of a drug group B in the trade fair .
she claimed that the money was for a tomb of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came in 2013 with a car accident .
after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and their partners are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ymouth .
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .

Donald Tr@@ ump dre@@ amed &quot; tremendous problems &quot; in elec@@ toral campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries even in traditional conservative federal states their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave the weakness of his election campaign in the Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment in which the mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ ent is usually large and self @-@ adap@@ tive mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire such as concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 rival inside the republi@@ can camp , the doub@@ ts of his success in combat around the White House can grow .
&quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for assistance in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
wrong reports are false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can High@@ ly W@@ ack@@ ing W@@ ack@@ ing
Utah is normally a secure bank for Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
a survey by Surv@@ ey@@ US from June , according to Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton at the same time .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump usually , however , not with the distance that are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
as at risk , Arizona and Georgia also apply .
in an interview of the transmitter CN@@ BC Tr@@ ump into the question as he would stop the increase of Clin@@ ics again : &quot; as I made it so far . &quot;
and either back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make anything else than &quot; the truth . &quot;
if it is not rich for him on the end for reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , that is ok , Tr@@ ump said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Communist Party of Tr@@ ump must submit to support for the support of its elec@@ toral struggle , he should present no better fra@@ ct@@ ance values .
instead of its wool , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are stronger than the arms .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish community anticip@@ ates mass flight
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises the Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on the packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Presidency of the Gü@@ len approach Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish community in Germany anticip@@ ates ten thousands of protection trials which fled from Turkey to Germany in short term .
in the medium term , there could even be &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , the band leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
because of the hard @-@ term of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , the Kur@@ dish community in Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; short @-@ term , with tens of thousands of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continues to fight the min@@ orities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the Committee Chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
because the government already moved Kur@@ dish high bur@@ gs , 500,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were going to escape during the months of Kur@@ dish .
after the failed p@@ utsch was added to sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onable eth@@ n@@ ical Turks .
many will want to do re @-@ start in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that refugees live in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k .
the aid of attor@@ neys compl@@ ained the presence of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ alian cities .
to allow Erd@@ og@@ an to increase the outlet pressure on the remaining cur@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CDU member , have been cut off . &quot;
the German government provided that the federal government guarantees &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his supporters . &quot;
in Germany , a &quot; Wit@@ ch @-@ hunt &quot; was held against Erd@@ og@@ an critics .
in the last months I won &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , mostly Kur@@ ds and opposition .
the fire marking as Gü@@ len pend@@ ants destroy teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional survival .
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises the Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on the packs of caffeine , by the way also the Kem@@ p and sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len approach foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; world . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Finance , the Turks occupied the biggest group of asylum in Germany before the coup d &apos;@@ etat .
on the reporting date June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people , which was just under 29 percent of all recognized as as@@ yl@@ ated ( 3@@ 9,@@ 625 ) .

Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where there is wrong &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the nati@@ ves get nothing from the summer cho@@ ices with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers of North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in the year 2021 the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the sever@@ ity Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for it is not so far so far , it &apos;s not : summer vacation , heat and national dishes - that ends .
the loc@@ als that are to be convinced by the cho@@ ices are on vacation .
most of the tourists that are in the country are on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no loc@@ als , so you are not allowed to choose the country .
practical problems include practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers that distribute the plac@@ ards are infl@@ ated , flyer and at the end of the vote , only lab@@ elled .
until September 4th , 2016 , the election and last day of all day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern will have to pass over for a few days over the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it also goes to something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU Coalition , has to be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly visible behind the CDU .
exciting , how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D will cuts and what remains of the end end of course .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous campaign , one sees his big posters .
he travels across the land , spread ros@@ es and pl@@ au@@ ts a little with the people , as it did already be the legendary in his legendary predecessor , Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , se@@ p@@ ering has given cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gave the debt to the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D .
their refugee policy , you &quot; We are creating &quot; to accelerate the up@@ lifting of the rectangle , which is now thought to be priced .
the CDU with its peak research , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you play at the right place for elec@@ toral campaign .
she has invited twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for major agreements ; Merkel &apos;s federal state is in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Westphalia and Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; Vincent coconut , General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR .
but there is too bad nobody to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CDU have largely ren@@ ounced the usual election conditions on market conditions and in front of the shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
that , co@@ ca@@ ine , plays only a &quot; minor role . &quot;
also the Union has indicated that in the country it is the base that she must meet very much , again to find a wire to the people .
you are like the left , the SPD , the Green Party : hardly available in the circumstances of the country .
however , the Council of the CDU campaign on its Mit@@ il@@ iter is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you need to go where it does , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , any birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is on the game , S@@ ella has now called his SPD for a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , the Social Democrats recently accounted for 22 percent behind partner CDU ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD gained its shar@@ ply with 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) .
the green , small party with seven percent in surveys , can leave the jump into the day .
they make up a modern tac@@ kling from the holiday @-@ distress and place their campaign great on the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; is the president Claudia Müller .
otherwise green elec@@ tive sil@@ es rely on track searching for local stim@@ ulation among tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the hair@@ pin , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it nice too .
your impression : &quot; Intern@@ ship in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 restoration : guest plants suffer from blocking
by speed the B 27 is rehabil@@ it@@ ated , there is nothing to treat .
the construction works starting at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and until 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is al@@ loc@@ ating praise .
&quot; all have been pretty cool , &quot; tells El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet gas station .
this is a superb team .
there is no default .
the construction site was planned to be moved to the half time as scheduled to the South until the end of October all will be finished .
the unloading will also be responsible for the construction works , for example , when it comes to the facility of accommodation cru@@ ises .
since the construction site on the Monday to the south , and also the re@@ jection of the Asp@@ erg@@ street in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again relaxed , the traffic situation within the place is relaxed .
the citizens can now sail on both sides by O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen .
the expul@@ sion through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; says the general manager of the Ministry of Transport and Deputy Head of the Deputy Head of Florian King .
the local residents of Bach@@ el Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ on had to fight with more traffic noise , because many gor@@ ges had sought and rather trusted in the sign@@ age .
what led to that some people were forced to do in residential areas .
because the speed limit have not been observed , the church requested the measurement vehicle from mal@@ ign@@ ans .
&quot; there were significant exceeding , &quot; says King that made herself a location on the spot themselves .
there are already two to three per minute b@@ lown up .
the high speed was at 77 km / h in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
but since the construction site has been moved , it has become a quiet .
for business@@ men on the B 27 , it &apos;s only a small comfort that is open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg for customers .
business people do not like to see in these cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation of them has led to them in sales places , everyone , whom one asks , can look through .
however some more and some less are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum light reduction , &quot; but also one of course , &quot; it is missing . &quot;
the most well @-@ being explo@@ res are the local road along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds distinct words .
this is already exist@@ ent .
not only it , but all the cars made it &quot; hard . &quot;
it lack@@ ed the customers of h@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ a rope .
we have to be happy about every euro sales .
it aims at &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot;
the road building has been thrown by two years . &quot;
half of his employees have to let go away .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , the policy would have responded different .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt respon@@ ding to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there would be a financial balance , otherwise , the restaurant benef@@ ited from the advantages of the position on the B 27 . now they also let the dis@@ advantages that surrender to the refurb@@ ishment .
g@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where there was a bit more spacious .
G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to pass .
after all , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the history of history .
that other guests can now understand less frequently due to the complicated traffic light , but can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive it , it is very different .
that his ancest@@ or desc@@ ends back to the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the cris@@ es of BSE with BSE and birds , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the greatest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal there .
in the name of the terror control the terror attacks will be screw@@ ed into law .
according to recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick safety package .
but what has a terror status with terror ?
and what does the Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ er say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is the Re@@ conc@@ iler .
all his proposals are polit@@ ically un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the Presentation of his new security package .
they require no request .
others , further points would be discussed initially within the parties .
I also involved with me too .
but the Minister of Interior , however , is its results from him and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sens@@ us &quot; within the Coalition .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère was given a little time after the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , before he presents his conclusions for the security in the republic .
but these are all more extensive .
a lot has already been announced , announced that a new safety authority to take care of the b@@ aked communication is not new .
even the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications on flight information and arms law .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities are also not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt for suggestions that do not have been doing so far for the SPD : he wants to establish sympath@@ y for terror groups and jihadists with double citizenship about the German passport .
&quot; this will be more difficult points for the SPD , &quot; which the CDU @-@ man is a dre@@ amer .
however , he still hold it for a reasonable and challenging , even what odds calcul@@ ating in the coalition partner .
a few new ideas show@@ cases de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in itself : it is planning fast @-@ procedure for deportation orders and more possibilities for collecting people in front of deportation .
refugees who have been brought to the country are to reveal their smartphone in advance , and the social media account for a security check in advance .
with Dul@@ ce for the el@@ dest asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to have some worse than now - such such that off@@ ences go away or to throw away their pap@@ ers to swal@@ low up their identity .
a lot of them is polit@@ ically and legally marriage .
man@@ se works even un@@ balanced and leaves asking questions .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of facts , for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , say de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it &apos;s important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be expressed in the speech that the assassination of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ er@@ zburg cl@@ ans were refugees .
there are also many people in view of the high refugee &apos;s wor@@ ries about security .
and things that car@@ esses the people , let not even be cl@@ amped into elec@@ toral struggle times .
the inner security is enormous in focus .
first attack in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the backup is great .
and yes , there are cho@@ ices .
Union and SPD lead to the subject of internal security increasingly in position .
in the past days , the two parties passed away .
a gar@@ n@@ iger dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some global ministers , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs is also calling for a return of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also lab@@ ors here with conc@@ ili@@ atory notes .
from a return from the double compass , he stop nothing .
we meet the discussion in Germany .
they are re@@ marked , be not useful .
and with a bur@@ ka prohibition he had a constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own package at all corners is un@@ constitutional and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must still show itself .
there is a lot in what to fight for war .
but the SPD is also attemp@@ ting to pro@@ filing with the subject of inner safety .
partner Sig@@ mar Gabriel is sign@@ alized only to talk talk time and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that will help ensure safety . &quot;
Volkswagen still comes to Volkswagen .
in spite of diesel and@@ als , the supplier will increase worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
in case of re@@ voc@@ al action there is vor@@ tex around a concept .
Volkswagen kicks off for deliveries in the second half of 2006 .
Europe &apos;s largest high@@ ways can see further plus in the previous year despite its many brands and some well run markets .
but in July weak@@ ened the core mark VW above all in Western Europe and made it res@@ ale back the total sales , which was recorded in the D@@ ax @-@ listed company .
in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , ship@@ ments accounted for almost one hex@@ agon .
the sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July primarily on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , there are also some core markets in some core markets by changing economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU , explained a speech .
in the US , where the emission aff@@ air first es@@ cal@@ ated , also stands on a min@@ us .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the primarily affected house brand of Lower Saxony was further increased by diesel engines : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
Group sales of Fred Kap@@ pler could continue to refer to an increase in sale from January to July .
Volkswagen in this period delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software certificate .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million cars to re@@ arm@@ ament into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW showed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after the re@@ arm@@ ament of vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power was no deteri@@ oration .
the car &apos;s car is entitled to a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but he didn &apos;t talk of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in its company .
reason for legal ess@@ ments .
&quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen preserv@@ es his German clients now a guarantee for all diesel models .
this had confirmed this last Monday VW @-@ representatives at the Federal Ministry of Office .
it was confirmed by the Ministry of Health , that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has agreed to fully comply with the stipul@@ ations of my investig@@ ating commission and KBA . &quot;
&quot; der@@ og@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister of Office Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has taken the warranty that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after re@@ arm@@ ament , and all of the approved vehicle values will remain unchanged .
Volkswagen even uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not how it was in business circuits .
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; provides Volkswagen the possibility for example a half a year after conversion about with a motor damage to a workshop - and that could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do .
also in the customer &apos;s interest it is important to avoid that it occurs in et@@ ai@@ one other damage , that did not do anything with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ and@@ al , too , with regard to potential warranty claims , as it was called .
therefore , use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; to the VW &apos; guarantee .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands interest savings in the future - as second institute in Germany .
ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park the 40 million euro on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day time deposits . &quot;
the German Association of German Ban@@ ks speaks of one single incident and sees no signal : normal savings would have to be afraid to pay for their savings banks . &quot;
if banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay 0.4 per cent of pen@@ alties .
this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day deposits .
&quot; the first 100.000 Euro are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 cost will be € 400 in the year , &quot; Paul said .
it has been around 40 million euros , which could be raised from one day to the other and could not be missed .
&quot; they are lying on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent cost , &quot; said the ban@@ ker .
&quot; I can &apos;t lay up for every million . &quot;
according to the course principle , the cost will continue to continue .
cash is simply too dangerous in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four inci@@ dents , I don &apos;t even have the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
most of the clients could have their understanding and changes to other investment designs .
only a few immig@@ rants to other banks .
the Gen@@ ossen@@ federation of Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme policy course of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks . &quot;
they alone are not able to promote &quot; operating profit &quot; not possible . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .
for deposits of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Country had made head@@ lines with their ski bank branch 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , chief managing director of the banking federation , said : &quot; we do not expect to pay private customers with respect for deposits , in addition to this , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks are much too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; a client@@ ele that is slightly luxuri@@ antly furnished by the property . &quot;
&quot; that can be a small bank for a small bank , &quot; if they feed for free money .
the Gen@@ ossen@@ es@@ bank G@@ mund , established in 1911 in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ ders , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , established in 1911 .
in the region , known actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs .
at the present part , there are no further banks known to the Gen@@ ossen@@ federation of Bavaria , &quot; said spokes@@ person for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst .
by the end of June , the President of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold of the neg@@ atives to go to private clients , is very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it threatened the emig@@ ration of An@@ leg@@ ern to the competition .
customers in Germany will not have fallen in the width .
Dest@@ ination Use : who actually buys records ?
lon@@ ely men middle ages love records .
before you are talking to the comment part , in order to exc@@ ite him under the pseud@@ onym non @-@ al@@ arms defect of men with rough chances , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multiple deliver@@ ance of sound boards does not want to be welcomed to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , due to the real@@ ignment of physical objects , but on the Mid@@ life nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have bought a record recently have been fo@@ resi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
indeed , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer of the buyer .
there is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers reserve their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone for spend ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but does the results of You@@ Go@@ v do ?
if this blog would have a news report on TV would follow me , while I carry the camera in the middle of a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest grey suit , wear and wild , before I stop , keep my hands and some sort of immen@@ sely like : &quot; so let &apos;s throw us a closer look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw a look at .
even though the heart of So@@ H@@ os goes slowly over to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where you were once independent sellers - there are as a hand@@ ful of fantastic turn@@ tables .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind controlled by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , which I of S@@ ister Ray ( number of data : two young women , three men middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men middle ages , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collectors , question I ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 records .
this sound records , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed after the house ) , changing the walls of his living room .
the reason why he owns a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not aff@@ ord , when they had appeared and sold all objects when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought to buy something too young to buy it , &quot; he says .
it is true that those who buy plates , more and glad@@ ly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I smoke not and I drink not much . &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , which works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile is true .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people that have influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback to buy again their old plates .
of the discussions that I have led , people are usually de@@ pri@@ ved around 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom on supporters of the panel of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like phon@@ ica to realize that the panel stores a soo@@ thing community of equal t@@ inn@@ s .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers hit the contact with the non @-@ contact payment system .
some record fans are overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to return to the stability of confi@@ denti@@ als , from objects , che@@ er@@ ful events .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or the ownership of material poss@@ essions than a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
that &apos;s in me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people so .
it &apos;s a simple way to employ spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; sol@@ dered a staff from a record stack .
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people have bought a record , they did not yet have heard .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player that they never use it , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , have no turn@@ tables .
at that point of the message I would probably look very concerned , while I bl@@ amed through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova com@@ pil@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who has been working at sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three men middle age ) has noticed a &quot; t@@ rophy &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone recently returned here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Schall@@ platte , so I would like to put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage but it happens definitely .
more productive @-@ consuming , less musi@@ cl@@ astic .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , which are only slowly .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor , has an b@@ lower audience when I walk .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists that make photos , teenagers and women average age .
even if the atmosphere is slightly relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest Syn@@ thesis and Expert Pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ens from the speakers - is it good to see such diversity in the customer .
no one of them se@@ eth lon@@ ely , but n@@ ag@@ ious psych@@ mat@@ a are hard to be fixed when you stand apart from someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running on business for a few minutes and considers the variation of the disks available for sale .
it looks more like a sh@@ ov@@ em@@ mel as a large one .
she deserv@@ es not much , therefore the collecting of records is not a real option , says it .
it cost much .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in other way to hear , but the beauty of sl@@ abs is ... &quot; they drives with a pleasant sig@@ h .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a business which is said that a new generation of record lovers will have to be inspired by Urban Out@@ j@@ ams .
while I give the ticket to samples the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants , I watch one group of young teenagers who occupy a group of Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and daughter is superior to buy a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics which is essential for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to handle it .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items would like to mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about itself .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like records .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree that the Great number of female collectors in S@@ oh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and turn@@ tables exist in reality , top shops and online tours are in@@ adequate .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not st@@ rolling through Pl@@ um@@ bles by record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through Pl@@ ain , while holding the star@@ ving look of an un@@ fur@@ ious , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false talent , which rises nothing of elderly men aged over the shoul@@ ders .

French court re@@ jects request for demol@@ ition of shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
French court rejected an offer by authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live , settled in thousands of refugees .
in case of a court hearing this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should have jurisdiction to rip 72 Provis@@ ional Business , in which persons sell goods or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy would be paid out of which no tax would be paid and those of fire and san@@ ction cru@@ ises .
in humanitarian groups , with the court found that the business and restaurants are important , as the free meals that were offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , not sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that the Provis@@ ional Business and restaurants often offered accommodations and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate 72 Provis@@ ional Business , but dre@@ amed that the concerns of Cal@@ ais &quot; pre@@ fecture are absolutely track@@ able . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role , live as people who live in extremely boun@@ ties . &quot;
he said that the areas have tran@@ qui@@ l meeting between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Camp , which is a non @-@ profit @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as an advice about asylum procedures for hundreds of protection requirements , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos;s café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was stated that the closure &quot; was charged for this children of a cat@@ astrophe , of which the youngest is eight years old . &quot;
the two charity organization Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge of the Mig@@ rants has estimated that the number of people in the jung@@ le @-@ camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after an steep rise of new@@ com@@ ers during the summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be set to the next generation speed sensor . in different states , amongst others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested to effectively trans@@ forming the template .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic company in Wiesbaden can be used for example in accidents where the police would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement .
for example , on highway building or to rehabil@@ it@@ ating bridges , there are often no necessary infra@@ structures to ensure compliance with a stationary point for adher@@ ence to speed limit .
a more durable construction can be too dangerous or elabor@@ ately .
the En@@ forcement trailer is autonomous : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measuring operation , which will be encrypted using a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously via several tracks .
variable speed limit as well as passage from time , riding and vehicle class can also be monitored .
the trailer is able to move up the trailer with a trailer hit@@ ch to the manufacturer , according to manufacturer .
that it wasn &apos;t easy to clear , it is lowered into the measuring operation , so the wheels in the pan@@ ni@@ es and by the way also dis@@ appears out of un@@ certain outside cover .
furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information by Vit@@ ronic in various German states and is now also used .
in addition , foreign authorities , with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive great Britain in the 7 @-@ seater Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening on an ab@@ rupt stop at the last hur@@ dle , when they were defeated with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in De@@ od@@ oro Stadium here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side qu@@ ping , reverse circulation , liner running and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic Games in any color .
the defeat was sunk by the not too bad tro@@ st@@ ine of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth in that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day might fall back in the finals .
however , in this form , Fi@@ ji had@@ n &apos;t put a 15 @-@ man team in the form .
it might be a comfort for GB - but it probably will probably be - that at least a Br@@ ite will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former chef for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult road behind .
eight years ago she lost under Ry@@ an every game on Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
they lost only one .
this sli@@ pping will p@@ act , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji also wonder@@ fully and caused the attacks of GB@@ S from hat@@ red .
it felt at captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co . an , when you were running in driving buses . the World Series winner went up 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au spent in the corner .
at still four minutes of play Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i left another attack from the right corner , which he walked .
there are 12 @-@ 0 and GB hard to get the ball .
a strong T@@ ack@@ le of Mitch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a had a touch down and there stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new year since the resum@@ ption of the N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa , and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou are pre@@ f@@ ake by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion had a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is such that Fi@@ ji were born to have been born to play 7 , while UK still re@@ mit .
this is how it is .
GB led fundamental changes to the half time through and completed the fi@@ ji@@ ag@@ ic gap ... for a full four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half time , to Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through a Br@@ illi@@ ant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favour of the south exposure , the fans bends , and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not hard to admire the Polish approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ t@@ ittle with another attempt in the last seconds .
the p@@ fi@@ ff @-@ rays , the Fi@@ j@@ is em@@ bra@@ ced , and the GB were ex@@ hor@@ ted to the lawn .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan &apos;s semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK pushed South Africa into a cris@@ p match from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ k in the first half of the front , but Dan Norton took the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate under the position in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the British 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the cancer of train@@ ers to rowing victory
there will be no emotional gold as with these games and that wants what will be called .
from the first stop until the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , that enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment on Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting on the harbour , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams was always present at the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , which laid such a scale .
their Domin@@ ance was absolutely , all of her 3@@ 9,@@ th un@@ le@@ aking use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Athlet@@ es , that slides over the surface with elegance of sw@@ ings , which is not reflected in the way of the Tri@@ umph@@ al Ar@@ ch .
behind every gold in ruins , a Bat@@ ail@@ lon is helping to contribute to the incre@@ mental progress , which make the difference , and there was no more hil@@ ly than the coach who would not survive one day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer at all .
as he said he ris@@ eth what ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , who is oper@@ able and doing it .
if you do not do it , he spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the Trio was fortun@@ ate that he could be the treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could begin the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if this is the correct term under such circumstances .
I needed money , therefore I had to go better again soon .
it was a incenti@@ ve .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it starts .
the rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it even greater .
in the in@@ fertil@@ ity of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who had a nerv@@ ous morning , thus spent a little bit more than anything else to handle its own fears .
w@@ anning , the cent@@ ur@@ ion at the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means as much . &quot;
it is repeated just how much as I and Helen and I have also been working at this time .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would not have a massive thanks to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I would not have any better person for train@@ ers or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even during the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to susp@@ end , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it is really important to take a tear off .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something t@@ oll@@ es .
today we wanted no fire@@ works , we wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take a break off for a year before making decisions concerning the future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now they just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years in exempl@@ ary for clarity ;
the Managing Director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ ful group &quot; group , R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian broad@@ ly exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small fresh drinking water assembly as model for the large water producers .
so there was some time ago in a post @-@ old origin@@ ator in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken was accused of the purposes of the purposes .
the work of the eit@@ ful group is &quot; Bavarian broad@@ ly &quot; as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who had a permanent staff of 31 years , had been as managing director for 31 years .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water association of the operating group with headquarters in K@@ otten@@ dorf , Municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with about 5500 inhabitants .
affili@@ ates are the churches of Kirch@@ loud , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for further towns and communities , there are water supply agreements .
the current chairman Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set in 1985 as a wat@@ cher , and was named as Managing Director of the Zwe@@ ck@@ federation in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks are very mani@@ fold and they extended from waste management and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational activities , the budget of preparation , lim@@ estone of charges and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ woman .
as an exceptional events called it the commissioning and inauguration of the new well ( 1994 ) , property sales in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ development of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) , and the re@@ organisation of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) .
I have given no nurs@@ ing , and I have always taken new features , because Water lives and pot@@ able water is the most important food .
in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o they praised G@@ ö@@ ll@@ s , reliable and correct service over the 31 years .
he has been used with plenty of heart blood for its purpose @-@ purpose and has lived on a wat@@ cher , as if it had his own company .
a few weeks ago , he had to present the success concept of the leadership group for Nit@@ rates before the water forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken &apos;s water forum .
he has received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller also praised the wat@@ cher , Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together for 28 years .
he is the best s@@ wart for water and he was a faithful man .
together we were a unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his view , he called the fountain construction and the re@@ structured of the two .
however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult use was at the elevation of the church at Kirch@@ loud on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , that the settlements have to be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be reck@@ oned once , because one filled the reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with a hoses .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel Mo@@ mer out of Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

when the disease had been known with her son , she believed that she had to die .
but the eight year old ti@@ ago has come up well forward and learn private in New York where it &apos;s the best therap@@ ist .

steel - light orientation for German steel industry
the ger@@ ris@@ ons and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in a size of millions .
financial burden that threatened the industry from the green electricity funding , are at the table .
it was staying with the liberation of the Renewable Energi@@ es in the German steel industry in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister for Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , the West German general newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; I am really happy that we could finally tell the negotiations after two years . &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission originally planned to use steel manufacturers to use the gases from the high temperature for electricity generation for their own demand .
according to the German industry sector , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a certificate with the European Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators in steel buildings are replaced , which accounts for an EEG real@@ location of 20 percent .
but these will not be imposed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the European Commission &apos;s agreement with the EU @-@ European Commission .
this makes the status Quo written in the previous rule .
special meaning have been the successful pain@@ low of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel the future &apos; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; more need to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suff@@ ers since the financial crisis of 2008 under over@@ capacity and a considerable price @-@ pressure .
last year , the situation further expanded , when the world &apos;s largest producer in China saw the global market for growing demand in view to the global market .
European manufacturer t@@ oss Chinese steel con@@ fin@@ es price d@@ umping .
during this spring the situation was relaxed .
for an overview , import duties based on imported steel impact , the other economic prospects take place in China .
it is un@@ clear how sustain@@ ably the price recovery is .
on Thursday , the German industry prim@@ us Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp remains carefully on Thursday .
last@@ ly , prices are more stag@@ n@@ ated .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
at the end of 2015 Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp created not the closing of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July the German steel producer remained careful despite ascending prices and increasing orders .
they produced a good six percent less cru@@ de steel , six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year , as well as the Economic Association of Steel .
after a short increase in May the produced amount now returned to the second month .

community , Spirit , health : singing does senior citizen
she has accompanied her whole life : as a young woman she was in the school of school , she finished the subject of music , and today she sings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a Sen@@ iors Choir .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physical , &quot; describes it .
after a sample she feels balanced , che@@ er@@ ful and a total of life , she says .
at the same time , they do something good in their health and spirit .
because S@@ ingen is like a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler , from the German senior league .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the pleasure in music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through the regular mer@@ it , Sen@@ iors may establish social contacts and maintain .
for frequently , social and family structures appear at the age , a ch@@ orus is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made known Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her ch@@ orus : &quot; to talk and organize on the other , to learn and learn one another - a choir is a very special form of compositions . &quot;
sing in the positive sense in the positive sense , believes H@@ ac@@ kler .
since there is a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly calls his lungs are not so fast in the daily life .
even though it comes to get the sound of the sound of age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on older people , singing is often a very special effect , says Urs@@ ula L@@ enz from the Federal Employment Community of the Sen@@ iors organizations .
in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school as well as in leisure , explains them .
L@@ enz observed that singing or listening of songs in elderly people will wake many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , people suffer from himself to leng@@ thy events .
in addition to the S@@ ingen , the head will also be charged a special performance .
at the same time , at the same time , focusing on his own voice and adapt to the other sl@@ ings - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not just prac@@ tise yourself on itself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that you de@@ parts by singing in the choir , believes H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusi@@ astic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em is growing by singing in the choir .
themselves to show yourself : if I &apos;m long for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to begin with S@@ ingen , so there &apos;s enough .
anyone w@@ ishing to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he believes , little talent will have .
we will not be singing only - with 50 singing people , who list@@ ens to me when times a tone goes to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , seniors offers different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
anyone sings from the acquain@@ t@@ ance circle in a Senior Mer@@ ch@@ ic@@ or , you can simply connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the surroundings .
who wants to sing in a church choir can turn right to the congregation or church of the church .
many senior intelligence companies can also be found on the internet .
whoever does not have access to internet , you can request the family , friends or neigh@@ bor .
the desire to sing , shou@@ ting to be sure to join a choir , be@@ at@@ t H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing the soul well and has something of the liberation - this is true for every age .
cats react sensiti@@ vely than a cr@@ ater to the k@@ ittens of the young
bi@@ ologists studied in Hanover , which effect the herds of cat@@ chers from adult bab@@ ys has grown up on adult animals .
in her surprise the Mi@@ racle did not leave the male no cold - however , they still kept the difference to the females always .
female cats may recognize the exc@@ ite degree of cat@@ ch@@ bab@@ ys at the Mi@@ racle of the Small Gallery .
they react to ten percent faster on the bi@@ b of bi@@ b found in great trou@@ bles as scientists have found out of the physician &apos;s physician and the Medical University Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react to the ru@@ bs of k@@ ittens - however always the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently the acoustic differences between the ten@@ ants of less and strongly en@@ ligh@@ ten vir@@ ility for the male are either non @-@ perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding spoke of the MH@@ H .
it is the first auth@@ ori@@ ent study that was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ ct@@ Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of k@@ ittens with the ur@@ gency of their help are distinguished .
a total of nine adult males and eight cad@@ ences were observed from the zoo of the MH@@ H .
to them they were played for a little of little ones , taken for three minutes from the root box and were separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were con@@ fron@@ ted with cry of stronger k@@ ittens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers hold their results in spite of the small sample for sa@@ w@@ ed strong .
&quot; all the females , even those who had no own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding .
they turned faster to loud speaker , when this ra@@ ce@@ de played the very rainy k@@ ittens .
this ability may be born or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past scientists have already examined several times the reactions of women and men on baby eleph@@ ants .
also , some studies show that women are sensitive to inf@@ am@@ inate , whether they were already mothers &apos; or not , the Bi@@ ologist of Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported themselves .
Po@@ dol@@ ski g@@ athers with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ ar has a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant was issued in Turkey against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ or .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
another important soccer game takes place in Turkey for the first time in Turkey .
before Du@@ el of the Arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul in Istanbul about the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
already with the suspension of the withdraw@@ als after the crash test in July , the government , the daily life of normal citizens should not be imp@@ aired .
however , this does not apply to those who have suspected the movement of the pre@@ dig@@ er Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len to be responsible for the coup attempt .
also before the football is not made .
the Prosecutor filed an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ ar .
accordingly , in the meantime the Southern France living room has been accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
the Sü@@ ver must be followers of the Secretary Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len to be responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an .
although the initial status is valid for 90 days , the exceptional status is still valid till October , actually the life of most Turks has so good as no consequences .
the n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; democracy @-@ gu@@ ards &quot; on public places throughout the country has been declared throughout the country on Wednesday for its end .
sports is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of the earth .
especially fans of the Workers Club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as are traditionally not counted to the friends of president .
but what the Turks occupied the Turks in view of dramatic experiences in history is the strict re@@ jection of military coup .
as even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats at Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
at the poker winner &quot; Gala , &quot; it is going to arrive in Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
its sporty value demonstrated in the past season under proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 @-@ winner .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atic &quot; celebrated it : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished his season to a perfect way and secured the Cup in his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season was a reconc@@ iled season for the record master .
after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; had to say too early in the League .
in the South by Li@@ g there was only rank six .
the season was not good .
the poker player was the only possibility to win anything .
&quot; that &apos;s made it , and this is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as ran the game year better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who participated with 26 season of season as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ protective j@@ ump@@ y , based on the 14th title .
this is the reason that the fans continued to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the same time , the AC Florence , under the Treaty and Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , had announced just off the coup attempt to return for the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .
&quot; if Mario has to come to us , he must say it merely , &quot; he cited the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; club chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
in this way , the stor@@ ms would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce to around one @-@ third of its equivalent to 7.5 million euros . Or@@ man clear : &quot; his salary in Florence is not able to pay . &quot;

in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , at the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal employees .
according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et , the spr@@ int had gone into the air in front of the Re@@ four of the coastal police in the air .
finally , Det@@ on@@ ations needed in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ phe on the south @-@ eastern coast of several injured .
it is from a link with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , whose name was called Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said army staff Dan@@ ai crit@@ erion in Friday early on Friday .
&quot; we &apos;re assum@@ ing that it is a coordinated attack . &quot;
it is too early to express yourself to sor@@ ts - probably do the acts of Muslim reb@@ els .
in the attacks of the attacks , Thai media would have to recognize that , for the bomb det@@ ach@@ ate mus@@ li@@ stic separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the other hand , the Thai police declared , the terrorist attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ rection , or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said one spokes@@ man in Bangkok .
rather , it is possible that the bombs of the dominant military j@@ unta have been laid .
in the past few days , authorities have been informed of the standing attacks in the south of the country - however , they have been informed of the exact time and the places .
yet it is un@@ clear that the group behind the attacks .
the police reported to strengthen its officials throughout the country , security and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement district .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they often judge not against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the near@@ ing nuclear explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , recommends the instructions of the Thai security authorities to be regarded as a result .
high level of security ( security level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ cl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ a@@ and surrounding area .
according to disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , do not use necessary journeys in these provinces .
highest level of safety ( level 2 ) goes to the rest of the country .
a few days later , the attacks on Thursday and Friday carried out a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on a military j@@ unta led by the military j@@ unta .
this was a large impact on the military , even in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs were an attempt to grant chaos during the country towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody uph@@ e@@ aval , beha@@ ves themselves to have returned the kingdom again to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the military in the outer South of the country for years in the utter@@ most parts of the country .
more than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago , in Bangkok at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ wal@@ let , 20 people were killed - most of them are foreign tourists .
it was the most bloody stop of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; Ident@@ ities Movement &quot; is recommended into the vis@@ or of the Federal Office of constitutional protection .
after several families , the constitutional provisions in the covenant were set up under observation .
&quot; we see in the &apos; identity of the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; movement for asp@@ ir@@ ations against the freedom of freedom &quot; , &quot; said Constitutional Chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate at the German Press Agency in Berlin .
thus , the immig@@ rants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East will be diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways .
therefore we observe the movement now .
the &quot; Ident@@ ities Movement &quot; is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
she turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of its own identity . &quot;
constitutional in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; already .
Ma@@ arten , his authority agree to the decision to go closely with the country &apos;s decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Staff .
in general , extrem@@ ists try to arrange them with adol@@ escent language , often with p@@ opp@@ enish music .
the Cri@@ me Islam@@ ists as right as right trem@@ bling .
that is no commercial advertis@@ ements for their own thing .
prop@@ aganda must address the people .
young people are due in a special way .
that is dangerous .
in the last several states there were reports about contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ ities &quot; to Af@@ D policies .
Ma@@ aß said , I have no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species can only be relevant from a certain point .
it comes to whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people that are extrem@@ ist , changes their target direction and so severe is .
the decisive factor is that such persons contributed to the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with views of the mark@@ edly increase of rights @-@ driven offen@@ ders and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee quot@@ ations , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new rights in this context .
but we &apos;ve found in the past few years that it can be just@@ i@@ fi@@ able structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may be possible that a further just@@ i@@ fi@@ ve@@ al groups or small groups that compos@@ es the attacks against as@@ yl@@ seek@@ ers , against refugee sh@@ ei@@ me or attacks from other rights activists .
but they are no longer recogni@@ z@@ able in Germany and in Europe .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed that many inter@@ g@@ ings came to the account of people who did not occur in the fore@@ ground before .
this is all wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ ects on attacks on As@@ ylum were not known as crime , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated offen@@ ders or tra@@ ilers of the right scene .
so , &quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , who had nothing polit@@ ically in@@ different in previously , or for example CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who then had to have been radic@@ alised . however , for example , the CDU , SPD or Left Opposition had to be radic@@ alised . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te will become the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ oni@@ ans or world records at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bra@@ ve appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te in the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly over@@ sized s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia as slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was then promoted to the vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a return of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 seats .
but it was not the very sporty figure that attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
C@@ Ethiop@@ ian was awarded a special start@@ up from the international floating association .
this is distributed to make swimming in different countries .
since in Ethiopia the most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media mentioned him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
based on a &quot; Well @-@ ten@@ sion@@ er , &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ blatt &quot; The Sun &quot; was fun with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; about him .
his time , he defeated just a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters post@@ age , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
the run of the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney took the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Et@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of Freestyle .
fr@@ en@@ et@@ ically was fired at Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old took her first eight months before the Olympics and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

the fees per cubic metre of waste will be from 1 October 2016 for the area of san@@ itation of Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare € 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ te berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the A@@ zo@@ endorf press the waste water fee will be increased later again , if corresponding upgrade measures are necessary .
according to a relevant calculation , the se@@ wage rate in Az@@ endorf lies at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rat and Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these waste water discover@@ ies are underway .
the market of Kas@@ endorf is oblig@@ ated to power the facilities on its basis due to the right foundation .
from October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as industrial enterprises and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ ves , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ te berg have to look down deeper into the pur@@ se .
the firm increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
like administration of Herbert Schmidt on the board , a new calendar was necessary for san@@ itation of the market community .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there will also be overweight or sub@@ discover@@ ies of the previous year period .
the engraved edge increases , Schmidt thus compl@@ aining that there are relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wer@@ age , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters a year .
as a result , due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenditure for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be serious .
Moreover , the se@@ wage is slightly down in all three plants .
continue in the past calendar period for all three plants not least due to their age san@@ itation and repair expenses in a significant extent .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ ves , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp for almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the A@@ endorf san@@ itation plant , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ fare , the almost 20 year old conveyor systems had to be out@@ dated and at the pond fish plant L@@ opp had to be dispos@@ ed of almost 20 years of operation , the se@@ wage sl@@ ud@@ ge dispos@@ ed and provides an additional ventilation option to comply with the water regulations in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; in these extraordinary expenses , the mandatory coun@@ sel@@ or and maintenance costs , which are considered to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which were even significantly lower than the present level during the preceding financial results in 2011 / 2012 .
stone cottages made clear that despite the low se@@ wage di@@ arr@@ he@@ a in the three plants cle@@ aring the costs for the operation and maintenance &quot; full . &quot;
according to the publication , Schmidt was the market leader of great entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plants over the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will continue to continue in the opinion of Stein@@ häuser , in order to extend the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al area to extend these plants because it concerns itself of de@@ centr@@ alized facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; Effect as Asian cartoon critic@@ ised
Snap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel against races .
with its filter tool , it enables to modify the Snap@@ chat around 150 million daily users to modify the reality and to play with ident@@ ities as such a way that already sur@@ ges the ab@@ sur@@ d .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be taken from a Roy Licht@@ enstein , painting .
the filters are indisp@@ ens@@ able , in@@ exist@@ ent tools , which generate more than 30 million sel@@ f@@ ender per day .
all mis@@ tr@@ ination will arrive to the public .
the Snap@@ chat filter have withdrawn in the past cr@@ iti@@ que in which they were accused of having inter@@ act the app Black@@ face bum@@ ps or white skin as a beauty deal .
when this week some users struck a filter with a filter which gave them sl@@ ums , false teeth , and in@@ put@@ ty p@@ liers , there were some critics known as a ra@@ cial car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ds . &quot;
they asked if these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y was found on a larger problem that the company has vers@@ eness with diversity .
the news and the indig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Motherboard , one day after Snap@@ chat review that it would have been disabled .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was thought to be a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ casts that have experienced rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us , remin@@ is@@ cent of the filters of Viol@@ ating Kl@@ isch@@ ot .
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student of art , whose photos were widespread far beyond the photos that the filter &quot; Viol@@ ent and Be@@ inde were said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also added that &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ gue with the counter@@ part of a highly controversi@@ al Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not as@@ certain@@ ed , but that the yel@@ lowing of the yellow pattern was pulled down .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company to cross this cultural state .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ ation and integration of integrity , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we keep all in your hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are in the race of different than their older opponents - could rather expect to expect Sen@@ si@@ vity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture that is impossible for a user , &quot; so it is much more difficult to remain , when it was previously the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Zh@@ u decided to work as a product manager and engineering for media , her Snap@@ chat account instantly called others to do it .
in a set for medium and in a telephone interview it said that she believe that street @-@ specific contro@@ vers@@ y refle@@ cting a lack of di@@ vers@@ ities in the adjusting spra@@ ins of Snap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critic@@ ized the major part white , only male leadership , and finished it with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either I have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can meet such decisions , &quot; said the chin@@ ese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they are working with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions to tell what to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that was largely un@@ answered by the Snap@@ chat .
the company has published no figures for the diversity of its workforce , and refers to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it was possible to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently challenged a personnel responsible for focusing on population groups and on internal integration groups .
Zh@@ u said that she is closed to her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask myself if they need more user like us to tell whether that isn &apos;t O.@@ K. &quot; .
military leadership , IS@@ IS secret service information , represents Committee of Congress
military members of the United States Central Command changed dramatically further information to define a more optim@@ istic picture of war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it had allowed the actual states on site in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces , Committee of Com@@ mittees and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ h , reported by a great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Intelligence Command and reported to change their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ enc@@ om , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news service information , which typically have been reviewed by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , ass@@ aul@@ ted a picture by the American efforts towards terrorism than it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analysis of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article published .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is in@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; he introduced Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the Cent@@ Com government errors range from the top of the organization until the top of the organization .
the 10 @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct indications that government points have given orders to change reports , it shows how an@@ alysts were exposed to the pressure from their pre@@ laws , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Releases , comments and statements made clearly positive before the Congress , &quot; presented the report . &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com ruled that a military re@@ conquest of the Mos@@ sul@@ try could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , continues under control of Islamic State .
&quot; after the months of investigations , it is so far &quot; clear . &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can Congress held from Kansas , discussed in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the tips of Central Command sum@@ med up the follow @-@ up reports to play the danger through IS@@ IS in Iraq .
Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force on Life after giving them that an@@ alysts were wor@@ ried about the man@@ ipulation of reports to Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , during the investigations .
additional investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are in addition to the General Insp@@ ector of the Ministry of Defence in G@@ ange .
on Thursday , the members of the news service Committee published on Thursday their own findings , with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com formed an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of subsequent service ass@@ ess@@ ments to I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi Security Service , &quot; which was a member of the Representative House Adam B. Ship , known in a statement .
this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of recent reports , &quot; the Mor@@ al under An@@ alysts and , &quot; there was a little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. ship and Democrats stated to have found no evidence on a ri@@ pen@@ ing of the White House at Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts at a &quot; particular political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress was published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times of investigations reported by the Pentagon &apos;s general spect@@ acle , which were recorded according to Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press secretary of the Pentagon , was in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would report no reports of the Congress during the investigation of the General In@@ spect@@ acle .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have recognised opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversi@@ al discussion of this important topics of the national defence . &quot;
the investigations having regard to the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that has been made by increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year , however , the question dropped to the extent , President Obama can rely on Central Command for military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the path@@ ological data is remin@@ is@@ cent of more than ten years ago as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a font on the recommendations of many an@@ alysts , only a small occupying troops in Iraq looked after the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker on government agencies that met contrary to government proposals against the financial situation of the terrorist group as they had taken into operation in order to sell the oil on the black market .
but this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ ding Commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the elections for his exc@@ essive positive evaluation of the war situation before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with Britain .
one day after it had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two doors to the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were actually a memor@@ able performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said it could not remember to remind you that ever did .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not part of the people who keep their doors in memory .
however , it doesn &apos;t know : the Americans are 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and are at the same place with the British in the first place , which remains un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will hit the first round of the first round on Saturday .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which will gain the first and second place within their group from six teams .
the first @-@ placed team will move a little longer from the path , which will lead the other Group more .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising tur@@ bel in four years after they landed in the last London Games over the past 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey team in hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport in the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the 2008 Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because they couldn &apos;t qualify for the loader .
then , in 2012 , the year 2012 was going to shoot everything to her and team .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn the things to better .
&quot; a change of culture , mental change , and physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the work sp@@ ens@@ ing in London that we have now .
we can completely tear it completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the cake bat@@ ches on the first half of the game with a return ticket from the close range .
India was without victory in the tournament , but the team was sur@@ pris@@ ingly tough and kept the game level from 1 @-@ 0 through to the third quarter , until B@@ am the game into their hands .
it performed a spr@@ int with the sh@@ allow ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the ball in the middle and l@@ up@@ beat the ball to the US a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez opened the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the Tor@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a goal in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well it will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday .
am@@ id@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , even as late it is , the Olympic Games are too late .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly growing and unusual , a ro@@ aring seasons between competition and stre@@ aks .
it is , when the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which will protect from the wrist@@ watches to swim to the race for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t listen to the tv , read a newspaper or listen to the qu@@ eu@@ e in the Coff@@ es@@ hop , without inform@@ ing Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Dis@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of 10 with dimples , could have been completely sent among these known names , which would be sent to Prime Time , including sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV advertising , when he had a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner , or even f@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , out of Lake Forest , California , fighting for gold in the Olympic Gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event like this .
further from the center , partly in the shade there are the sports , which are not generally accepted : air@@ pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always swim the breast and get it long .
but when I do like a modest arguments for my particular favourite , then let me get the attention on the discre@@ et charm of the tr@@ amp .
although the tr@@ ol@@ ini ski@@ p already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so anno@@ ying that many people I asked , did not know that it is at all an Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art .
that could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ ms .
even though the USA sent athletes competing for competition , it has never won a medal in tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had a athl@@ ete up until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Rus@@ sians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who divide the women for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year .
the tr@@ ol@@ ini ski@@ p has a certain exterior , partly because it sounds for the un@@ explained ears for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as those sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a fe@@ asting enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the sweet trem@@ bling of its never s@@ wollen eyel@@ ids - but also the Gra@@ zie of the Turn@@ ens and Di@@ ves , the two sports , which are essentially uni@@ fies .
the word &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means a lot of &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
emerging vic@@ t@@ ins jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet across the air and need to land a number of attack@@ ing mot@@ ions ( turning , h@@ real and Sal@@ tos ) before they reach the feet .
according to the official Olympics , you will be evaluated according to the official programme of difficulty , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ man @-@ standing athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women are coming to compete in Rio .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their stre@@ aks to Gold , faster , upward , and go back , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and down , and down on the playground .
they ch@@ ase not only the finish line or the output wall , but in the TV broadcast another goal : the world or the Olympic record .
the goal oriented approach is Nobel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic , and it &apos;s enough to stir up an audience to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I have to look at this games as a bit tired .
the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the v@@ ector of the ol@@ ol@@ ini head is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she pre@@ pped , seem@@ ing heavily mis@@ sil@@ os like a ast@@ ron@@ aut , then immediately after , then effortlessly back up .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dreams of time and gravity .
it is as Zen can only be the competition during the Olympic Games .
the qualifying and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon , in the Streaming at 1.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will decor@@ ate the En@@ dr@@ o as part of an afternoon blocks on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who will probably over@@ look in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase was only achieved by the attack@@ ing and the obj@@ ection of male athletes , as it recently proposed the male US Turner at the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan community .
&quot; a generation protest@@ ers &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the United States
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators that demand political changes in Ethiopia are strug@@ gled for violent resistance to the government .
witnesses say that however di@@ vor@@ ced during cl@@ ashes with the police have been killed in Sch@@ uss@@ ers .
is Ethiopia straight going wrong ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid line of West Africa with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months , protests against the government were the country and far@@ ed in more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and desired fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s answer was un@@ comp@@ uted according to human rights organisations .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen killing them killed and killed protest@@ ers .
in circulation , facts about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security professionals beat young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a han@@ di@@ ct against a wall .
the chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now demands a further investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated from the West .
American military and secret services collabor@@ ate closely with the C@@ ans to fight terror in the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded in a considerable temp@@ o .
his infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new item in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to implement the op@@ pression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dis@@ sidents were effective in silence .
many were sent into exile or to the prison , or abor@@ ted in the wake of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you press people and these have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in central Ethiopia .
the whole youth protest@@ ers .
a generation protest@@ ers .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use up to the saus@@ age in relation to power of the rainy coalition .
after a recent elections last year , the Governing party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time st@@ resses along the border with Erit@@ rea ; a battle for these z@@ ag , controversi@@ al line called hundreds of lives in June .
analy@@ st fears that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were forced to take more or less , the tur@@ bul@@ ence , and could be armed .
several factors explain why feelings of pro@@ vocation after years in the surface becomes explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have more frequent and improved the Internet services .
even if the government turns access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , so many people still communicate over internet Pro@@ x@@ ies that conce@@ al where they are going to stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians said that they gathered themselves together to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since they prosp@@ ered , Am@@ har@@ as , who come from branches of predominantly Christian up@@ side , in politics and economy , while they took from the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in flat areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are going to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests found in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray that account for around 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , in the services , trade and politics .
the third reason to rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ ad@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ public disease in 2012 , 17 years from Ethiopia , Prime Minister .
he was considered tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
an@@ alysts predi@@ ct that he was particularly compens@@ ated in , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special issues to edit opponent and to make them dam@@ aging .
&quot; the current regime is missing on this fundamental in the D@@ ick , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , an conflict analy@@ st .
C@@ ush , a new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
in other words , Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the tiger in northern Ethiopia , comes Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the south .
analy@@ st say that he did not enjoy the trust of the security services rendered by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more bloo@@ d@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had an in@@ u@@ pro@@ ar in Ethiopia in 2005 , after thousands against elections were apparently carried out by the government themselves and then were stolen from the government .
during the following Raz@@ ci@@ ds many protest@@ ers have been killed , even if it were less than in the last months and this time of the distur@@ ban@@ ces went relatively rapidly .
development experts , C@@ ush leader for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ ship , as well as for its meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty .
but obviously , this does not have the intensi@@ fication of internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous eth@@ n@@ ical shape .
the last month di@@ vor@@ ced in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an town , used by Tig@@ ray , and the hat@@ red on the tiger is always common in the social media .
analy@@ st say that protests are the United States and other Western allies in an independent position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if they were recently closed that she has closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy over the West , he will not want to stri@@ ve together with the se@@ at@@ ile area in a already vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; this , &quot; said &quot; Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin hike . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains the Obama &apos;s claim to IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y that his campaign being surrounded by his efforts , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terror group Islamic State , not serious .
these clari@@ fication designed new questions on communication skills in the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans whether he is able to communicate clear and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his Mit@@ il@@ iter that ende@@ av@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to declare in the gra@@ de@@ cent position , which he could not be meant .
after he made the clari@@ fication at a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump rendered a statement regarding the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he did not int@@ end to recru@@ it the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he is simple , neu@@ tered .
in contrast to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said to a number of interviews , he said that the exc@@ uses spake completely to me .
when the conservative radio pres@@ enter Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to qu@@ int@@ end the statement something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , wanted to know the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate .
the last storm of cr@@ iti@@ que on Mr. Tr@@ ump is down , while he tries to get the focus of its campaign because of exp@@ ir@@ ation results in the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return this topic .
via Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ics would lead to higher taxes and found trying to bor@@ ing its speech .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July , he moved to himself strong cr@@ iti@@ que when he said that Rus@@ sians should give Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later , &quot; Of course I thought that &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the spe@@ ech@@ es limits to post@@ p@@ one and then to ru@@ des as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how to get certain messages from his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; says Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication lab which the language of both candidates were observed .
but I also believe he is cle@@ ver enough to keep his statements enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of deci@@ ding the sound for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has taken a closer sound , since its poll@@ s have passed further .
a new pol@@ l of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a large margin in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ al statements , he charged his critics frequently to susp@@ icious his statements or unt@@ rue .
but while he intensi@@ fied in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze chose his lo@@ yal co @-@ stri@@ pe in the un@@ comfortable situation to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York , and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps , prominent inter@@ c@@ ession , continued to defend the candidates today in an CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I think what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani said it to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had formed the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that Obama called IS@@ IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ ben@@ chers , entirely wrong and so it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most of the ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argu@@ ing that the government served as an external Minister , it allowed IS@@ IS to spread themselves to expand the situation in the Middle East to control .
prior to the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and did over@@ threw himself , on each of his words , and pre@@ occupied with him .
he stran@@ ded the &quot; poor , &quot; e@@ un@@ ful &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; They don &apos;t know ! &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use as merely a further evidence that he is un@@ fit for the presidential address .
once ou@@ sted about the award from the market , the Café in Green@@ point goes back
the Cafe was a p@@ ale café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which was no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue are displac@@ ed .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which de@@ buted in the summer of 2014 , sells soap into the form of Cup@@ cakes .
overall , it was the last loss in a genet@@ ically modified city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ou wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is alter@@ ation , but I can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York change is change , it is also new recovery .
a re @-@ revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts cards , but still has some of the same employee and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot .
in addition , the same distributor for excav@@ ators bought the same es@@ presso makers .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment with him .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu is sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are Gar@@ ni@@ es like hoo@@ ves and s@@ aut@@ é onions .
there are natural c@@ iss@@ ants .
the café is no beer more , but there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ oned electricity on an old stem .
&quot; many old customers were also stra@@ it@@ ened by prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recent on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after it was pulled to Green@@ point , it would take the way up .
after the Ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee @-@ t@@ ines , she said .
&quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and at the culture in the Ver@@ b , which I liked to me , &quot; she said .
now they drinks again coffee , even if they found coffee at this day instead of her regular ic@@ e. coffee maker C@@ hai Tea ordered , who is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and faithful client since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered innocent .
&quot; I came home after seven , every day , as a Swiss watch @-@ watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez , he wanted to experiment with and to record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal can still get his usual order , but sometimes it moves his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he has not taken a gar@@ bage over that the soap business has taken the old business area .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the coffee as a ingredient .
&quot; I think we &apos;ll go to their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
the café is also accepted and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he prepared to see her coming soon , making his new neigh@@ bors welcome .
the site has also other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee in the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighbouring building .
for many customers , a new de@@ af is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a pedi@@ atri@@ cian and said that he was destroyed in the ground , as the café has closed .
when the new Café opened , Wh@@ osoever appro@@ ached that the location of the loc@@ als and the purch@@ aser felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch in the O@@ val Office .
as Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roosevelt is a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen to Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water@@ plates .
its menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pav@@ ing p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with s@@ lei@@ gh@@ ing people , &quot; Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both Food hist@@ ori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; tra@@ ded out of the Chinese cuisine in the United States , during drawing in their book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
her newest collaboration , &quot; A permanent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the history of the American kitchen during the great depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they met with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , gra@@ k@@ ell@@ ous snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a glass cheese with olive trees , whilst co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pur@@ ée and vegetables .
when the Min@@ ter Hack@@ ney ordered , this was the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared out of a ingredient and a little less than the ingredient .
imagine , so many pe@@ an@@ uts have to eat that they serve them as a dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ d .
&quot; it must be like lead in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , mainly in rural areas , an all @-@ You Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women boiling for male athletes and it was served fresh past@@ ed past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
there were the Americans that sent during the first World War food to hungry Europeans . &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; records the paths where the country went to land no longer .
&quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans a central , shar@@ pen@@ ed theme , &quot; how did Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
the new Bud@@ get@@ ary was the same as the new Bud@@ get@@ ary : mysterious dishes such as loaves and c@@ asserole dish , the c@@ asserole , as &quot; wonderful species , Ess@@ enti@@ re@@ ya re@@ compens@@ ed , &quot; noted gyp@@ sum , because the precious food could hide under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drying .
meat that was at the heart of the American kitchen for many years , became a very rare luxury .
strange mixtures were tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ished satisfaction had to tast@@ ed before taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research on the book which also comprises recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , b@@ aked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular supplement for lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions don &apos;t fit in one another .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
as never before or since , household economy - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the eating hab@@ its of the country .
by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encour@@ ages women to become &quot; domestic sp@@ ectives &quot; and the challenge , ping as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical le@@ ak@@ age group .
in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmers in the kitchen of his kitchen , he has grown as the million strong man from the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a close @-@ up meal and put a tu@@ x@@ tu@@ ally .
he was del@@ ight@@ ful to real@@ ise .
President Roosevelt could have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to st@@ roll with his stomach .
as described in the book , the dra@@ ins of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs. Roosevelt , that the White House produced the most long @-@ time food in Washington , but also one of the most controversi@@ al . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food , was rejected once the country came back on the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science was applied on food .
the couple delivered to the writing of the eating hab@@ its in law in law in law to better - for example , as they could not throw away food .
&quot; they had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alls : &quot; they really made sick . &quot;

Greenland : the oldest sp@@ ine is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland is usually only in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swim with a 1 km / hour by the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland only with 150 years of offspring .
mixed swimming pool on the ground of the North Atlantic is located on average , in an hour , on average , it is only 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it comes on , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and it &apos;s top speed as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle seems to be a reflection concept for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues tell the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case of a Greenland , 392 years old .
&quot; mad &quot; , commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life expectancy , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
indeed , the ev@@ olu@@ tionary biolog@@ ist believed that Greenland is long ago .
only the evidence is missing .
Greenland is difficult to observe , finally , they live mainly in the Eis@@ meer mainly in the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because they prefer to water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
more than the lifestyle of the Greenland &apos;s lifestyle is correspon@@ d@@ ingly less .
her time @-@ up emp@@ tied them , having equi@@ val@@ ed six animals with a transmitter in front of the Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen .
nevertheless this shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed up the pine bones of a young ice .
possibly hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the basis of the ice me@@ ar and look for Kad@@ esh , which are from higher water layers according to the bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centi@@ metres long , while the largest 502 centi@@ meter measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of shar@@ ks with carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens has been created before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained in the form of the proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens @-@ core .
their birth should therefore lie down after the early 1960s than nuclear weapons attempts to drag larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
in which , with 220 centi@@ metres of length , the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon , it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012 .
all major species of Greenland , normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities had been produced by cosmic ray in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 Clock showed an age of 335 years for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ metres long Greenland , while the record shar@@ k should be 392 years old .
that the females still get offspring after the Greenland , when they are longer than four meters , was well known .
now the researchers examined the length of an old age .
as one of the animals with 392 centimeters will probably be determined on the threshold for the sexually mature and its age with 156 years , Greenland &apos;s growth is obviously at least one and a half centuries .
this also could be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such Meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live primarily in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
also the old record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland , was caught on Alaska with a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on head , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organ@@ ism of the living animals remain on as@@ par@@ agus .
then they cross it later - and let it slow down .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface due to the animal in heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on it as soon as possible as many offspring , &quot; says the Evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein .
in contrast , a very big animal should actually invest its resources in a long life .

in a ranking of business consultancy Mer@@ cer stands the city at rank 7 , Luxembourg at No.@@ 19 and Paris on No.@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7. place .
even if life quality is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial centre for the European inland market , Frankfurt might have further banks and investors &apos; , the I@@ W is continuing .

in a sharp contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind wrong words and tra@@ ilers in relation to its previous promises to publish his tax explained .
it is common to publish their tax announ@@ cements in common for US presidential candidate , although they are not obliged by law for this purpose .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers as a reason for his ref@@ usal to refuse a tax investigation by the tax authorities .
&quot; they are on train , &quot; Clinton wrote the elec@@ toral campaign of Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate in Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps special advis@@ ers , to CN@@ N noted that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release anything before tax checks are not finished .

on Thursday the subject also said during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other presidential candidate has done for decades in recent decades and his tax explained . &quot; she said to the crowd .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or very low taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist for the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax ad@@ visory service , the data that could still be the case .

Jewish director cr@@ ush@@ es Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; uph@@ old &quot; - RT News
a French director of Jewish roots having revealed a media record after he had betrayed the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pre @-@ selection since it would have requested Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the &quot; Shoah &quot; by holding his anger at the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the country &apos;s pre @-@ selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel over its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel area .
the answer which he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel said that the intervention made a &quot; clear decision of the management of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotels . &quot;
the reason that passed behind , dis@@ band@@ ed more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arab and you have demanded that the pre@@ fix is deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a big dis@@ grace , &quot; reported the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied from this event and dis@@ ma@@ iled .
that is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this is posted in exactly this hotel chain in Germany , is even bigger dis@@ grace .
this is no explanation .
we expect the hotel &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister .
the incident struck a fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet , where people know the whole a sc@@ and@@ al .
some sub@@ set to the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel , that it would have had the inn@@ ate view of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed of you , &quot; it &apos;s been noted in another contribution where it was noted that the hotel is located on a noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm in the vicinity of a synagogue .
the hotel quickly showed up all the alleg@@ ations of itself and called the incident a &quot; Ver@@ b &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ ze &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; to record Israel into the quick list . &quot; the southern German newspaper Wiener Zeitung quoted a speaker of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotels .
it adds that the country code has now been added .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
with the repe@@ al of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran is a year @-@ on @-@ year comparison by 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been abolished , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in the country , according to ambassador .
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to create access to the market .
of course , the additional trading company is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
it noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 , compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the commercial up@@ swing was reached by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian foreign represent@@ ations made about 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily on rice citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which relate to the number of places in Russia .
you could say that the record number of Iranian tourists came in Russia from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Rus@@ sians attend Iran , something of whom the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally , the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d recommend to have received the monuments of the old Persian civil@@ ization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms back home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the company &apos;s team @-@ spr@@ int in Rio into the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , as the British team def@@ ended the title of London in 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor roll , who had made his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . he made the legend proud of having crossed home to home a victory of Favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking win four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic ol@@ d@@ medals .
they repeated the trick , after being held in March at the railway world championships in London despite the back@@ feeding Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that tried K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed when she saw potential in the vill@@ i , who now un@@ fold it now .
Hin@@ y , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y du@@ cks - and Sk@@ inner in the qualification round a Olympic champion , but in the position round the New Zealand &apos;s st@@ ills in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
behind his round it was barely back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team back to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategy change made a large part of transformation from where Hin@@ des in a higher gear took to slow down and it &apos;s Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert from and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and hin@@ der when they rose to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a tasty comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and make me a name .
in the En@@ dr@@ one Olympi@@ ad , we set up an Olympic champion and defe@@ ats the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , there was a weak start confi@@ d@@ ently onto the railway .
he returned this saying later and there was no appeal to England .
for such an outstanding victory there was no such issue this time .
Hin@@ des said , &quot; It feels like London &apos;s all GB flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we are so bad at so many world titles so that it was incredibly to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if a barometer of our progress has been in the last five months , we expect to expect successful five days in the vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is possible in the realm of Pos@@ sible , that he is winning Ho@@ ys winning three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently most holy date for the British sport ) . Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born .
the che@@ que of Ho@@ y equals .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which today begins and going for over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoys this just for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
it can win with his colleagues .
it feels something to win alone , alone .
Hin@@ des said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts of the day but there was more good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dy W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ bs qualified up with the fastest power in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 942 at the finish .
the World Record , who won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be staged on the second day of the contest , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he had fought against the qualification round before the qualification when they called him to measure his height .
in the same women &apos;s competition , continuing and finish , av@@ anced Laura Des@@ p@@ ate , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald at world record time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving at his strong train team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a band of medals .
according to a truly exceptional representation of absolute Domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were down .
there were drama in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the Technical Director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and Mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ pre@@ fers and the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
however , when you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite then that the legendary reputation GB@@ S , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
the Future of melt from Portland due to the repe@@ al of the energy contract
the future of the aluminum mel@@ ts of Portland in Victoria and hundreds of work@@ stations - are available at the game because the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , which will resolve all supply contracts , such as the supplier of energy companies .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria early this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant .
a payout for 20 years is running in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the corner of Al@@ coa in Portland are available on the game .
not less than 2000 work stations -@@ direct or indirect - may be end@@ anger@@ ed at any time .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ as , since the melting plant is around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melt , which led last year on a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closing time .
this step follows the years of developing spec@@ ulations in regards to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the powerful Australian dollar and last@@ ly due to the current price of the system .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium shells with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , reported that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japan Mar@@ ub@@ en@@ i Cor@@ p are holding smaller propor@@ tions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to be operated in Portland , which means further physical demand for electricity by using the melt , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L still said that the tre@@ aties @-@ called &quot; backup transactions , &quot; which should be in force starting in November 2016 .
the tre@@ aties have a 12 month period of notice that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; hence , AG@@ L of them goes out that the contracts for the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenues , &quot; said the supply of the supply .
all of the potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong schedule prices .
AG@@ L shared with the value of contracts already written in his annual financial statements of $ 187 million in &quot; waiting for a cancellation . &quot;
Al@@ coa told that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &apos; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or the power supply to the melt &apos; do not imp@@ aired .
the US company said that in 2010 , it had completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have come into effect from November this year , even if there is still a statement , why it has returned from the contract .
analysis of analy@@ st due to the bad economic conditions of the sector in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the Analy@@ st beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland annually produces about 600 megawatts and Tom@@ ago around 900 megawatts .
if both plants should disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; power market &#93; .
and for us as generating sets this is not good , &quot; he said .
more than just a cardi@@ ac reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of Vog@@ ue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the El@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and running at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on its Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday .
&quot; in a room of full people I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers to wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the dis@@ closure of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an ) , which ends the entire Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner &apos;s family ( with the exception of the problem of bi@@ z @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ cre@@ as ) : they are all planned with a classic del@@ ights : they all have a sur@@ prises planned .
this is the kl@@ isch@@ ee@@ zed act of a children &apos;s birthday ( Se@@ ac@@ cre@@ st resulted in the proposition , &quot; You did believe that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a animation at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part their other girls somehow to the Public@@ ity .
with a view to the September edition of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began .
K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes them , what the Vog@@ ue Cover is defeated ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league .
the Sept@@ ember@@ edition is for Vog@@ ue the most sold edition of the year .
with a volume which is rather similar to a fashion magazine than a fashion magazine resem@@ bles the output a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 615 pages on advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars are expected to see that in the last two years the magazine published pictures of the magazine even before the official announcement .
women who were already in the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ities , the Mod@@ ules , &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ r@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low probability that Mr@@ s J@@ enner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; di@@ pping model &quot; of their generation - is located in a good company , in a good company .
these celeb@@ r@@ ities are not related to famous people , or reality Stars or young people from today that know how to shoot a good snap@@ shot video ( even if everything is directed to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was quite anxi@@ ous in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the mist@@ ress of the moment . &quot;
the feelings of boiling back high , when the message came with the appearing J@@ enn@@ er on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but to deal with the mist@@ akes seems to be attached at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of Vog@@ ue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a superb model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
you make advertising for your footprint of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell your pictures from their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
she sells pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the LO@@ VE magazine .
and in their leisure time it is possible to see the reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centers show annually 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the aid from the country is rejected by the country &apos;s municipal centers each year , while the industry &apos;s impact on the effects of further cuts already over@@ loaded .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three of five people - mostly elderly people , immig@@ rants , vulner@@ able workers , victims of violence and those who have no means to do not have any funds for un@@ real estate coun@@ sel@@ ors and like any legal request .
legal services of the municipality , which are already out@@ law@@ ed already , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , this legal centres will lose another 30 per cent of their federal states .
the Director of the Municipal Cent@@ res of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people had been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation without repe@@ aling the decision of the German government would only be worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land Community centres are chron@@ ically organized , which means thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who rely on violent relations , people with un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able and pres@@ op@@ pressed liabilities , families who have been dismissed by divi@@ ding workers , workers who have un@@ disp@@ uted problems - all these people have problems just@@ i@@ fi@@ able , they can not get the help you need them .
the federal government will cut its funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning thousands of help people from Que@@ ens@@ land have to be forced to just@@ ify their legal issues without any help .
we call for the General Public Prosecutor and the Federal Minister of Justice and the Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis , to stop this central ab@@ brevi@@ ations , so that people may need help them with legal problems .
last year , the state government filled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now at the time to meet the needs of the municipal centres and their client communities , as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey on countries elections : SPD and CDU lose
in the general elections in the Federal State of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses are characterised by the g@@ overning party SPD and the CDU .
this resulted in representative surveys of opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red black g@@ overning coalition could not continue down@@ ward in the north , this is not possible after transfer@@ ring values in Berlin .
in both federal states the SPD would have the strongest party and would have good chances to set out the state of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collap@@ sed by 3@@ 5.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
the party l@@ ayed so far not just ahead of the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country .
despite a slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens came again in the sever@@ ity of land .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented with 3 percent each in the country .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD in the survey said to only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
this was still passing by gre@@ enery with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17,@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented with 14 percent for the first time in the Congress of Represent@@ atives .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would miss the action in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ Mail and Internet in tim@@ ber@@ yl : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - its producer experienced a disaster .
the app@@ weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as tough as an iPhone 5 .
it was di@@ cker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was fairly close .
the built @-@ in memory amounted to eight Meg@@ abytes , that would be enough for about two sel@@ f@@ ters with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros enthusiasts can buy the devices yet on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age .
however , 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the western pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to be sent and received a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax it was the Communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers if even tor@@ mented slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone couldn &apos;t be opened like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black and white screen were found .
rather , the price was : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was Euro 392 million in 2015 .
nobody was able to rent the Communic@@ ator of the beginning of the smartphone era in August 1996 .
since then everything is different .
the wise teleph@@ ones are a success story , although not for Nokia .
the mobile phone card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented example , was finally sold at Microsoft .
the market today are providers that all had a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere , that &apos;s today for very many people everyday .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone , there are just 555 million units .
the worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
the well running shops of the countless app vend@@ ors and the telecommunic@@ ations con@@ serves .
a whole industry has produced around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market occurred at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple chef announced Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World &apos;s introduction to the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three tools in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communication , all by touch screen easy to use .
the winning stre@@ ak of the Apple began today , today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the exception .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
now you have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the Smartphone is a self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility for 20 years .
on average each German now looks on its mobile today 88 times a day .
&quot; we have to learn all of the smartphone &apos;s smartphone , &quot; just Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens Board responsible for personnel .
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must enlarge the Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local communities and throughout London , but bring to the whole country of renewal and prosper@@ ity .
for me , this was the largest attraction in He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions were benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be reached again by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we are awarding 10,000 new apprentices to create 40,000 new jobs and a youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead in London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ row is too large .
I have told me that England will never be ready for the games and we will play on the world stage .
the two fl@@ yers had wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to van@@ ishing , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for a infrastructure project .
an option is an option to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ty growth , and a legacy of skills and employment for the international airport to be left as well as in the whole of the GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion expensive investment program in time and budget , from T5 - the five year in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies of the world .
now they are ready to provide a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the enlargement of He@@ ath@@ row is also to be one .
it is time that we turn this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row and create our future trading and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Maus@@ oleum &quot; regarding display block
for companies that earn money with online advertising make money according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to block advertising block , a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and Maus@@ oleum . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would be re@@ mot@@ ely blocked off its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post that users could update their filters in the program to block other advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook was told that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the coding regarding its advertis@@ ements related to displays , which is part of the page advertising , to be difficult .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the an@@ odi@@ an open source community and the envelop@@ es has been in progress since the invention of advertising pic@@ king in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has dropped in the struggle , is a powerful Indi@@ z for how to become wor@@ r@@ ying display of the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ m@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people will use display of advertising ; nearly four times so much in 2013 .
with 1.0@@ 3 billion active users , who access Facebook through their mobile devices , makes hands @-@ advertising 84 percent of the promotion features fac@@ eb@@ ooks .
the company has been based on display blocks on desktop computers as mobile display block@@ ers doesn &apos;t have any effect on Fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , one of the speaker .
advertisement on desktop PC makes a sufficient large proportion of income , so Facebook appears to be worth a worth it .
on Tuesday , Facebook reported that his &quot; display case tool &quot; would be updated to control the people more control over it .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks have new filter wor@@ r@@ ying , because they would also block content on the side , which are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
display block@@ ers are a silent agent , so why we focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman with suspected self @-@ suicide on the Swiss highway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the fre@@ eway .
the police call for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with an assumed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman taken in the dark &quot; in a act of desp@@ air &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , that of several vehicles , including a direct car , was transferred to himself who wanted to kill himself .
she passed away on site .
several drivers have already been taken , but some are still not identified , the police reported to report these as well as any witnesses of the incident .
it was opened an investigation , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , issued G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter before the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the driver will be displayed .
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
that is something that the prosecutor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the past five years show that the driver will not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - where a person in the Dark On@@ es ran out on the highway - it was decided that the drivers had not going out to go out in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acquitted when they had over@@ ride a man and had killed a man who lay a night close to Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man had drunk , and was un@@ conscious in the street , he took judgment .
the Court asser@@ ted that the police officer who had responded to an emergency call -- on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was &quot; entirely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judges .
everyone who has more information regarding the incident on Thursday near Morges should report at the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was inhabited according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model probably instantly hab@@ itable .
scientist at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies , NASA developed a model to discover the past of the Venus on the basis of tools and algorith@@ ms that similar to climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once have been recorded with its hot , water @-@ loose surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere .
scientists have previously stated that the slow revolution of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ similar atmosphere , and still turned slowly .
the model illuminated by the early Venus as well .
the planet probably pointed out more dry places than the Earth , but had once enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protect life before rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS @-@ Modell@@ simulation , the long revolution of the Venus continued its daily turn of the sun for nearly two months &quot; , G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io declared in a press release .
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which looks like a rain umbrella to prevent the surface of a large majority of sun heat .
the result are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus which resem@@ bles the evolution that previously believed by Plan@@ etary research .
although they were likely to be hab@@ itable , the Venus &apos; was exposed over much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burnt down from ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen was dischar@@ ged only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect - the Venus , which we know them today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus Climate @-@ od@@ ells in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research .
Patrick Roy goes back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and vice president of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led an easy grant of the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and understood that the association will be searching immediately after a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I have been the Chief Executive Officer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and destination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy was expressed in an opinion .
I have thought during the summer long and much about it , as I could improve this team to give it more depth to give it a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be matched to the organisation of the organization .
he must also have a fundamental right to control the performance of the team .
conditions of these conditions are not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , which had been appointed by Roy on May 23 , 2013 , op@@ pressed with him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the winner of the Jack Adam Award as winner of the Best Trainer of League during his debut season during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 .
he led the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the play@@ offs of Minnesota , and missed out in each of the two past years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches completed a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell by five points behind the Wild @-@ card spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ ry won Roy four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers take discussions again , rely on strike
the working conflict with the re@@ mun@@ eration for North @-@ oil workers are exposed to the table during all disp@@ utes ar@@ ising from the table , negoti@@ ating negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the oil field service Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms at the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and r@@ ush@@ ers can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ unified the current track process , &quot; says it in a common statement .
we will stop some full @-@ day sessions during the next weeks , who will start next year to re @-@ start the problems .
the unions said that its last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against potential pay@@ ings of up to 30 percent .
furthermore , Wood Group has given the inst@@ al@@ ments of his contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s ratings are followed by a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the enterprise provides the necessary space to come through the market up@@ swing .
Shell has dismissed for its part of thousands of people and plans to give his oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it rati@@ onal@@ ised its business activities as a result of his meg@@ ac@@ tionary approach with the UK energy company BG Group .
energy companies are located under pressure from the lower gross oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that step@@ ped down by the decision of the British in June to rein@@ force the European Union .
the Scottish parliament Dave Anderson met with workers in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the largest industrial conflict which took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and all the country we need a economy that works for many and not just for few , &quot; said he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star@@ ring of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
with the Kepler Wel@@ ding teles@@ cope , astronom@@ ers have helped to collect the complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ er , why stars in star care@@ ers are rotating at different rates as well as in which respect the rot@@ ational space with the planetary observ@@ ations .
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ isons of our results with other star@@ ters , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 445 light@@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this cluster , created around 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they are now fastest on the fastest .
these gri@@ ev@@ ing stars get out of these gri@@ pping stars out of star@@ ches .
since the winch has come through the stars of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
if a star affects , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of any death by pressing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able constellation -- as sun spot -- recognize .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicate that more massive star can spin more than a less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ters than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors en@@ tend to be massive , some faster rot@@ ors that tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars are going to slow down its rot@@ ational rates and so to tell their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues were recorded in detail on their newest analysis of the ro@@ yalty @-@ rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the astronom@@ ical Journal soon .
a controversi@@ al bas@@ eball @-@ star occurs from
tears run at Alex Rodri@@ guez than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days from Base @-@ Base .
after his emotional re@@ sign@@ ation , the 41 year old professional will carry a last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time in his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; to the &apos; , the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times , Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
in 2007 , his signature under one ten year contract signed a total of 27 million US dollars annually .
until the end of the contra@@ diction on 31 December 2017 , he will also serve as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 he made several milestones .
with the Hall of Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays take only two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be accepted into the glory hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - sur@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so controversi@@ al appearance outside of the square .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star was associated with &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; which was forbidden from 2001 to 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games by an execution in the so @-@ called Bio@@ Gen@@ esis Sk@@ and@@ al until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is the master susp@@ icious for years to have long lasting over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida .
after a legal dispute , the sperm still has been reduced to 162 encoun@@ ters .
&quot; the league could even have a favour for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , Rodri@@ guez said then at the time .
even his f@@ are@@ well days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball Legends in their last games played the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit frequently on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include any f@@ are@@ well tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe gir@@ ard@@ i .

Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski came first d@@ oping slope
wi@@ ped : for a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ sample , weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski from Poland will not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be sh@@ ad@@ owing by the first official dam .
a ignor@@ ant athl@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ ra@@ ids developed the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish @-@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski were tested positive and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the coh@@ er@@ ical athlet@@ ics cont@@ ests , these messages are coming to the accident .
in Chen was already proven the di@@ ure@@ tics of hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ d last Sunday , which is used as m@@ ask@@ an agent for D@@ op@@ ing@@ Sub@@ roads .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games in Friday .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , just by 0.09 seconds it missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Chen was supposed to have been able to take over 50 m Freestyle .
Chen has requested the opening of the B trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the National Federation take the matter &quot; very serious and demands by Chen &apos;s full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
not for the first time in history the IOC is not responsible for the rehabilitation of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio le@@ ak@@ ens the message about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is not guilty , &quot; the only explanation could be a dietary supplement , &quot; explained the Track &amp; Athlet@@ ics Men .
according to the report , it is said to deal with the associated substance of blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ means EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was given provisional release , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should also be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow told her face with criticism at the Ath@@ en@@ ic Bulletin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , about all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ters from chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ loaded nation may not be present in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested negative for his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ on .
both cat@@ ching the in@@ gest@@ ion , however , they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athl@@ ete , Dan@@ ek@@ ova was another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had the complete Russian team until an exception for systematic D@@ op@@ ings , even the l@@ ur@@ nation of Kenya produced numerous poor news in Rio .
during the bu@@ oy@@ ancy sport , the former off@@ ences in China had ensured around the athl@@ ete between athletes .
thus the Fr@@ ench@@ man Camil@@ le Lac@@ y@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt l@@ il@@ ah . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Freestyle , I will hand over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t said in French radio .
sun also stood at the heart of a con@@ front@@ ation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and respect for D@@ oping @-@ che@@ er , &quot; said this .
sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese championships positive on stim@@ ul@@ ans tri@@ met@@ ac@@ ia , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
datashe@@ et : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ acker their rans@@ om
programmer of release @-@ malware infection currently has targeted companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware infection specialists , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes is less than 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany over 40 percent of surveyed companies in the last twelve months have at least once , partly several times of an attack with express software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware market .
40 percent of victims paid attention to the perpet@@ rators required by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their express software according to the observ@@ ations by Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes on attacks in corporate networks .
are they successful there , the potentially comp@@ res@@ sible lion money falls clearly higher than in private use .
&quot; we look at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ k chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski talks with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most pain@@ ters programs were still designed to send advertising .
then discovered the perpet@@ rator software for himself .
however , private use was the goal , but the transition to the company &apos;s neck was sho@@ ck@@ ingly fast in the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is working according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , she seek@@ ed specifically for un@@ altered files like e.g. Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as in archives of pictures and videos .
these files encrypted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustainable .
next , the software announces the requirements of the nar@@ press@@ er .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files you need to transfer the victim &apos;s money - usually in the form of crash lens Bit@@ coin .
but where private use is the personal photo database on the game , it is custom@@ ised for companies by sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage should be taken if a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent had to be completely sub@@ du@@ ed , in case of a case people were in Fat@@ al .
in Germany several hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened with the loss of patient &apos;s health .
&quot; we say the victims , &quot; it is not only paying the issue , &quot; says K@@ rich@@ z@@ yn@@ ski .
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay to get their data .
for managers it is difficult to re@@ ject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in the operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , safety for@@ researchers from F @-@ Secure exam@@ ines the payload areas and contact us to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to form a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain its victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin to pay free access websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and are saved priv@@ at@@ ers to payments of a few hundred euro , companies must pay part hard beat and five digit sum@@ s to withdraw their data .
in view of the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky win@@ nings from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware market , h@@ acker will always share professional and share the work , explains security professionals from the Internet @-@ provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that there are three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their damage software then in the form of a software architecture to the actual express .
the new malware kits produced by introducing the malware , advis@@ ing and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; the scope of supply is an adap@@ table tool , so that smaller configuration , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski .
the release is then looking for a further h@@ acker to spread the newly introduced software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one lo@@ dges in one of the for@@ ums in the underground , buying the set from a crimin@@ als and for another one to install the software on as many PCs .
payment is made by per classi@@ fi@@ able calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ als then apply to the dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ewski explains .
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known for many companies that secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ ag@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust in order to be able to collect R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanners .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators will pursue new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpet@@ rators , with the publication of sensitive data , such as customer sol@@ o@@ ists or price reductions , &quot; explains Mal@@ not@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ rich@@ z@@ yn@@ ski .
with this , the claim report on the type of data is more multiple than before .
in the future , the perpet@@ rators now also might take completely new targets on the Internet of Things .
on the h@@ ack@@ er@@ conference principle , safety for@@ gers demonstrate how to get a thermo@@ stat among the Internet connected under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of a type blocked heating such as many victim could be a rans@@ om .
if the do@@ er then block a whole production line in a factory in the future , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be an issue in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the little HR @-@ V Honda wants to un@@ pack everything : a little SUV , a little Coupé and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds quite exc@@ up@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , was actually extremely flexible in everyday life .
although only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear . no spot works closely at any spot .
the materials of the indoor space are well @-@ processed and work comfortable , only the cockpit of the cockpit is something wrong .
versatile than comparable vehicles is HR @-@ V at the storage space .
it is not just a trunk storage of 453 l at high and 10@@ 26 l when folded back @-@ rests but it gives the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical , than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be up as chin @-@ up and offer the storage room which is high up to the ceilings 1,@@ 24 m high .
the boot space can be loaded well , however , the loading height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
with an output of 88 kW / 120 hp , the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine accelerates the HR @-@ V with a torque range of up to 300 Nm .
he is likely to create a lot of qui@@ eter .
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
another engine is available : a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
the steering is likely to be a bit of direct .
the equipment is in the tested Top version , &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes .
the City emergency braking assistant belongs to the security systems ( works up to 32 ) , the coll@@ isions system and the trace assistant .
the coll@@ ision war@@ n ir@@ r@@ ents sometimes because he has rated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ah@@ ende objects . &quot;
the remote device works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to traffic sign recognition and thr@@ ott@@ le when necessary .
however , the full connectivity is only available for the top configuration : 7 @-@ inch touchscreen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More .
two USB and a HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore something ar@@ able to reach .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel engines are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the gasoline model will receive 20,000 euros , the diesel will receive more than 23@@ ,000 euros .
the motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday @-@ looking car .
Airline not adher@@ es : down@@ fall on the air@@ lift
a Airline cannot be liable for the fall of a passenger on the air@@ lift .
for liability is possible only by d@@ angers , which are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken down a kne@@ e in the fall .
however , the accident would have occurred everywhere - it acts as a general life @-@ risk , so the Court .
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease fall : when paid the organizer
after their journey he will spend money back after their journey , when the cause of the disease is und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly found in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests showed the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case a family on the second day of her Turkish li@@ qu@@ ay was badly affected by di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and vom@@ iting .
she spent nearly the entire vacation in the room .
their disease carried away the vac@@ ation@@ ships on a def@@ ective se@@ wage , which supp@@ os@@ edly poll@@ ute the sea@@ water .
the family was the view , that the journey would have been a lack of business and def@@ endants against the organizers .
before the court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the cl@@ ash was def@@ ective in fact .
but the organizer could only be done shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then that sea water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the judgment .
since the samples of the water have no im@@ pur@@ ities .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ red by pressing one another - are a general life risk .
one of 6@@ 91 guests were recorded only 38 .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after refugees committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people have been wor@@ ried about suggestions .
the state had to occupy and decided to react to terrorist attacks .
safe : our country is not going to answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hat@@ red and split .
we won &apos;t go to the terror@@ ists .
if insur@@ ers would have to leave the country faster , however , the level of safety and strength of the population of refugee policy are also rising faster .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement a implementation of the proposals by the Bundestag election in 2017 .
he also announced another personal gain of security forces , namely in medium @-@ digit size rules over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ y advertising for terrorism has come again under punishment .
video surveillance shall be improved , which will be w@@ ron@@ ged as amended by the weapons of weapons in the internet .
the most discussed silence for doctors is supposed to remain according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
however , in dialogue with the doctors , he wants to search for solutions like the end@@ anger@@ ment of citizens , he said with view on psych@@ ic view .
to counter@@ act a radi@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister holds a better social support for the period .
teachers would have to be prepared better for dealing with trau@@ matic persons .
for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of major investigations .
the SPD Chef Gabriel told : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that will help others to enhance safety . &quot;
it was important that the Minister of the Interior was clearly stated against action .
&quot; this was a ear@@ ching for the sm@@ ash in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the fun@@ ct media group ( Friday ) .
in May , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère was rejected by the Union for a bur@@ ka prohibition and the abol@@ ition of double citizenship .
the general prohibition of full @-@ sw@@ elling can be problem@@ atic for constitutional problems .
you can &apos;t offer everything you re@@ jects , and I have with@@ drew the wearing of bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules for traffic or witness to the Court .

a look at the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .

this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in the traffic on the ambient road every evening in the stadium when they travel via the highway Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction started at the upcoming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the field between Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler road left lane at 700 meters .
drivers can go directly from the hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic can be improved to early , thus ensuring that the general exp@@ iry of the multi @-@ prop@@ elled section of the federal highway 51 is improved .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the lane thrust at the Zu@@ w@@ inger nerv@@ es the drivers mostly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the back goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h route , and sometimes also beyond that .
reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler road .
from here , traffic turns only a track to the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be re@@ built before a good three @-@ four@@ ths of years ago .
the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge not have the necessary load capacity to absorb the heavy loads in particular .
as long as this Eng@@ pass and the associated commercial rush will continue , the competent state can not say .
however it is estimated with years : for the bridge has an official rest of rest up to the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal storage esp@@ ur the state has been deliber@@ ately chosen during school holidays because with disabilities .
the traffic will be guided at the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .

relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening one roll around for ever@@ more , at night you will walk far from sleep in the morning , in the morning , much more to sleep .
that &apos;s all others as a relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep ins@@ om@@ nia and more than ten percent , find their sleep frequently or not a permanent .
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ b@@ ance ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , and there may be many causes of causes under@@ lying , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , Ste@@ ering Committee of the German Society for Sle@@ eves and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what we under@@ stands among them is , but the In@@ som@@ nie , so is an input and sleeping @-@ like .
just this , many people go out as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ni@@ cht , Member of the board of the German household association with practice in Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleep distur@@ b@@ ance ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
organic , psych@@ ic or di@@ alog@@ y @-@ related factors , but also medic@@ ations are stuck .
not rare is the distur@@ bing expression of another condition .
&quot; very early w@@ aking up is especially recommended by depression . &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it can be that various factors need to one another .
anyone who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie bad , watches all two to three hours and starts to gre@@ e about everyday problems and sa@@ w@@ ling , there is We@@ e@@ ß one example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is not possible anymore .
from when should you sleep with ins@@ om@@ nia to the doctor ?
those who don &apos;t sleep over a period of a month in at least three nights per week and should be imp@@ aired on the day should go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look completely different : one is ab@@ ro@@ uted , tired , tired , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has sw@@ elling fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints like stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate the disorder , it is important to find their causes .
as a treatment options , inter @-@ behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medic@@ ations - classic sleep tablet is only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks - in@@ quiries .
in Germany it is hardly noticeable in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ xes , head of the inter@@ disciplinary or medical centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
the case , that is why you should contact with sleeping difficulties at first time , at a we@@ av@@ ant We@@ e@@ ß .
the problem can clari@@ fy whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
for the investigation in the sleep laboratory , He@@ aler for example , with breathing difficulties , for example with breathing difficulties , if sleeping , or if you do not find the cause of a passage in sleep .
it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; but please make no no@@ where , &quot; says Fi@@ bre .
after gradu@@ ation , one gets to his normal time into the bed .
beside the electrodes the body is wearing a nose g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a anten@@ n@@ ae on the finger .
in addition , a camera will feature the blan@@ ket over the ceiling .
how can those affected the problems get in the grip ?
there are quite a lot of positions in which you can set up for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular ins@@ ens@@ - and rise times , not to sleep in the bed , not to sleep in the day , not watching television to sleep , alcohol , and at night not begin at the clock - then it begins to count immediately , and that &apos;s all at all .
what the jung@@ le camp with lack of medals in swim
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ man is sold via Facebook to dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olympi@@ is .
in December 2014 he brought gold for the first time at the short circuit Championships in Doha , and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook has been protected in front of his former ex @-@ team mates .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € reward and a jung@@ le d@@ ump@@ y € 150,000 is no idea about lack of medals . &quot; he wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night to Friday on his Facebook page .
the transport system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping control was very good .
with that , we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not see the subject of d@@ oping in this way or even operate .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set , &quot; he stated .
he wanted to start a com@@ eback , would have to be reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency in Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
just like that one should keep it with countries .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a certain time prior to the World Cup / OS by independent controller , WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A will not be able to participate , &quot; calls for the election @-@ Hamburger , who now runs a ice ren@@ ele .
airport : bonds of Bag@@ gage
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the Düsseldorf Airport
the civilian population of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police accomplished the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the facts had committed as a ban@@ de several pocket and baggage ste@@ els .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants carried out in the area of the Airport Düsseldorf a ban@@ de that was known for the police officers from last theft .
since mid @-@ July , the two women and two men had committed several crimes committed during the middle of July and were very professional .
the specialists in the Cri@@ mean Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can re@@ ject the slide , which went to Germany to commit criminal off@@ ences to Germany .
thus they had carried over 15,000 Euro in total .
formerly buildings , a couple of Lin@@ den@@ h@@ edge , in between yet another lim@@ estone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ at@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works in the first sight , but the police is among the &quot; dangerous locations &quot; of the city .
walk along the road from east to west , one gets on playing places , a refresh@@ ed child garden and a be@@ ol@@ ades .
on the facade of a gray house , someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite a Li@@ dl , which should also be demolished soon , is already built : by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new rentals .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , are illustrated in the last weeks , however , preferably with burning cars .
ground is the house with the number 94 : once it was busy , the residents acquired rental contracts , but the ground floor are still occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin inner city of Berlin has several times , since the beginning of the year , the police against the project deci@@ de@@ dly called &quot; no @-@ go Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after 22 June the rooms were cleared on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers were cleared , according to 30 to 40 civil servants and three team@@ work on site , locked parts of the road and last visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers changed the premises on behalf of the unknown house owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration court decided that the do@@ zer was illegal , and one day later , police and building worker went under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and people .
in this summer afternoon the road peace@@ fully : parents are going to walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are enter@@ tain@@ ed Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the hood projects , primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left force is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives since 1999 in the Kie@@ z , and J@@ ana * , which is here three children , are mainly from the police station .
with the inhabitants of the skin objects , they share the concern and genetic engineering .
it sounds not after a p@@ ine@@ z that surro@@ unds the majority of polishing from the v@@ and@@ al@@ ding left .
the tr@@ ench , the Berlin inside and the police between squ@@ ash and their neigh@@ bors , does not exist so far .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin actually was a traditional working class , which also has a lower average in comparison to the rest of the city and has high poverty .
also squ@@ at@@ ters and the new@@ born housing projects are already long to the p@@ ines : in 1990 , numerous houses in former GDR were occupied , among them almost the entire main@@ z street , close to the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under a regular road battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ s and are partly inhabited by people , which they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly becoming a mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ toral lin@@ ers from all over the world : with them , residents of GDR @-@ times and former house cultivated in their pine trees .
this is also noticeable in rentals , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings on the ri@@ gs are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them in raised disks or fresh@@ ly coated fac@@ ades , which were du@@ ed with paint clothes .
no other road was mentioned as often along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason why not all neigh@@ bors who see as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : off@@ ences such as body viol@@ ating is that nearly exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most important part of the off@@ ender make non @-@ damage reasons , which tend to meet the newly built buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives since 17 years in a rental house next to the controversi@@ al 94 , un@@ certainty may not be a speech .
what under@@ goes , it is serious : people in the 94 are their neighbours , which they have not been determined .
the famous burning cars also give it no more to the ri@@ gs in front of the ri@@ gs .
for the studied Archit@@ ec@@ in , her street is no criminal burning point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than what else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ at@@ er Straße - and remained .
therefore , it was so important that the local residents get their streets : from the police , the policy and the media that claimed to claim the De@@ ut@@ ory conditions suddenly in July .
however , in the eyes of the residents of the inhabitants , the road continues to be taken away : by mir@@ ab@@ less new buildings in former building g@@ aps , that would push the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction cannot be gu@@ essed . &quot;
but what should we do if any one never hear someone ?
in all sides of fru@@ stration , even during the police and the inhabitants .
for conc@@ iliation , who likes over paint bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , has no understanding : the hood and the left scene belonged to the p@@ ines .
whoever moves , should be aware of - just as someone who walks in a c@@ ym@@ per quarter , po@@ or@@ ly can compl@@ ain about noise .
all of the people shown above have therefore asked to be called by their real name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee officer
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ ers .
in addition , she is a social worker on site .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
social Educational in supports the team of administration at Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities , and who else has been mixed again .
Reg@@ ine customer from working re@@ is indicates that the honorary volunte@@ er seem to be than@@ k@@ ful that deu@@ ter@@ le is now , the je@@ al@@ ant wool of wool which has a problem .
so some - less mo@@ cked than rather on the multitude of task @-@ like spending , meant as the administration intended to write the position .
we searched an administration of management with a talent for languages and people , associated with an experience of social work in the field of social work , lifting a complete wool of wool .
yet administration is not its central area , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le comments .
above all , it is for organization , working with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been present for around six weeks .
she has a 50 @-@ percent job on three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ors &apos; and German ranks supported .
there are major and small issues , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
new containers soon will be available at the Was@@ enstraße
a serious problem has been recognized for some time , apartments for the connection fle@@ ets that have been recognized .
for the connection of connection , the municipalities are responsible .
you need to place refugees in their own or rented accommodation .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ rat , municipality and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not each owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search have been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to finds no private apartments .
it was not working so far to have been presented on private apartments so Deu@@ ver@@ le .
therefore , General Apartments must be contra@@ cted , as it is so beautiful .
a new container will be installed in the Was@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine client and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
in addition to a fixed lead @-@ up , an intern@@ ship places , training places , Euro jobs and education schem@@ es for refugees and migrants , have to be und@@ ou@@ ched .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help house @-@ master@@ ing , finish work - and motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , as An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
activity doesn &apos;t mean work .
the day requires a solid structure , tell Deu@@ ter@@ le and customer .
human beings would have to develop a sen@@ i@@ ority .
so it offers offers like sports , contacts with native and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so also board administration and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain the refugees that it takes just and the time sense of the time , for example , with language courses .
whoever doesn &apos;t have the feeling , he could not help Ur@@ bach , do not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate to integrate .
the significant majority are motiv@@ ated .
problem , however , says customer to be hon@@ est , &quot; People , where nothing goes nothing . &quot; the work of Deu@@ ter@@ le and the customer is therefore always motiv@@ ating others to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth job . &quot;
a difficult question : do they have fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says something clearly , &quot; what they are called n@@ ai@@ v . &quot; a residual risk could not be able and would not exclu@@ de them .
Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ izes are the hel@@ pers already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assassination bring them completely in call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so there must be main and volunteers on site and in the region according to activities .
in the background you always have a new push for refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach come back in the background .
do Germany need a limit ?
this question clearly says to answer , the policy of politics .
actually it is un@@ fair to introduce hel@@ pers on the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there where we would like to go , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the ur@@ b@@ acher has also been util@@ ized to integrate the previous people &apos;s rati@@ onal .
there are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
nevertheless , when people are in need , let them help them , both women are united .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : looking for a helicopter with helicopter
the police helicopter flew several areas for about one hour .
two unknown men are for@@ ci@@ ble on Friday morning at the age of 8.50 in a apartment house in a separate family home in Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the residents surprised the two and beat the fet@@ ched de in the escape .
both men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters in size , probably m@@ asked , carrying both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ dies .
they fled towards the city center .
for the hearing , the police replaced several strikes as well as a police helicopter .
the decline was without success .
perhaps the unknown , in fact , fell close to the apartment or in their escape .
