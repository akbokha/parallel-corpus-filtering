<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen, and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">German sports assistance were submitted to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala golden piles.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no way of awards to the sympathetic sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Lorbeersheet, Champions Tour Player of the year...</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and trade agreement TTP prevent both Clinton and trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidential campaign, however, are competing in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">He, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warned against it as the state of the economy can hurt - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton had to regulate the economy and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">In other hand it would be very different, asserting Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will make relief down massively, and he strongly turns strongly for a far tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, he has advantageous opportunities to open and need money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the tax would be increased to the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In which to be invested, Trump and Clinton will say almost wortas.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidates is announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are rejected by the state-critical Teachy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, at Trump, thus we could still share internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and drive the coal extraction in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is also possible to terminate the oil promotion so far as to terminate the Paris Climate Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">In contrast, Clinton wants to strengthen and demands renewable energies with their investment program: "a country will make the superpower of clean energies and create million jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want to be there."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, both competitors are not far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, which deal with internazifish trade agreements, do not want to sign either.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the United States will not want to isolate the international trade - rather than just American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Those that are then to be paid better then calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US Dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question isn't clear: once again he says, the minimum wage must not be changed, then he shall not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the next months should be likely to develop the tax policies of both bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one page is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to stimulate the growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him, that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton wants to ask at least of the rich ones that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is one of women who flee alone, almost for everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatic.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house has refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a big kitchen there are four women sitting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Everyone has a baby, which is most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in the arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He guises his eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother is starred on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Till they notice that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiled shortly and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Till we speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is part of Condrobs Business Manager, a carrier for social aid offers in Bavaria, and among others dealing with the topic women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north, in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made up the establishment together with Pro Familia and Munich trailers.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened officially.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - also not as visitors.</seg>

<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they have persecuted politically because of them torture or death, or because their families would send them as a hope for Europe," she tells you. "</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, some reasons behind the escape: "many steal away secretly, because they don't see any other way."</seg>
<seg id="25">In her home, she had experience with sexual violence, forced him, honor of honor, slavery, or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives her away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the escape that goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that the tugboat is for example a bottle of water a sexual action, is not a rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who think that the end, once they are anchored in Germany, is telling me.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, women in refugees would often have been regarded as minderous and worse.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to about 90 per cent of women who live in the housing in the north of Munich, estimates them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are not purely voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women be as usual that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they are not trusted that you have lived to talk about the earth, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often do not help to help, it will need more properties for them, asking Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district rule will be responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question whether they would like to know about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction of the jurisdiction, some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken there are something like that in shelters of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Schwaben alone, women are not separately accommodated but says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press secretary of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle-franken is available in some shared floors or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the European Parliament, the "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" also demands that women have to be accommodated separated by men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published in the committee, it says: "it is very important that men and women will be home separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy or become men and women to be accommodated together, there may be - persistent - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">All the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, stands in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">As much of the women of this protection, one can read the Andrang, which is located at the Haus in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been spoken that there is us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily start a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">The representative of the assistants have called for their union to approve new working measures with any disputes regarding a new treaty.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has requested his entire Council as of early September more working measures.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that there would have been an opportunity to worry about the concerns about the contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of external movers"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that finished a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give his hands and a official end of the eight months lasting the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But as Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counterplayers in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in receiving, I can't forbid that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation on most.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was the hand, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putto smile worked narrowly and it shotined little heat, even for his back-held conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said to his "loving friend" Putin - according to a report about five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to its old level before the crisis, but even further improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had been too many, than would never happen to be anything.</seg>
<seg id="11">With me, enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin has had a radiant, lasting cooling, that the state of affairs did not forget about Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first to mentioned in his submissions: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft in the Syrian border with Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow was dispossessed from reaction to the time.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin issued Putin and accused Ankara to have fallen in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The crime was even bigger, as it was committed by a paid friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetropes will be rebuild again, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Once it appeared, the Turks would bear the debt for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the most serious, the allegations of Chief officials were that Erdogans would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has declared this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the charge of the President of the Preogan President he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire is clearly on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan takes on first place all the friends who can get it after the last month at a failed coup d'etat of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attack on Turkey were also shaken at him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit hard against Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late aisle onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state-television budget also predicted fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural products will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara has shaken the West, since it proved its response to power, proved to be a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the persisting Groll pass over the eve of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike insists to draw from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian state of State won a bonus that he demanded after the attempted coup d "état for the chosen state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well worth a self-intelligibility that has to change even a deep fear of rain.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this magnificent palace at the sea allowed it to Russia and Turkey, one who once described me an analyst, "Alliance of external people" states: two countries that are fcast off the west and poorly covered.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still differences between the two still differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace-sharpened role, but where Russia and Turkey were supported by wilful pages.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be noted that after almost three hours to first talks both preteners on the press conference, they would have noticed this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey kept it intentionally to answer a question about its differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">It is no clear consensus in front of where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after the months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential of a perfect disaster as NATO member of Russia, the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state should speak at least.</seg>

<seg id="16">I say now that we do not track global goals, but also local targets.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these stamps will work in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with customers.</seg>

<seg id="20">It would have been very zynical 3 years ago when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.</seg>

<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of the Kremlin it says (in Russian) that he later became the director and government leader of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of head and inspections on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov asked this to leave his position and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step did turn mysterious Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidentiality Vladimir Putin and works as he has been working for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcasted in TV, both men claimed that Chief of Staff was back on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only few of them convinces - especially in front of the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power combat?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is no one knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was appointed to be a potential President once again wants to forward the Russian environmental policy - overthrew in large skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov said it's true that I asked you to a talk in early 2012 - I could almost say this very difficult item - one could almost say - become a permanent position for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it emerged, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before he became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin was a former member of the State Security Service of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service of Security Service (FSB), the KGB was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin met the power he named Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was assumed that Ivanov might have been the second term of President of Russia to have been cast off against the Constitution after putting his second term in Putin.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken by a further, near ally putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1,35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensity Crossing with the Viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four sealaides of the "clocks" which will close the construction around one of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 shafts.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1,35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Minister of Economy Keith Brown invited the construction site today and was one of the first to come from the country on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment for the construction of the Queensland cross.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly comprehensive degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the bridge between the viaduct and the bridge deck is an heikle activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, almost 79% of the total bronce in their place and the last section of the decks gets a concrete kiss to the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to place the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first lock represents a considerable milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure of the pioneering high and deep construction represents.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last road cut and its connection with which in the expansion of the north-deck, we had to close the yet existing gap on the north or the country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern ski lift bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be withdrawn from a gradient of approximately 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">If the tolerances, on which the team works, they were tiny - on each side, they only lived a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and gree people: investors will soon be stronger than the duty in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "action concept home" to the next ratchet.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First line is the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A scheme is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">The president of the SPD parliamentary party Christoph Bratmann writes: "we are proud to build on urban areas in the future, 20 percent of all apartments in the urban areas."</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable apartments can however also arise in the stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the great controversy in the town hall is, however, so violmann: "how are you going to build with investors who want to build on private areas?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want to build investors at least 10 per cent, but as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal housing program, which will cost millions and will be financed, is supposed to take care of incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so violmann: "there are currently no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors a few regulations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Linke wants to generate hardness levels for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of how the Frying, exhort an disappearance of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">The concept concept is implemented, will ensure additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's unclear whether we get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not fully compatible: because the around 1260 new apartments should be built.</seg>
<seg id="21">How do you compare the loss of more than 1300 favorable apartments whose funding is going to be run over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020, it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, as planned as planned spokesperson Nicole Palm, you should now be able to buy-off bonds of the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought about to pick up apartments back to the price.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western town.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one stroke the problem can be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western town you can walk to the end of the year at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments can be found there, in the price of a convenient location.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this would not want to do the owners, housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">For the number of social apartments in the western town drastically increases drastically, it is removed from the goal of the so-called mixture.</seg>
<seg id="31">But a concentration of social weak in just a few parts would not give it any more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The greens therefore expect that there is movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Group president Holger Herlitschke comments: "a large majority must have the CDU with the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">I have focused on more buildings for single family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that still a compromise can be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating, how the world changed.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child do not go beyond the outside, but rather preferable to spend their leisure time on screens in the last decade of many complained.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go there is to take people of the sofa and to be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on screen was initially set to TV, then video games and most recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and activities are not connected to each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm relations with course, of course, on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that were created for video games in the 1990s (later produced a animation series, playing cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture decreased slightly ahead of the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand which overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than ink, and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players with their Smartphones are going outside and search for Pokémons, who were tracked with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (above a screenshot on the phone) or "caught."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps which the "average" person back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Therefore, a app for Apple Watch, who pursues 35,000 users, shared the Washington Post, reported that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed, who jumped 30 percent every day, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data for performance improvement.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness programmes for health, people would like to take "go for 30 minutes" to come "from the sofa" and "every day active in divers ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people that look like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the meaning of sport cannot be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drives sport, reduces his opportunities to tackle cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that can lead to it here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, that it makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to the hunting even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also merirical toys, which must always be complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it mean?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps had already been doing our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose his appeal and the use will be followed by time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of poker success it will give you more games, the apps and virtual reality with the activity will be combined into the real world, and so many people will be able to help hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is on all that immun.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the beams.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on all line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American Turnerve Festival ends on Thursday to the multi-finals and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the headlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" -team kameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal in Aliya Patafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American Simone Biles immersed in the Swedes during the single multi-finals of women during the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a majority struggle and in total the fifth, while it was their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears, when her end result was shown and its long trip took place at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success is in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, which have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles dominates the last three years, 15 world champions - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals and precision, that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton of her said that she has ever seen "the best gymnast, which I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was waiting for a final examination in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not to return with a handful gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman impoverished, after they each have won gold and silver in the single majority of the women during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal at Tuesday, while she stopped at the farewell celebration of the Team coordinator of Martha Karolyi as an exclamation mark.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even though Biles insisted on top of her long waymarks on the top, never the future is planned, isn't really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">A part of their floor exercises - which include their typical Tumbling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music, that would fit home at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and adopted by trainee Aimee Boorman's mother during a school-trip to the gymnasium, was trained into force in Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has no more competitive competition, a winning streak, which will hold as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though a pattern has easily led by two turns, the picture slipped.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pibales and soil particles - in which Biles holds the world championship title - watched.</seg>
<seg id="28">She won again with 15,433 on the Swede balks again - and with a 15,933 on the floor another one gets on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently when she anticipated her dubade - a pure formality - and tears run on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision was once described in their collection.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Raisman's performance was a vengeance for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake was painted at the model of Patafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old creams, called by the American "Oma," is a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After their ground, she reinvaded the audience of Kussheky, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes undoubtedly appeared.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I'm going to register among the Women's Youth Olympics in 2012, and that is from more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I've been with every summer Olympics in 1984 and the US was never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three gymnast, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez for inspiring many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, the Cathokin is, round off every proudly.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has set the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the past four years, the number one was under female gymnast.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gabby Douglas has rejoiced for the last Olympic Games in America and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, the world was able to be the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez to be as it was unexpected, but masterful gyback routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone the fourth, heterosexual American woman, who won gold for women with an individual event event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Man member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but so the gym is not visible throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie also smote the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it in the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympiad will have only four gymnasts in the team. Moreover, it is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainee.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks as such that Tournaments are a expensive sport and Turner at first line in private turnaround that are reckoned by parents for training, training, travel, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainer and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, Turner will receive its entire training, and this is a most expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainee of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainee of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since it began with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to wait the parishes aun countless, young girls who will be inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an excellent and easy-to-reach turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turntable by 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for more than 15,000 of urban teenagers (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained international and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will have expanded to Detroit (my hometown) to provide the youth of high-quality tourneys to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and tightness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination has lifelong benefits for health, as well as for elementary and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that thousands of young girls bring to care of interest and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic stadium and thank you how to start playing their way to begin healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="5">If you are attaching at the rear, you should turn out as first it, so that you can see your attackers and play "from the line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the gun then between your forearm and your shoulder before you beat it with your free elbow to your face.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him with the knee in the glue and turn, while the attackers joined pain together, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move, while they move the weapon to him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers, that approach itself from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the line, take the weapon and turn them away, so the attackers can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, put the weight on the weapon and beat the attackers on the chest, then turn the weapon from his handle before moving towards backward and make the weapon on it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright goes out for a guide with his tongue to the dirty places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British travel undertook his immune system and Würgereflex for a serious assessment - having found some of the dirty and most holy places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel or Ian Wright, 51, out of Suffolk will make its course on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a washing machine of access toilet and a public telephone in Russia to provide the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaving every object, it used a Luminometer to show and show us what he is going to be.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner's Strength, brought some surprising results on daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the rinsing knob of a access toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely shock-shock, but indeed you are in a kitchen molecules more poor bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, he left nothing whatever he leaked, more than a bad taste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of its bowel, looking through the world, as well as wonderful things and marvellous things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations up to rinsing crushing of toilets, the task presented his immune system Definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told us: "already as a child I was relatively unworried about what my health care and I have put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was just a reputation for his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His promo paper showed a luminometric number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In contrast, the Luminometrigs was less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refusing to refresh their Luminometrigs over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright, and the Finnish producer of dairy Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial population of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "it comes to the worst, what I did in a toilet is close."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not stoned here, because it is incaraping.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength 'was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company stroll Mr Wright with valio Gefilus that contains both Lactobacilli and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Validation Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to do something new for consumers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that's intriguing to look at and simultaneously explains the advantages of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted mad brainstormings that led to us that we said "Let us call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in the health sector is to be a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead just talk about the products, we wanted to exhibit them in a larger context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information about an interesting way and provide more information about an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the directing of the film, added: "let me tell me - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him, like the most common Russian toilet, which will be shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things, in which it was easier to bring to Ian, to check it and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty Leckeries on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a validation carried out by the year 2015, 84 per cent of all respondents of Lactobacilli are particularly associated with the wealth of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they also contain at least occasionally products which contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Treumcock were thrown out of a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative had property in a irreverable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls expelled holes on wooden panels were torn, trash was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family moved and it is believed to be living in a private accommodation now</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, which works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said that it feared that the apartment is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said, "It was an absolute nightmare here and I am the opinion that people don't need to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property will probably be viewed as a beautiful piece of Cornwalls.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is infamous and its reputation is it also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons, the temporary lived in the apartment, and the police said that the terror led the family, street struggles with baseball bats, sober-sober, drug traps, drugs and excessive cry, strings and curse.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease agreement, in June an arrangement for antishies behaviour was.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which become torn down under circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">It was razed in the estate in which the past drugs have been traded, the wooden boards were torn</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours therefore said that they looked at the streets and had to be challenged by the police</seg>
<seg id="16">In this week, Cornwall Housing delogged her and her partner this week, after they gave them a prolonged term of 11 weeks to volunteer voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Delogation were cheerated by lightened neighbours, saying that their lives was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One said, "They were not ashamed."</seg>

<seg id="20">The countless times we are saying the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"today we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet - that's not usual!</seg>

<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenants agree to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as the final step is to consider the Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">That was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extremely interesting and their deeds were terrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I guess about the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the church, who have courageous to us and have given us the information we have done.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development is consolation and provides the message that the anti-potential behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="32">There is a dirty mattress in one of the bedrooms of the house after the sogation back to the floor.</seg>

<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine penalty after having found guilty of the possession of a drug group B in the trade fair.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tomb of her son Lee Skeldon, who came in 2013 with a car accident.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives get nothing from the summer choices with - and the vacationers of North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the year 2021 the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the severity Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For it is not so far so far, it's not: summer vacation, heat and national dishes - that ends.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals that are to be convinced by the choices are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the tourists that are in the country are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are no locals, so you are not allowed to choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">Practical problems include practical problems: in the holidays are helpers that distribute the placards are inflated, flyer and at the end of the vote, only labelled.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4th, 2016, the election and last day of all day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will have to pass over for a few days over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it also goes to something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU Coalition, has to be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly visible behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting, how strong Neuling AfD will cuts and what remains of the end end of course.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign, one sees his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the land, spread roses and plauts a little with the people, as it did already be the legendary in his legendary predecessor, Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sepering has given cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gave the debt to the bloom of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, you "We are creating" to accelerate the uplifting of the rectangle, which is now thought to be priced.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its peak research, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you play at the right place for electoral campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for major agreements; Merkel's federal state is in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg-Westphalia and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," Vincent coconut, General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But there is too bad nobody to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast CDU have largely renounced the usual election conditions on market conditions and in front of the shopping malls with parasols and air balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, cocaine, plays only a "minor role."</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union has indicated that in the country it is the base that she must meet very much, again to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are like the left, the SPD, the Green Party: hardly available in the circumstances of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU campaign on its Mitiliter is also self-larvingly: "you need to go where it does, where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, any birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is on the game, Sella has now called his SPD for a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Social Democrats recently accounted for 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD gained its sharply with 35.6 percent of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The green, small party with seven percent in surveys, can leave the jump into the day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make up a modern tackling from the holiday-distress and place their campaign great on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," is the president Claudia Müller.</seg>

<seg id="2">By speed the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to treat.</seg>
<seg id="3">The construction works starting at 5.30 am in the morning and until 20 o'clock in the morning, there is allocating praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"all have been pretty cool," tells Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet gas station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superb team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was planned to be moved to the half time as scheduled to the South until the end of October all will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="8">The unloading will also be responsible for the construction works, for example, when it comes to the facility of accommodation cruises.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site on the Monday to the south, and also the rejection of the Aspergstreet in Ofterdingen was lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg is again relaxed, the traffic situation within the place is relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now sail on both sides by Ofterdingen.</seg>
<seg id="11">The expulsion through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were partly significant complaints," says the general manager of the Ministry of Transport and Deputy Head of the Deputy Head of Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The local residents of Bachel Road, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiheron had to fight with more traffic noise, because many gorges had sought and rather trusted in the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to that some people were forced to do in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because the speed limit have not been observed, the church requested the measurement vehicle from malignans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant exceeding," says King that made herself a location on the spot themselves.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are already two to three per minute blown up.</seg>
<seg id="18">The high speed was at 77 km / h in the tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">But since the construction site has been moved, it has become a quiet.</seg>
<seg id="20">For businessmen on the B 27, it's only a small comfort that is open to customers from Rottenburg for customers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people do not like to see in these cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27-rehabilitation of them has led to them in sales places, everyone, whom one asks, can look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However some more and some less are affected.</seg>

<seg id="25">Also during the autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "maximum light reduction," but also one of course, "it is missing."</seg>

<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, former crown, finds distinct words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only it, but all the cars made it "hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">It lacked the customers of hechingen, Balingen and Rota rope.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro sales.</seg>
<seg id="32">It aims at "far above 50 percent."</seg>
<seg id="33">The road building has been thrown by two years. "</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his employees have to let go away.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released, the policy would have responded different.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt responding to a request by Göhner whether there would be a financial balance, otherwise, the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the position on the B 27. now they also let the disadvantages that surrender to the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where there was a bit more spacious.</seg>
<seg id="38">Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to pass.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the history of history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other guests can now understand less frequently due to the complicated traffic light, but can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive it, it is very different.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his ancestor descends back to the end of the rehabilitation work, Göhner has no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises of BSE with BSE and birds, Göhner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the greatest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long history.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the name of the terror control the terror attacks will be screwed into law.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now a thick safety package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a terror status with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the Koalitioner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière is the Reconciler.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are politically unmistakable, "says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the Presentation of his new security package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They require no request.</seg>
<seg id="8">Others, further points would be discussed initially within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I also involved with me too.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the Minister of Interior, however, is its results from him and in a "recoverable consensus" within the Coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Maizière was given a little time after the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, before he presents his conclusions for the security in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has already been announced, announced that a new safety authority to take care of the baked communication is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications on flight information and arms law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities are also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière starts a second attempt for suggestions that do not have been doing so far for the SPD: he wants to establish sympathy for terror groups and jihadists with double citizenship about the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"this will be more difficult points for the SPD," which the CDU-man is a dreamer.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, he still hold it for a reasonable and challenging, even what odds calculating in the coalition partner.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas showcases de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in itself: it is planning fast-procedure for deportation orders and more possibilities for collecting people in front of deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who have been brought to the country are to reveal their smartphone in advance, and the social media account for a security check in advance.</seg>
<seg id="22">With Dulce for the eldest asylum seekers, he wants to have some worse than now - such such that offences go away or to throw away their papers to swallow up their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">A lot of them is politically and legally marriage.</seg>
<seg id="24">Manse works even unbalanced and leaves asking questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of facts, for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, say de Maizière, it's important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be expressed in the speech that the assassination of Ansbach and Wuerzburg clans were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are also many people in view of the high refugee's worries about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that caresses the people, let not even be clamped into electoral struggle times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is enormous in focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First attack in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The backup is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are choices.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD lead to the subject of internal security increasingly in position.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past days, the two parties passed away.</seg>
<seg id="37">A garniger dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some global ministers, in which the Ressortchefs is also calling for a return of double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière also labors here with conciliatory notes.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a return from the double compass, he stop nothing.</seg>
<seg id="40">We meet the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">They are remarked, be not useful.</seg>
<seg id="42">And with a burka prohibition he had a constitutional objections.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package at all corners is unconstitutional and whether it is "reasonable" for the coalition partner, it must still show itself.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot in what to fight for war.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also attempting to profiling with the subject of inner safety.</seg>
<seg id="46">Partner Sigmar Gabriel is signalized only to talk talk time and says: "the SPD is ready to talk about everything that will help ensure safety."</seg>

<seg id="6">Europe's largest highways can see further plus in the previous year despite its many brands and some well run markets.</seg>

<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, shipments accounted for almost one hexagon.</seg>

<seg id="12">In addition, there are also some core markets in some core markets by changing economic conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU, explained a speech.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, where the emission affair first escalated, also stands on a minus.</seg>
<seg id="15">Large support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overall, the primarily affected house brand of Lower Saxony was further increased by diesel engines: after the first seven months, only an extradition minus of 0.9 percent to 3,37 million vehicles is available.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales of Fred Kappler could continue to refer to an increase in sale from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen in this period delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated with a software certificate.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling for some 2.5 million cars to rearmament into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of retrofitting, VW showed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the rearmament of vehicles, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor power was no deterioration.</seg>
<seg id="23">The car's car is entitled to a "guarantee" certificate, but he didn't talk of a "guarantee" as it was called on Friday in its company.</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason for legal essments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Focus" had reported that Volkswagen preserves his German clients now a guarantee for all diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This had confirmed this last Monday VW-representatives at the Federal Ministry of Office.</seg>
<seg id="27">It was confirmed by the Ministry of Health, that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW has agreed to fully comply with the stipulations of my investigating commission and KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">"derogations are not accepted," stated Federal Minister of Office Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has taken the warranty that in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor power after rearmament, and all of the approved vehicle values will remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen even uses the term "guarantee" but not how it was in business circuits.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "guarantee" provides Volkswagen the possibility for example a half a year after conversion about with a motor damage to a workshop - and that could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also in the customer's interest it is important to avoid that it occurs in etaione other damage, that did not do anything with the Abgasskandal, too, with regard to potential warranty claims, as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, use the term "guarantee" to the VW 'guarantee.</seg>

<seg id="3">Before you are talking to the comment part, in order to excite him under the pseudonym non-alarms defect of men with rough chances, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multiple deliverance of sound boards does not want to be welcomed to a boom in millennials, due to the realignment of physical objects, but on the Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have bought a record recently have been foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer of the buyer.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers reserve their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone for spend (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But does the results of YouGov do?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would have a news report on TV would follow me, while I carry the camera in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit, wear and wild, before I stop, keep my hands and some sort of immensely like: "so let's throw us a closer look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's throw a look at.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of SoHos goes slowly over to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where you were once independent sellers - there are as a handful of fantastic turntables.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind controlled by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I of Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three men middle age) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight men middle ages, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collectors, question I?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">This sound records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed after the house), changing the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he owns a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford, when they had appeared and sold all objects when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought to buy something too young to buy it," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who buy plates, more and gladly spend time alone, and adds: "I smoke not and I drink not much."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, which works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets the YouGov profile is true.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people that have influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback to buy again their old plates.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the discussions that I have led, people are usually deprived around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom on supporters of the panel of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like phonica to realize that the panel stores a soothing community of equal tinns.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers hit the contact with the non-contact payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans are overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to return to the stability of confidentials, from objects, cheerful events.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or the ownership of material possessions than a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That's in me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to employ spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" soldered a staff from a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people have bought a record, they did not yet have heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player that they never use it, while 7% of those who buy a plate, have no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that point of the message I would probably look very concerned, while I blamed through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who has been working at sounds of the Universe (number of data: three men middle age) has noticed a "trophy" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone recently returned here and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead Schallplatte, so I would like to put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it happens definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive-consuming, less musiclastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, which are only slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has an blower audience when I walk.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists that make photos, teenagers and women average age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts of the latest Synthesis and Expert Pop instead of experimental jazz drens from the speakers - is it good to see such diversity in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">No one of them seeth lonely, but nagious psychmata are hard to be fixed when you stand apart from someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running on business for a few minutes and considers the variation of the disks available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It looks more like a shovemmel as a large one.</seg>
<seg id="50">She deserves not much, therefore the collecting of records is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It cost much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other way to hear, but the beauty of slabs is... "they drives with a pleasant sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business which is said that a new generation of record lovers will have to be inspired by Urban Outjams.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the ticket to samples the jeans-Hotpants, I watch one group of young teenagers who occupy a group of Polaroid cameras before a father and daughter is superior to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics which is essential for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are only pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to handle it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items would like to mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about itself.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov agree that the Great number of female collectors in Soho, the large number of female collectors and turntables exist in reality, top shops and online tours are inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not strolling through Plumbles by record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through Plain, while holding the starving look of an unfurious, 30-year-old false talent, which rises nothing of elderly men aged over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">French court rejected an offer by authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live, settled in thousands of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="3">In case of a court hearing this week argued the authorities in Calais that the state should have jurisdiction to rip 72 Provisional Business, in which persons sell goods or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy would be paid out of which no tax would be paid and those of fire and sanction cruises.</seg>
<seg id="5">In humanitarian groups, with the court found that the business and restaurants are important, as the free meals that were offered by the state-supported association and other groups, not sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that the Provisional Business and restaurants often offered accommodations and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate 72 Provisional Business, but dreamed that the concerns of Calais "prefecture are absolutely trackable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role, live as people who live in extremely bounties. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas have tranquil meeting between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des Camp, which is a non-profit-profit and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as an advice about asylum procedures for hundreds of protection requirements, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids's café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it was stated that the closure "was charged for this children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest is eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two charity organization Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrants has estimated that the number of people in the jungle-camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after an steep rise of newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive great Britain in the 7-seater Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening on an abrupt stop at the last hurdle, when they were defeated with a result of 43-7 in Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in handling, side quping, reverse circulation, liner running and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic Games in any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was sunk by the not too bad trostine of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth in that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day might fall back in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, in this form, Fiji hadn't put a 15-man team in the form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a comfort for GB - but it probably will probably be - that at least a Brite will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former chef for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult road behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost under Ryan every game on Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">They lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This slipping will pact, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji also wonderfully and caused the attacks of GBS from hatred.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt at captain Tom Mitchell and Co. an, when you were running in driving buses. the World Series winner went up 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau spent in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">At still four minutes of play Jerry Tuwai left another attack from the right corner, which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are 12-0 and GB hard to get the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A strong Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa a third goal but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua had a touch down and there stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new year since the resumption of the Nakarawa, and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou are prefake by further weak tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion had a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is such that Fiji were born to have been born to play 7, while UK still remit.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led fundamental changes to the half time through and completed the fijiagic gap... for a full four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half time, to Joshua Tuisova ran through a Brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for a long time in favour of the south exposure, the fans bends, and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the Polish approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i-tittle with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pfiff-rays, the Fijis embraced, and the GB were exhorted to the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan's semi-final with 20-5 and the UK pushed South Africa into a crisp match from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Bok in the first half of the front, but Dan Norton took the line with an impressive footwork and achieved a gate under the position in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling from Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the British 15-Aside teams, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the cancer of trainers to rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotional gold as with these games and that wants what will be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stop until the last, 220 hard Hieve, that enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting on the harbour, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams was always present at the second Olympiagold in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports, which laid such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their Dominance was absolutely, all of her 39,th unleaking use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes, that slides over the surface with elegance of swings, which is not reflected in the way of the Triumphal Arch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in ruins, a Bataillon is helping to contribute to the incremental progress, which make the difference, and there was no more hilly than the coach who would not survive one day at all, when he was diagnosed with cancer at all.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he riseth what risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, who is operable and doing it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, he spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Trio was fortunate that he could be the treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, could begin the interruption to a minimum, if this is the correct term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was a incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is already a challenge, but this makes it even greater.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who had a nervous morning, thus spent a little bit more than anything else to handle its own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wanning, the centurion at the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's maybe something extremely, but it means as much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated just how much as I and Helen and I have also been working at this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would not have a massive thanks to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would not have any better person for trainers or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even during the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to suspend, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to take a tear off.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">Today we wanted no fireworks, we wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a break off for a year before making decisions concerning the future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now they just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Managing Director of the "Veitful group" group, Ruppert Göller, is retiring.</seg>
<seg id="3">The association is considered "Bavarian broadly exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="4">A small fresh drinking water assembly as model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">So there was some time ago in a post-old originator in a post of Bayerischer Rundfunk.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little later, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken was accused of the purposes of the purposes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The work of the eitful group is "Bavarian broadly" as exemplary. "</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who had a permanent staff of 31 years, had been as managing director for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water association of the operating group with headquarters in Kottendorf, Municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 locations and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Affiliates are the churches of Kirchloud, Breitbrunn, Lauder, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">For further towns and communities, there are water supply agreements.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was set in 1985 as a watcher, and was named as Managing Director of the Zweckfederation in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks are very manifold and they extended from waste management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities, the budget of preparation, limestone of charges and contributions to emergencies on weekends," said the chairwoman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an exceptional events called it the commissioning and inauguration of the new well (1994), property sales in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of farmers, the redevelopment of a central computer controller (2004), and the reorganisation of a central computer controller (2004).</seg>
<seg id="16">I have given no nursing, and I have always taken new features, because Water lives and potable water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In their Laudatio they praised Gölls, reliable and correct service over the 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has been used with plenty of heart blood for its purpose-purpose and has lived on a watcher, as if it had his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, he had to present the success concept of the leadership group for Nitrates before the water forum of the Unterfranken's water forum.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has received very much recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller also praised the watcher, Alfons Griebel, who worked together for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best swart for water and he was a faithful man.</seg>

<seg id="8">Through the regular merit, Seniors may establish social contacts and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">For frequently, social and family structures appear at the age, a chorus is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made known Ursel Kipp in her chorus: "to talk and organize on the other, to learn and learn one another - a choir is a very special form of compositions."</seg>
<seg id="11">Sing in the positive sense in the positive sense, believes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since there is a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly calls his lungs are not so fast in the daily life.</seg>

<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, do not just practise yourself on itself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that you departs by singing in the choir, believes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is growing by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Themselves to show yourself: if I'm long for something, I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to begin with Singen, so there's enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone wishing to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he believes, little talent will have.</seg>
<seg id="28">We will not be singing only - with 50 singing people, who listens to me when times a tone goes to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, seniors offers different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Anyone sings from the acquaintance circle in a Senior Merchicor, you can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in a church choir can turn right to the congregation or church of the church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior intelligence companies can also be found on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whoever does not have access to internet, you can request the family, friends or neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="35">The desire to sing, shouting to be sure to join a choir, beatt Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing the soul well and has something of the liberation - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="8">When this week some users struck a filter with a filter which gave them slums, false teeth, and inputty pliers, there were some critics known as a racial caricature of Asians - "yellowds."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked if these repeated controversy was found on a larger problem that the company has verseness with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat review that it would have been disabled.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was thought to be a homage to anime characters and not as cartoon by Asians.</seg>

<seg id="2">Military members of the United States Central Command changed dramatically further information to define a more optimistic picture of war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it had allowed the actual states on site in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces, Committee of Committees and the Wehrbudgeth, reported by a great dissatisfaction under Central Command Intelligence Command and reported to change their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"news service information, which typically have been reviewed by high-level CentCom Commander, assaulted a picture by the American efforts towards terrorism than it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analysis of other news services," quoted a newspaper article published.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is inacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders," he introduced Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The CentCom government errors range from the top of the organization until the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 10-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct indications that government points have given orders to change reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure from their prelaws, also known as ISIS or Isil.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, comments and statements made clearly positive before the Congress," presented the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, CentCom ruled that a military reconquest of the Mossultry could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, continues under control of Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after the months of investigations, it is so far" clear. "Mike Pompeo, republican Congress held from Kansas, discussed in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of the year 2015, the tips of Central Command summed up the follow-up reports to play the danger through ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republicans called the Task Force on Life after giving them that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings, during the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Additional investigations of CentCom reports are in addition to the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence in Gange.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, the members of the news service Committee published on Thursday their own findings, with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom formed an overly limited process for the creation of subsequent service assessments to Isil and the Iraqi Security Service," which was a member of the Representative House Adam B. Ship, known in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, as Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of recent reports," the Moral under Analysts and, "there was a little space for different opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. ship and Democrats stated to have found no evidence on a ripening of the White House at CentCom analysts at a "particular political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress was published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times of investigations reported by the Pentagon's general spectacle, which were recorded according to CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press secretary of the Pentagon, was in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would report no reports of the Congress during the investigation of the General Inspectacle.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have recognised opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of this important topics of the national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations having regard to the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement that has been made by increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year, however, the question dropped to the extent, President Obama can rely on Central Command for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the pathological data is reminiscent of more than ten years ago as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, a font on the recommendations of many analysts, only a small occupying troops in Iraq looked after the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker on government agencies that met contrary to government proposals against the financial situation of the terrorist group as they had taken into operation in order to sell the oil on the black market.</seg>

<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey team in hands (her two older sisters played the Sport in the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">It missed the 2008 Olympiad in 2008 because they couldn't qualify for the loader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then, in 2012, the year 2012 was going to shoot everything to her and team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn the things to better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, mental change, and physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the work spensing in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can completely tear it completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the cake batches on the first half of the game with a return ticket from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game level from 1-0 through to the third quarter, until Bam the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It performed a sprint with the shallow ball over the left flank, then moved to the ball in the middle and lupbeat the ball to the US a 2-0 guide.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez opened the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the tournament for the Torkeepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a goal in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well it will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, even as late it is, the Olympic Games are too late.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly growing and unusual, a roaring seasons between competition and streaks.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, when the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which will protect from the wristwatches to swim to the race for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't listen to the tv, read a newspaper or listen to the queue in the Coffeshop, without informing Simone Biles, Katie Discovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of 10 with dimples, could have been completely sent among these known names, which would be sent to Prime Time, including sponsors and well-being-TV advertising, when he had a swimmers, Turner, or even freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, out of Lake Forest, California, fighting for gold in the Olympic Gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event like this.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade there are the sports, which are not generally accepted: airpistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always swim the breast and get it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when I do like a modest arguments for my particular favourite, then let me get the attention on the discreet charm of the tramp.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trolini skip already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years so annoying that many people I asked, did not know that it is at all an Olympiasportart.</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional Ignorms.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even though the USA sent athletes competing for competition, it has never won a medal in trampolines and had a athlete up until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who divide the women for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trolini skip has a certain exterior, partly because it sounds for the unexplained ears for a clownsschool as those sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a feasting enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the sweet trembling of its never swollen eyelids - but also the Grazie of the Turnens and Dives, the two sports, which are essentially unifies.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means a lot of "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victins jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet across the air and need to land a number of attacking motions (turning, hreal and Saltos) before they reach the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympics, you will be evaluated according to the official programme of difficulty, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-man-standing athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women are coming to compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their streaks to Gold, faster, upward, and go back, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and down, and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They chase not only the finish line or the output wall, but in the TV broadcast another goal: the world or the Olympic record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal oriented approach is Nobel, admired, even fanatic, and it's enough to stir up an audience to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I have to look at this games as a bit tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the ololini head is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prepped, seeming heavily missilos like a astronaut, then immediately after, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreams of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen can only be the competition during the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final round of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming at 1.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will decorate the Endro as part of an afternoon blocks on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who will probably overlook in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase was only achieved by the attacking and the objection of male athletes, as it recently proposed the male US Turner at the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="3">Demonstrators that demand political changes in Ethiopia are struggled for violent resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that however divorced during clashes with the police have been killed in Schussers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight going wrong?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid line of West Africa with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months, protests against the government were the country and fared in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed on the streets and desired fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's answer was uncomputed according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen killing them killed and killed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, facts about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security professionals beat young people with sticks, while these were forced to make a handict against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now demands a further investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa," said Rashid Abdi, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated from the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services collaborate closely with the Cans to fight terror in the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded in a considerable tempo.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new item in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to implement the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were effective in silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or to the prison, or aborted in the wake of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and these have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protesters.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protesters.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use up to the sausage in relation to power of the rainy coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a recent elections last year, the Governing party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time stresses along the border with Eritrea; a battle for these zag, controversial line called hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fears that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were forced to take more or less, the turbulence, and could be armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of provocation after years in the surface becomes explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have more frequent and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government turns access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, so many people still communicate over internet Proxies that conceal where they are going to stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered themselves together to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they prospered, Amharas, who come from branches of predominantly Christian upside, in politics and economy, while they took from the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and living in flat areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a screen," Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray that account for around 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, in the services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason to rest is the death of Meles Zenadawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death in a non-public disease in 2012, 17 years from Ethiopia, Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that he was particularly compensated in, early signs of dissatisfaction and special issues to edit opponent and to make them damaging.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing on this fundamental in the Dick," said Mr. Abdi, an conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Cush, a new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">In other words, Mr. Meles, who came from the tiger in northern Ethiopia, comes Mr. Hailemariam from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he did not enjoy the trust of the security services rendered by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had an inuproar in Ethiopia in 2005, after thousands against elections were apparently carried out by the government themselves and then were stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razcids many protesters have been killed, even if it were less than in the last months and this time of the disturbances went relatively rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts, Cush leader for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendlership, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this does not have the intensification of internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnical shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month divorced in Gondar, an amharan town, used by Tigray, and the hatred on the tiger is always common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that protests are the United States and other Western allies in an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if they were recently closed that she has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy over the West, he will not want to strive together with the seatile area in a already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said "Abdi," is a very thin hike. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains the Obama's claim to ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy on Friday the last controversy that his campaign being surrounded by his efforts, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terror group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">These clarification designed new questions on communication skills in the Republicans of Republicans whether he is able to communicate clear and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his Mitiliter that endeavour to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to declare in the gradecent position, which he could not be meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he made the clarification at a election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rendered a statement regarding the claim on Thursday and insisted that he did not intend to recruit the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning, Mr. Trump said, he is simple, neutered.</seg>
<seg id="7">In contrast to the previous day, Mr. Trump said to a number of interviews, he said that the excuses spake completely to me.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to quintend the statement something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, wanted to know the Republican Presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of critique on Mr. Trump is down, while he tries to get the focus of its campaign because of expiration results in the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return this topic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Via Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinics would lead to higher taxes and found trying to boring its speech.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July, he moved to himself strong critique when he said that Russians should give Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but later, "Of course I thought that"</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the speeches limits to postpone and then to rudes as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his ways to test how to get certain messages from his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," says Ruth Sherman, a communication lab which the language of both candidates were observed.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of deciding the sound for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has taken a closer sound, since its polls have passed further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new poll of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a large margin in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally tried to apologize for his provocal statements, he charged his critics frequently to suspicious his statements or untrue.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he intensified in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze chose his loyal co-stripe in the uncomfortable situation to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may also be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, and one of Trumps, prominent intercession, continued to defend the candidates today in an CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani said it to the correctness of Mr. Trumps, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had formed the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that Obama called ISIS an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, entirely wrong and so it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream republicans try to arguing that the government served as an external Minister, it allowed ISIS to spread themselves to expand the situation in the Middle East to control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Prior to the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, and did overthrew himself, on each of his words, and preoccupied with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He stranded the "poor," eunful "TV experts who try to understand and said," They don't know! "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trumps excuse as merely a further evidence that he is unfit for the presidential address.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As Feinschmecker, President Roosevelt is a Faible for refined Delicatessen to Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de Foie gras and Maryland waterplates.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its menu on that day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a paving pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with sleighing people," Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "There was also a message to the Americans, as they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both Food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "CHOP Suey" traded out of the Chinese cuisine in the United States, during drawing in their book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her newest collaboration, "A permanent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrated the history of the American kitchen during the great depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity, when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, grakellous snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brickman, 54, ordered a glass cheese with olive trees, whilst coe, 57, turkey with potato purée and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the Minter Hackney ordered, this was the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular" said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared out of a ingredient and a little less than the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine, so many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as a dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">COE grind.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must be like lead in the stomach as lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, mainly in rural areas, an all-You Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women boiling for male athletes and it was served fresh pasted pasted for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">There were the Americans that sent during the first World War food to hungry Europeans. "A Square Meal" records the paths where the country went to land no longer.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time in the food for the Americans a central, sharpened theme," how did Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">The new Budgetary was the same as the new Budgetary: mysterious dishes such as loaves and casserole dish, the casserole, as "wonderful species, Essentireya recompensed," noted gypsum, because the precious food could hide under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drying.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat that was at the heart of the American kitchen for many years, became a very rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tried, since a calorie-rich and nourished satisfaction had to tasted before taste or even healthy kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="27">During their research on the book which also comprises recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular supplement for lunch," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions don't fit in one another.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, household economy - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923-1943 - the eating habits of the country.</seg>
<seg id="33">By making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encourages women to become "domestic spectives" and the challenge, ping as creamy spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical leakage group.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports of the government's response to the hungry citizens, as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-me-Cake-attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmers in the kitchen of his kitchen, he has grown as the million strong man from the world to which he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cooking like fish with Gurkensauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in a close-up meal and put a tuxtually.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was delightful to realise.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt could have committed the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor would have asked him to stroll with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the drains of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs. Roosevelt, that the White House produced the most long-time food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food, was rejected once the country came back on the legs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest spine is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland is usually only in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swim with a 1 km / hour by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mixed swimming pool on the ground of the North Atlantic is located on average, in an hour, on average, it is only 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes on, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and it's top speed as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle seems to be a reflection concept for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues tell the journal "Science" in any case of a Greenland, 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"mad", commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life expectancy, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist believed that Greenland is long ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence is missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland is difficult to observe, finally, they live mainly in the Eismeer mainly in the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer to water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">More than the lifestyle of the Greenland's lifestyle is correspondingly less.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time-up emptied them, having equivaled six animals with a transmitter in front of the Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless this sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed up the pine bones of a young ice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly hunt them sleeping animals or patrol on the basis of the ice mear and look for Kadesh, which are from higher water layers according to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimeter measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of sharks with carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens has been created before the birth of the sharks, which contained in the form of the proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens-core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie down after the early 1960s than nuclear weapons attempts to drag larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In which, with 220 centimetres of length, the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapon, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major species of Greenland, normal carbon-14 quantities had been produced by cosmic ray in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14 Clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetres long Greenland, while the record shark should be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That the females still get offspring after the Greenland, when they are longer than four meters, was well known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers examined the length of an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters will probably be determined on the threshold for the sexually mature and its age with 156 years, Greenland's growth is obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This also could be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such Methusaleme live primarily in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the old record holder, a 211-year old Greenland, was caught on Alaska with a 120-year-old harpoon head, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals remain on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then they cross it later - and let it slow down.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface due to the animal in heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on it as soon as possible as many offspring," says the Evolutionist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">In contrast, a very big animal should actually invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy. he made the legend proud of having crossed home to home a victory of Favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking win four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic oldmedals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick, after being held in March at the railway world championships in London despite the backfeeding Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as an execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that tried Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man where they stayed when she saw potential in the villi, who now unfold it now.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hiny, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy ducks - and Skinner in the qualification round a Olympic champion, but in the position round the New Zealand's stills in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Behind his round it was barely back, but Kenny brought the team back to the front and Skinner.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a large part of transformation from where Hindes in a higher gear took to slow down and it's Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as BBC expert from and fell Skinner, Kenny and hinder when they rose to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a tasty comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm only here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the Endrone Olympiad, we set up an Olympic champion and defeats the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, there was a weak start confidently onto the railway.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this saying later and there was no appeal to England.</seg>
<seg id="22">For such an outstanding victory there was no such issue this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said, "It feels like London's all GB flags on the grandstand as London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We are so bad at so many world titles so that it was incredibly to win again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, the seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If a barometer of our progress has been in the last five months, we expect to expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny it is possible in the realm of Possible, that he is winning Hoys winning three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a apparently most holy date for the British sport). Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born.</seg>
<seg id="30">The cheque of Hoy equals.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which today begins and going for over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoys this just for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">It can win with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels something to win alone, alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medallists of the day but there was more good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Brady Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doubs qualified up with the fastest power in the four-four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">The World Record, who won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be staged on the second day of the contest, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had fought against the qualification round before the qualification when they called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the same women's competition, continuing and finish, avanced Laura Despate, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald at world record time in 4: 13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is leaving at his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a band of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to a truly exceptional representation of absolute Dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There were drama in the background, so the resignation of the Technical Director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and Mobbingprefers and the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, when you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite then that the legendary reputation GBS, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminum melts of Portland in Victoria and hundreds of workstations - are available at the game because the system operator will terminate the energy supply contract, which will resolve all supply contracts, such as the supplier of energy companies.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria early this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A payout for 20 years is running in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the corner of Alcoa in Portland are available on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 work stations -direct or indirect - may be endangered at any time.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to Dominoas, since the melting plant is around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa completed the Point Henry melt, which led last year on a closing of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risked a closing time.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of developing speculations in regards to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the powerful Australian dollar and lastly due to the current price of the system.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium shells with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, reported that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is located in the majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japan Marubeni Corp are holding smaller proportions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to be operated in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by using the melt," divided the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL still said that the treaties-called "backup transactions," which should be in force starting in November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The treaties have a 12 month period of notice that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"hence, AGL of them goes out that the contracts for the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenues," said the supply of the supply.</seg>
<seg id="17">All of the potential impact on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong schedule prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL shared with the value of contracts already written in his annual financial statements of $187 million in "waiting for a cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa told that the decision to book the Treaties, the 'ability Alcoas... to operate the melt or the power supply to the melt' do not impaired.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010, it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have come into effect from November this year, even if there is still a statement, why it has returned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysis of analyst due to the bad economic conditions of the sector in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of the Analyst beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually produces about 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both plants should disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [power market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as generating sets this is not good, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Eldashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder is and running at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on its Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room of full people I love, brought me the sight of this covers to wines," wrote Kendall.</seg>
<seg id="5">The disclosure of the Covers followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Cardashian), which ends the entire Cardashian-Jenner's family (with the exception of the problem of biz-Onkels and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seaccreas): they are all planned with a classic delights: they all have a surprises planned.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the klischeezed act of a children's birthday (Seaccrest resulted in the proposition, "You did believe that we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a animation at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to take part their other girls somehow to the Publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With a view to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians began.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendalls big sister Kim likes them, what the Vogue Cover is defeated (she and her husband Kanye West were to see in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Septemberedition is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a volume which is rather similar to a fashion magazine than a fashion magazine resembles the output a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were 615 pages on advertising).</seg>

<seg id="15">But even at the low probability that Mrs Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "dipping model" of their generation - is located in a good company, in a good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people, or reality Stars or young people from today that know how to shoot a good snapshot video (even if everything is directed to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had been one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners do not like success.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenner's position was quite anxious in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleagues in Gigi Hadid and called them "the mistress of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">The feelings of boiling back high, when the message came with the appearing Jenner on the Vogue Cover.</seg>

<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="5">And this will be reached again by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we are awarding 10,000 new apprentices to create 40,000 new jobs and a youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as they were ahead in London in 2012, there will be such that the challenge of enlargement Heathrow is too large.</seg>
<seg id="8">I have told me that England will never be ready for the games and we will play on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two flyers had wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to vanishing, but Heathrow answers every question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for a infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">An option is an option to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in witty growth, and a legacy of skills and employment for the international airport to be left as well as in the whole of the GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has been implemented a £11 billion expensive investment program in time and budget, from T5 - the five year in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two frequencies of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to provide a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the enlargement of Heathrow is also to be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time that we turn this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow and create our future trading and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of England.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was inhabited according to the projections of a new NASA climate model probably instantly habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NASA developed a model to discover the past of the Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that similar to climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once have been recorded with its hot, water-loose surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously stated that the slow revolution of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, ersimilar atmosphere, and still turned slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model illuminated by the early Venus as well.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed out more dry places than the Earth, but had once enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect life before rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS-Modellsimulation, the long revolution of the Venus continued its daily turn of the sun for nearly two months", GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio declared in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warmed the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which looks like a rain umbrella to prevent the surface of a large majority of sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus which resembles the evolution that previously believed by Planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although they were likely to be habitable, the Venus' was exposed over much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burnt down from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen was discharged only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus, which we know them today.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the Kepler Welding telescope, astronomers have helped to collect the complete catalog of rotational rates among the stars of the star of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data will help to understand the astronomer, why stars in star careers are rotating at different rates as well as in which respect the rotational space with the planetary observations.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through the comparisons of our results with other starters, learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 lightyears away from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster, created around 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now fastest on the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">These grieving stars get out of these gripping stars out of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the winch has come through the stars of the stars, they have a brake effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">If a star affects, its rotational rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotational rate of any death by pressing the time between the appearance of a recognizable constellation -- as sun spot -- recognize.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalogue of rotational rates indicate that more massive star can spin more than a less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars slower pirouters than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors entend to be massive, some faster rotors that tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmer of release-malware infection currently has targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware infection specialists, Malwarebytes is less than 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany over 40 percent of surveyed companies in the last twelve months have at least once, partly several times of an attack with express software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a Ransomware market.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of victims paid attention to the perpetrators required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their express software according to the observations by Malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Are they successful there, the potentially compressible lion money falls clearly higher than in private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we look at" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" Malwark chef Marcin Kleczynski talks with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most painters programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the perpetrator software for himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, private use was the goal, but the transition to the company's neck was shockingly fast in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware is working according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, she seeked specifically for unaltered files like e.g. Word-, Excel- or database files as well as in archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Next, the software announces the requirements of the narpresser.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to the files you need to transfer the victim's money - usually in the form of crash lens Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private use is the personal photo database on the game, it is customised for companies by sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage should be taken if a Ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent had to be completely subdued, in case of a case people were in Fatal.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened with the loss of patient's health.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims," it is not only paying the issue, "says Krichzynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay to get their data.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, safety forresearchers from F-Secure examines the payload areas and contact us to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to form a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain its victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin to pay free access websites or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And are saved privaters to payments of a few hundred euro, companies must pay part hard beat and five digit sums to withdraw their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potential high and relatively risky winnings from the Ransomware market, hacker will always share professional and share the work, explains security professionals from the Internet-provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware circa within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that there are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software architecture to the actual express.</seg>
<seg id="30">The new malware kits produced by introducing the malware, advising and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of supply is an adaptable tool, so that smaller configuration, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The release is then looking for a further hacker to spread the newly introduced software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one lodges in one of the forums in the underground, buying the set from a criminals and for another one to install the software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made by per classifiable calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then apply to the dissemination," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Malagebytes survey trust in order to be able to collect Ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanners.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators will pursue new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators, with the publication of sensitive data, such as customer soloists or price reductions," explains Malnotebytes-boss Marcin Krichzynski.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the little HR-V Honda wants to unpack everything: a little SUV, a little Coupé and also the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds quite excuploaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, was actually extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear. no spot works closely at any spot.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the indoor space are well-processed and work comfortable, only the cockpit of the cockpit is something wrong.</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile than comparable vehicles is HR-V at the storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not just a trunk storage of 453 l at high and 1026 l when folded back-rests but it gives the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical, than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be up as chin-up and offer the storage room which is high up to the ceilings 1,24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot space can be loaded well, however, the loading height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">With an output of 88 kW / 120 hp, the tested 1.6-liter diesel engine accelerates the HR-V with a torque range of up to 300 Nm.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is likely to create a lot of quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another engine is available: a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering is likely to be a bit of direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment is in the tested Top version, "Executive" no wishes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The City emergency braking assistant belongs to the security systems (works up to 32), the collisions system and the trace assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warn irrents sometimes because he has rated many obstacles as "herannahende objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote device works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic sign recognition and throttle when necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, the full connectivity is only available for the top configuration: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App Integration and More.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and a HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore something arable to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel engines are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest so much, the gasoline model will receive 20,000 euros, the diesel will receive more than 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday-looking car.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening one roll around for evermore, at night you will walk far from sleep in the morning, in the morning, much more to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's all others as a relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep insomnia and more than ten percent, find their sleep frequently or not a permanent.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbance, and there may be many causes of causes underlying, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, Steering Committee of the German Society for Sleeves and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What we understands among them is, but the Insomnie, so is an input and sleeping-like.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just this, many people go out as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknicht, Member of the board of the German household association with practice in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Organic, psychic or dialogy-related factors, but also medications are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the disturbing expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking up is especially recommended by depression." says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors need to one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Anyone who has a herniated disc, can lie bad, watches all two to three hours and starts to gree about everyday problems and sawling, there is Weeß one example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is not possible anymore.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should you sleep with insomnia to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who don't sleep over a period of a month in at least three nights per week and should be impaired on the day should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look completely different: one is abrouted, tired, tired, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has swelling fluctuations or physical complaints like stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the disorder, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, inter-behavioural changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also medications - classic sleep tablet is only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks - inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany it is hardly noticeable in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fixes, head of the interdisciplinary or medical centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">The case, that is why you should contact with sleeping difficulties at first time, at a weavant Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the investigation in the sleep laboratory, Healer for example, with breathing difficulties, for example with breathing difficulties, if sleeping, or if you do not find the cause of a passage in sleep.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"but please make no nowhere," says Fibre.</seg>
<seg id="30">After graduation, one gets to his normal time into the bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beside the electrodes the body is wearing a nose goggles, a chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera will feature the blanket over the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected the problems get in the grip?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of positions in which you can set up for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular insens- and rise times, not to sleep in the bed, not to sleep in the day, not watching television to sleep, alcohol, and at night not begin at the clock - then it begins to count immediately, and that's all at all.</seg>

<seg id="6">Ground is the house with the number 94: once it was busy, the residents acquired rental contracts, but the ground floor are still occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin inner city of Berlin has several times, since the beginning of the year, the police against the project decidedly called "no-go Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms were cleared on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were cleared, according to 30 to 40 civil servants and three teamwork on site, locked parts of the road and last visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers changed the premises on behalf of the unknown house owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration court decided that the dozer was illegal, and one day later, police and building worker went under the Jubel of sympathizers and people.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this summer afternoon the road peacefully: parents are going to walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are entertained Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the hood projects, primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left force is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives since 1999 in the Kiez, and Jana *, which is here three children, are mainly from the police station.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the skin objects, they share the concern and genetic engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">It sounds not after a pinez that surrounds the majority of polishing from the vandalding left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, the Berlin inside and the police between squash and their neighbors, does not exist so far.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin actually was a traditional working class, which also has a lower average in comparison to the rest of the city and has high poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also squatters and the newborn housing projects are already long to the pines: in 1990, numerous houses in former GDR were occupied, among them almost the entire mainz street, close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been vacated under a regular road battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigs and are partly inhabited by people, which they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly becoming a magnets for tourists and electoral liners from all over the world: with them, residents of GDR-times and former house cultivated in their pine trees.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in rentals, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings on the rigs are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them in raised disks or freshly coated facades, which were dued with paint clothes.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned as often along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbors who see as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: offences such as body violating is that nearly exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most important part of the offender make non-damage reasons, which tend to meet the newly built buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives since 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, uncertainty may not be a speech.</seg>
<seg id="27">What undergoes, it is serious: people in the 94 are their neighbours, which they have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars also give it no more to the rigs in front of the rigs.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied Architecin, her street is no criminal burning point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than what else."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigater Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore, it was so important that the local residents get their streets: from the police, the policy and the media that claimed to claim the Deutory conditions suddenly in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, in the eyes of the residents of the inhabitants, the road continues to be taken away: by mirabless new buildings in former building gaps, that would push the old inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="37">For conciliation, who likes over paint bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer, has no understanding: the hood and the left scene belonged to the pines.</seg>

<seg id="24">De facto finds no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not working so far to have been presented on private apartments so Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, General Apartments must be contracted, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">A new container will be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine client and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead-up, an internship places, training places, Euro jobs and education schemes for refugees and migrants, have to be undouched.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house-mastering, finish work - and motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity doesn't mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day requires a solid structure, tell Deuterle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Human beings would have to develop a seniority.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it offers offers like sports, contacts with native and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also board administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain the refugees that it takes just and the time sense of the time, for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever doesn't have the feeling, he could not help Urbach, do not work and be unprofitable, who will never integrate to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The significant majority are motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem, however, says customer to be honest, "People, where nothing goes nothing." the work of Deuterle and the customer is therefore always motivating others to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth job."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do they have fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine customer says something clearly, "what they are called naiv." a residual risk could not be able and would not exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensibilizes are the helpers already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassination bring them completely in call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So there must be main and volunteers on site and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background you always have a new push for refugees and migrants to Urbach come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="57">Do Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly says to answer, the policy of politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to introduce helpers on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived there where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the urbacher has also been utilized to integrate the previous people's rational.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">Nevertheless, when people are in need, let them help them, both women are united.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no simple answers.</seg>
