Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of an international agreement as well as in Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abil@@ iti@@ an actions in the Middle East .
the conflict with the Palestinians and the talking about two @-@ states are expected to follow at the meeting .
the ratio between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been curious .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing sett@@ ling of Israel and casts Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s promising will at the peace process .
in the deal , by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated even the relationship of the two .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held an invitation to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress which was considered a fri@@ es against Obama .
the talk was not addressed to Obama , a meeting had rejected the election in Israel with a reference to the im@@ min@@ ent elections .
in a emergency call , Professor , shot his gir@@ l@@ friend
in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon is said with a loud voice of the police that he shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and that the officials will need to come to his house .
it was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably abandoned , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house there were the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note , which was crit@@ ically modified on a white block : &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was done by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no reference to those that had traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , who had already left 300 miles to the school premises , where he was shot and killed at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ sign@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford told that those who have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that he did the fatal emergency call eventually at some point .
until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police seized him .
one day after the shooting in the university , the students and do@@ z@@ ards are forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to pro@@ cure a picture of what is motiv@@ ated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at the two ends of the State published details , such as students and employees who knew him , helped me to draw a picture of a talented but maybe difficult instructor .
students said they were looking forward to his classes .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ab@@ iss died , did he have no history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt himself had mentioned in one of his written book , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; for whom he shared his academic life .
they both lived in the department for social sciences and history , whose teachers are 17 members , and many students visited lessons from both of them .
at the same time , there were some incl@@ inations regarding problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ int , fi@@ anc@@ er , said he appeared to be a little nerv@@ ous and nerv@@ ous , &quot; as if something wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , told him that he told him that he had nothing to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
he had previously asked the Delta State University to vote for health reasons and said that he have some health problem .
in this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in employment policy of the university was meaning@@ ful that the doctorate , for the Lamb that had so hard worked , would be no guarantee for an automatic road to be identified as Assistant Professor .
the President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he knew nothing of a conflict between me and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was Mr Lam@@ bs show something of course . &quot;
these are questions that can &apos;t answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , police later found lam@@ bs that he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he was arrested , he killed herself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; outskirts on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran even in the entry .
it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why he went back to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there .
it grew up in the area .
in 2009 , he began work at the university , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city of around 12,000 inhabitants , taught Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in the spring of education .
one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs led him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and fun .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said that she was 15 and the lamb was 20 when they met with friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach the guitar game .
he was then the old black s@@ warm .
all girls melted away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson city of Bran@@ don .
staff and Pr@@ ent@@ iss have obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document of an marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the baking stone house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the former husband of Pr@@ ab@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were left for 15 years ago , but friends were left and a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed in the bottom , &quot; he said &apos; Ste@@ en on his daughter . &quot;
they and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met him , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and blues playing .
he arrived at Pre@@ ent@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail had appeared on a Summer market three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter , and she sings their own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse , which worked for several companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes enter@@ taining , at The Jul@@ ys Room , a faint bar in the vicinity of G@@ auti@@ er , said that he had finished meal and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night at night 5 September for the last time , having finished his guitar and oral harmon@@ ic game ended up an exciting audience .
there was no evidence that anything did not agree .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were in the Place and S@@ uns .
I mean , they both had a good sense of sh@@ ear .
Schmidt , the dead prof@@ essor@@ ship , initiated the first semester seminar program and specialized in amer@@ ican native people and colonial history , Don Allan Mitch@@ ell , a English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Em@@ por@@ ia State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and students .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cleveland , including Do@@ z@@ ard , employees , students and members of the church at a candle light ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ wife Ms. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the event &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
classes will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported in Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associated Press , Emil@@ y Wag@@ est P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to contra@@ di@@ ct that the police reported that he had shot the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt and knew that he had married his wife as his wife , but there &apos;s no reference to that they have married .

Michael J. Fox S@@ uns about his &quot; Date with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre over the Roy@@ als and I perc@@ eive that the seat is empty before me , and it will gradually clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an im@@ pending documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a sim@@ ulated ste@@ els and a arm length of it removed with the prin@@ cess of Wales in a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , and with Director Robert Z@@ em@@ eb@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .

UN boss says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon says that its response to Russia is reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; that lasted almost five years , and more weapons will be wor@@ sens to millions of people .
the UN High Court demands once again all parties , including the United Nations Security Council to un@@ ite and support integ@@ rative negotiations to fin@@ ders a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council of the United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the outskirts of the General Assembly to meet in this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
he was sorry that the ab@@ stain@@ ing in the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers will make this situation dis@@ sol@@ uble . &quot;
ban called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , that they have demonstrated in the agreement of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 remov@@ es values which show that Donald Tr@@ ump fe@@ asts is being taken .
some have tried to buy him as a flop .
others have taken him one joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but it doesn &apos;t matter how a few rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper edges near to the bottom , it did not work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national poll@@ s showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double digits , and some start to ask what it means the nom@@ ination of the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is too early in the elec@@ toral term .
nobody said that Tr@@ ump will probably gain the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys Gui@@ ded tour of which Herman Cain was released , none of which also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would like to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth do recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s cor@@ ps and start their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some recent survey volumes that suggest that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular properties have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University , that only two of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have seen the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
early August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
these figures do not keep in early countries .
in I@@ owa , a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac line in I@@ owa found that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P @-@ voters are happy with dump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans would be either &quot; insp@@ ires &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two of 10 say they were &quot; anno@@ ying , &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son makes about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be hoo@@ ked &quot; vs. 40 percent , which would say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in enthusiasm of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; stum@@ bled , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favourite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans can &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump will therefore widely apply for his bombs and cont@@ ested statements , 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans to Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that the real estate business is the right temper@@ ament to President , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same figure is in the first ant@@ in@@ discri@@ min@@ ate state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he hired the personality for a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
still , 44 percent think that he doesn &apos;t have the personality to carry out his job , and almost six out of 10 un@@ dependent that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House P@@ asse , such as ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters felt the idea .
when they set their funds , republi@@ can voters stop Tr@@ ump in real terms .
if they are asked if they will receive the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C out of the last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of 10 end of July turned their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters had not the clear crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination up to only 28 % for the final candidates of Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , show that a variety of GO@@ P voters can watch the campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible .
even when the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans min@@ ed around another candidates , Tr@@ ump yet counts for almost everyone .
some experts prove that the sh@@ atter@@ ned fields will probably join the spl@@ itter@@ ing box during the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and the majority of other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump supports majority support .
in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before rim Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would bring an entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a close majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they formed their opinion .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump will say they have fixed their voices .
of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said they have open the door to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other external broad@@ band , neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but elec@@ tors , who have formed her opinion , are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with dump at the subject of immigration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign against two months of immig@@ rants from Mexico called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called &quot; rape , was the migration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course .
some are concerned that the atomic facts of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ p@@ ano @-@ American from the Republi@@ can party and the re @-@ oriented effort will be dam@@ aging .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans agree that they agree with dump questions regarding immigration .
so as long as the immigration falling down in the r@@ amps , it will also do Donald Tr@@ ump .
fru@@ stration among the government climbed up to new high@@ s .
in Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of the republi@@ can voters are dis@@ appearing , above all by her out@@ sider status .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ tag@@ onal survey of ABC / Post , they would prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are w@@ ron@@ ged in Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans can be fru@@ str@@ ated in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; pol@@ arity . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ th@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential community - with views over the North Sea .
in the street a square meter space for a half @-@ storey house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; Sy@@ lt is the offer of objects of natural as per , &quot; meaning it is in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which special situations one square meter is most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top @-@ hab@@ itats , one of the price but as pe@@ an@@ uts come before .
the real estate provider Angel@@ s &amp; Ful@@ ler has published one ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square met@@ er@@ ings in a di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
since there are several tenth of a thousand Euros - per square meter , well noticed .
but good who can aff@@ ord it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the fore@@ front here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start@@ up thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double go@@ al@@ sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has simply a run .
a lucky statement by Thomas Müller made the way to a thick@@ ened 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ os Pir@@ eus - and then ran it .
a sover@@ eign break of the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze bought a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; vessel through the FC Bayern in the Wit@@ ch chair .
the team of Trainer P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to gar@@ ner double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and I@@ dol@@ ur hits ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth Star@@ ter@@ fol@@ g in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to get to get to Munich on the third attempt .
Müller was awarded the Champions League for the Bavaria @-@ Gui@@ ded Mi@@ th@@ ilfe of the Olympi@@ os @-@ Tor@@ ah Roberto in the Champions League best@@ owed favor of the World Champion in the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ Tour Roberto in the Champions League .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; ( Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised Kar@@ l@@ m in front of the game in Kar@@ ai@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 ) and kept the Munich &apos;s word .
they exhibit a concentrated and dedicated performance without sh@@ it .
Pi@@ raeus won his most recent six home games in the Royal class , including serious clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ u@@ Tor@@ ino .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled here .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ eu@@ up @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams were defeated , didn &apos;t want to be the next sacrifice .
they ran cour@@ age@@ ous , in their offensive efforts but often to un@@ ri@@ fl@@ essly to work .
the attacks were often di@@ ver@@ ted to the left eye on left eye , Douglas Costa , who sel@@ f@@ ished from previous brown @-@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ aou@@ i .
Müller had more luck , when his flan@@ k up@@ side with the right hemisphere in the left upper chamber .
at the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympic Audi@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown is defeated the head@@ ball of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct purchase , the Tor@@ ry Roberto was par@@ ked with kne@@ e ( 3@@ 5. ) .
even though the Bayern dominated their acc@@ ust@@ omed game , pir@@ ae@@ us could set the con@@ i@@ fer .
but in Tor@@ ke@@ ter Manuel New was discount .
as a result , it was a shot of ide@@ ye to the lat@@ er@@ ste@@ es ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of New Zealand , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola extended a qu@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the center near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Divine , after mus@@ cular problems back in the box , sat down outside .
the World Cup hero have given the final light after the ending , he said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , &quot; which is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to replace Gu@@ ardi@@ ola against him when he called King@@ sley Com@@ an for the free Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
go@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller still made a touch .
in front of the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ all .
after a smaller group of partly contra@@ cted Bayern fans showed the supporters of the host Pi@@ raeus , speaking with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went up with the bomb attacks against the Munich trailer .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was transported from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
those who rust@@ y , not only the lung , but also counting the teeth - this is a long @-@ term study near Potsdam .
good news : if the risk of mer@@ ges the risk is reduced quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
this is from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees at the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ F@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , the 2.5 to 3.6 @-@ F@@ ee is higher .
the scientists were observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of dental loss is c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ation of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the link between smoking and loss of gum is therefore down on frequent gum disease in smo@@ kers .
not to be clari@@ fied , how often smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who list@@ ened to smoking , however , could reduce their risk in a short period of time , by researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
at the same time , it could go over ten years until the end@@ an@@ gering return to the level of non @-@ smoking . explained first aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich von der English University of Birmingham .
people should convince people to convince not to get non @-@ smo@@ kers , the teacher manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for the lungs and j@@ ars and leads to our findings too good health health to the high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years were out of tooth @-@ free , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk for early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study per@@ imeter the findings .

the EU Commission proposes a new trial in dispute over the TT@@ IP
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ral system via the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP .
the controversi@@ al private screening equipment for disp@@ utes between companies and countries should be replaced by a transparent system , which in its function is significantly more traditional courts .
&quot; we want to take a system that trust the citizen , &quot; declared the Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Hotel Commissioner by the idea .
the Swe@@ ets has faced a proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
the German government announced support .
the world &apos;s largest free trade area , with 800 million people will be created by TT@@ IP .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedure will be shown specifically that the EU states and the USA will jointly choose independent judges for a new investment .
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third @-@ party countries .
the first instance is en@@ vis@@ aged a second instance .
it would allow it to be appe@@ aled against judgments .
previously , the process took place together on arbit@@ rators , and there was no obj@@ ections to their sentences .
in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in terms of Fair@@ ness and justice doesn &apos;t consent .
long @-@ term it wants to work according to their own information to an International Investment Tribunal .
there could also be any disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries , for example .
the major statements required by major invest@@ or @-@ Sta@@ ats Ar@@ bit@@ ration procedure ( IS@@ DS ) are regarded as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel , through the companies of pollutants ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ance of tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws or to decrease the consumer or environmental standards .
in its first opinions , non @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act confirmed the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ sufficient .
the agreement is to be listed in the trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) in particular for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreements with Canada .
the German Minister for Under@@ secretary , Matthias Mach@@ ir ( SPD ) , promp@@ ted his plans as a great progress .
the commission under@@ took considerable points of the reform , the Federal Minister for Agriculture Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private contrac@@ ep@@ ist@@ als is from the table .
the French government welcomed Spon@@ geb@@ ob &apos;s plans .
the European Business Association of Business@@ Europe warned that pi@@ ge@@ ing options of economy has to limit a lot of new rules .
in particular , small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged that it was called .
when talks on the Free Trade Agreement TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) will continue to be concluded on Wednesday .
the negotiations run since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of invest@@ or protection has not been discussed with the United States so far .

Del@@ ic@@ ular Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) .
besides him , a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the sh@@ unting operations , has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt @-@ tip .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is nearly taken from Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells you several places which he repeatedly identi@@ fies on the card , wor@@ m@@ ely , about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ous and z@@ art arranged songs .
so where they were created , and how it looks , in his hom@@ eland .
since then , Stev@@ ens has been doing as wonder@@ fully creative Irish .
with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; out of ug compos@@ ing songs that can decor@@ ate harmon@@ ious very close to American Folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time into the great op@@ ul@@ ent .
the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan &quot; is one of the first part of a we@@ avers series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be played in a row .
but early in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; seven Sw@@ ans &quot; had already appeared and shows a positive course of expectations .
reduced Stev@@ ens here on .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician will turn back to the series New York .
in 2005 , the &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Reb@@ ate &quot; ) appears a widespread masterpiece in 2005 .
inv@@ enting the ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic Finn@@ s of ideas .
the album also climbed up into the amer@@ ican Bill@@ board charts and is l@@ acks in no point ranking of the influ@@ ential music media .
after an extremely productive experiment , Stev@@ ens then on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) had very extensive electronic per@@ missions .
this sixth Annual studio album is still very wide orchest@@ rated , but by programmed sequences or beats , and plays with all kind of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
long ago for smaller clubs , the stage shows are exhibited here for the colorful spect@@ acle of Neon @-@ Stir@@ ru@@ ps from Neon @-@ Stir@@ ru@@ ps , and large lumin@@ aries .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .

theat@@ res is primarily presenting the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; since March .
although there are almost 2000 guests living in their seats , the well @-@ reaching Stev@@ ens returns to in@@ tim@@ acy and folk .
without creating a word to the audience , the ensemble plays an excellent musician through the wide @-@ enrich@@ ed album .
from the audience you can hear : the lecture is &quot; op@@ ul@@ enter &quot; and you could throw the &quot; plate in the bottom . &quot;
only to a enc@@ ore , Stev@@ ens began a modest appearance , plays acou@@ stically , few older songs and draws for a good appl@@ ause .
Jeremy Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s debut at the fre@@ unde of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s debut with exc@@ itement of the Prime Minister with exc@@ itement ahead of his debut
the new Labour Party Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is to announce his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and went for the first time with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is raised to establish the first of his six pre@@ defined questions shortly after lunch ; his performance of the media is likely to be inspected by the media and the Labour representatives from the vicinity .
he called &quot; fewer theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary approval for Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s , because it comes to his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ atten@@ dan@@ in@@ et and following his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the interim , the decision of the Labour chairman , on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them with a commemorative ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked a review of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S and stands at the centre of several cover pages in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , focused attention on itself
with Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , he would have &quot; stood &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Air Force around England &quot; .
but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Sch@@ atten@@ dan@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Grand News@@ night programme , he decided to sing the National An@@ them , independently of his faith , that the mon@@ archy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of sh@@ adows have refused to serve as Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s top team , and they are called on dis@@ agreements during the economy , defence and foreign policy , whilst less than a sixth of the Parliamentary party supported it as guide .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be stack@@ ed within Labour &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s statements on position towards the European Union and the limitation on certain@@ ties .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limit .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of work and pen@@ sions minister , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it only would be against the government plans to lower the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Socialist chair , which David Cameron , since then he has been leader T@@ ory Chief in the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch @-@ Box in parliament .
the Labour President , promised a polit@@ ician , says that he has committed &quot; C@@ row@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions on Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Fra@@ cking @-@ up of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ation and that it will be made both &quot; impact strength &quot; and its stream@@ lined with resistance and instead , focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle &apos;s sh@@ adows is represented by economic , when he doesn &apos;t participate , for example if Mr. Cameron is on road abroad .
he also brought the idea of conversation that other colleagues on occasion might take the word , and that he spoke John Ber@@ t , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is tied up from politics into the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; that often linked to the fre@@ unde of the Prime Minister . but , a few years later , he dre@@ amed that he failed .
since she was first broadcast in TV in 1990 , the fra@@ gment has been viewed as the most important Bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a driver and his leadership within his parliament , although critics argu@@ ed that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far reforms .

the Po@@ unds increased to data , which had a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage increase . in parallel , the F@@ T@@ SE 100 was enhanced by the highest SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % over the same period last year .
this percentage was the fastest and increased in@@ estim@@ ations over the time of an interest rate since 2009 .
the Po@@ unds increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar at $ 1.@@ 5@@ 505 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump from 20 % after the take @-@ off offer of the Ri@@ val@@ ry AB in Be@@ v .

the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are threatened by expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill states that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more fuel capacity in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is un@@ likely that this department store will compens@@ ate the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less jobs .

it is both - and in the potato tweeter that the Ol@@ den@@ burger snack @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay has developed .
inspired by the pro@@ ver@@ b potato instead of the tweeter &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea introduced him with a poster in a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , &quot; which he had a chance on TV .
since then , in his store a gr@@ illed handle that is equipped with flesh and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ i for the stomach , &quot; by Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea has now decided to enter the Lebanese office in Munich in the meantime .
according to data , it has been protected as a utility patent since recently .

Met@@ cash starts ground level campaign to fight aging Al@@ di@@ - breakdown
Met@@ re tries to protect the IG@@ A branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers has started a ground @-@ in@@ dig@@ nity campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di opened the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets , their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A by ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am marketing and marketing about the social media , as well as events such as Adelaide Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ er Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough that distri@@ butes samples and shop @-@ owner who sell for sale tickets for the South Australian football league at yal guests .
it is expected that Met@@ re will receive further details of his defense strategy on 29 September , when wholesale distributors for food , alcohol and devices pass through its annual investors strategy .
it is much on the game because South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ shop rides and generate greater profit mar@@ ches as the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern countries .
shopping in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ep@@ tive province of Western Australia and IG@@ A retailers have much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , an@@ alysts are like Morgan Stanley that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets about five percent of the food market in these two states will be removed and all existing actors , but mainly self @-@ employed sales .
a report published in this week , according to Morgan Stanley , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley estimates that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose around $ 360 million in revenue per year and up to US $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this predi@@ ction is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di will be opening 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , and generate sales of $ 500 million and a $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in the food@@ stuffs and the market and the quantities at Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s high fixed base could cost Met@@ cash roughly 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ ax@@ e &apos;s market share in the eastern countries , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A buyers are the leaders .
Morgan Stanley is decre@@ asing that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will decline in food and food market by 3.8 percent in 2016 , in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told one business eat in Melbourne , that Met@@ rics will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ rics refused to respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board with Mr Dou@@ glass has been made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Industry , which has around 1,200 IG@@ A retailers globally , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , refle@@ cting its operative debt reduction in turnover and mar@@ gins .
the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers however , however , is investing more than 150 million $ , in order to sell sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths , while improving products every week , and to improve their shops by faster growing fresh foods , and to provide a better choice of private @-@ label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and load rehabilitation programmes to Elan are hop@@ ing that the Grand distributors in 2017 will return to profit@@ ability for the first time in four years .
Tan@@ asi co@@ ch@@ illi is supported by the President of the Australian tennis banned Steve He@@ aly
Tan@@ asi co@@ ch@@ ak@@ is deserv@@ es more praise as a cr@@ iti@@ que for his behaviour .
Tan@@ asi co@@ ch@@ at@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ ril and deserv@@ es his friend Nick Kyr@@ ania and deserv@@ ed the President of the Australian tennis court , Steve He@@ aly rather praise as a cr@@ iti@@ que for its own behaviour .
co@@ ca@@ kin@@ is , the younger of talented Du@@ os , which is always called &quot; Special KS , &quot; came into a spot@@ light by the not@@ orious strug@@ gles of Cy@@ rus with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the Montreal Masters at the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati , after that , Kok@@ n@@ ak@@ is and his opponent had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rators , whereby Har@@ rison had said : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA have had been hit , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he cr@@ ushed a tennis bat , after a cr@@ amp@@ er def@@ ended a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , was def@@ ended from He@@ aly level .
the te@@ ens is currently at Glasgow , in the contest with Sam Gr@@ oth about second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I am pretty serious , is the fact that after my view there was a little in the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he over@@ thrown the bat as he lost a ra@@ cket in the US Open , but it is not the first player to have a bat of Fr@@ ust together with himself , and I know Tan@@ asi is good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has got himself extremely well in the US Open , even below the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think it deserv@@ ed a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around it , and I believe that he was a little too in@@ treated .
he is a very strong 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never qualified any problem with the other players he is trained well . he is trained well , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe it deserv@@ es it to become judged by his own services .
He@@ aly supported also the decision , Cy@@ when begins with the important preliminary ruling that begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he securing the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term essential part into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition , and not all around the control areas around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick has made very fast the asc@@ ension , which he gets like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he gets in the eyes of the public , and he may try to do it . some time out of the ramp in which he can think about it , I think it is best for the crew and it is best for him and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emer@@ gen@@ cies , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency situation and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border as hundreds of immig@@ rants re@@ acted in one ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and were re@@ acted to indig@@ nation with indig@@ nation .
people who fled the violence took place in an unknown period in a country strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built up tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations rose .
as a police helicopter on them , migrants &apos; inaugur@@ ates the border ! &quot; and cried Bel@@ je@@ an against Hungarian will@@ ing@@ men .
some goes back from protest to Food and Water .
on the Serbian foreign minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be un@@ acceptable in Hungary , while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be a part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral Damage .
in the coming days of discussions with Brussels and other countries , &quot; Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the tur@@ bul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serb border , one day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ blo@@ c , had no joint immig@@ rate in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who had sought refuge in the tor@@ mented Italy and Greece . they afflicted their hope that the EU states would take another 120,000 refugees , including some of Hungary , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
Hungary had not put his hopes on a hard drive of Brussels or from its neigh@@ bors .
on Tuesday , in two southern regions , authorities called more powers to handle the crisis , so that they could spe@@ eded up streets and spe@@ eded up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also has the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along the border to Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having completed a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates remain in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
over the past few months , Hungary has become for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into a major bott@@ len@@ eck and an entrance point into the European Union .
but the Prime Minister Vi@@ ktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are in search of a better life , and not war refugees , which are strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft . ) , which left the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws contain higher adh@@ esion for the tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; he said Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the parliament has to vote the process of military personnel , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters of Associated Press has already seen significant soldiers with vehicles and dogs on day@@ time .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities arrested 45 people in trying to cross the border , 15 others were already lowered into the country .
they come over by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in custody and will be accused of w@@ rest@@ ation of criminal charges in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian civil servants also closed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a bar@@ gain with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos re@@ issued the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary had opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and cr@@ ushed a crowd to get there .
about 20 survived to occur , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants , with the most important highway lin@@ king of Serbia and Hungary , promised that they would like to go for food and water until they could travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head moder@@ ately by Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in the national survey
the former US State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination of national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is winning against the ground .
Clinton has now backed the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 per cent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet announced that he has been developing for the presidential address , receives support of 15 percent of democratic voters .
more than five months before the pres@@ election , most of democratic voters say that it is too early to say that the candidate can support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more en@@ ce@@ ful than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News @-@ survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while winning several wins .
Clinton keeps a huge margin in women and vegetables , but these advantages have reduced themselves .
their support for the male has dropped shar@@ ply , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s mission among democratic voters under 50 years has ch@@ ast@@ ened , and she and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton had a big advantage over the older voters .
in the past month Clinton had a 5 @-@ point lead over the liberal , but S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic elec@@ tors in the country plan to say that they would support her enthusiasm when it would be nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reserves and just 15 percent would only support them because they are the can@@ did@@ acy .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially thr@@ illed from all of her .
the views are stronger with those that are currently not support Clinton - only about a quarter would love them enthusi@@ astic .
while 48 percent of democratic voters will say that she would support Clinton to enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters using their peak current Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when clinics are asked to ask in an open question , why they want the can@@ did@@ acy for it is the most common answer that she is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clinton &apos;s to support their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement concerning problems with problems and voters are also cited .
since the vice @-@ president th@@ rows an potential for the presidential election in the Wa@@ iting bowls , 57 percent of democratic voters will see him in the race - though a third believe he should not do it .
if Democratic Vot@@ ers were asked for the elections , who would be a second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the helm .
by Clin@@ t tra@@ ilers more than half , that Bi@@ den would be the second vote far from scratch .
if they decide to know the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton increases the lead to S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
five and fifty percent of democratic voters were seeing affili@@ ation as can@@ did@@ acy among the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen by 78 percent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that has seen him as the &quot; choose &quot; has increased .
nevertheless , with the question thereafter , what is more important for a candidate , Democratic Vot@@ ers call over the voters .
similarly as in the last month , not a c@@ rat@@ c@@ rat@@ a candidate or a cont@@ ender candidate for those voters are called un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results with some important features among voters from their party elections .
multi @-@ fre@@ ed@@ oms , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den , hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts off among the three candidates best from hon@@ esty while Clin@@ ics is the leadership &apos;s leadership .
thirty per cent of democratic voters think that Clinton &apos;s hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have a mind of him .
Democratic Vot@@ ers can generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ology in accordance with their views .
all these measurements has a quarter of the democratic voters no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions to Hill@@ ary Clinton would continue to use a personal e @-@ mail address and server during the ten@@ ure as an external Minister , most of the Democratic Vot@@ ers are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that there did not affect their opinions in total .
but it is a total story in the American public .
half of the Americans is now not satisfied with their explanation , but only about one @-@ third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was divided in March , shortly after the problem was to light .
most of the Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general consent of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their thoughts have still deterior@@ ated .
there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of them , who say that their Vi@@ ews of Clinton become worse .
although Clinton &apos;s watched by the voters of their party as being hon@@ est and trusted , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less than in May .
62 percent of those entitled voters think they are not counted for a tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time 55 percent of those entitled to legitim@@ ate nations are not est@@ ly hon@@ est and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive a good score at guidance .
out of the six candidates , Be@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush came best at amb@@ ition .
a majority looks more hon@@ est but hon@@ est , but as with Car@@ son many no opinion of him have .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic Vot@@ ers : 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son re@@ sign@@ alled close by Donald Tr@@ ump near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times tight behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the two candidates , half of the voters falls in the new survey , and others lose work dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continues to support Tr@@ ump in great numbers nationwide . the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was carried out on the Fox News debate in the last month in order to receive 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son flow@@ ed from 6 % over the same period to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son occurs well at demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ pass Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Govern@@ or John Kas@@ ich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins or Scott Walker , who is at the deepest point , 10 % of the last month in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida @-@ Govern@@ or J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio is at 6 % on the third place .
the error mar@@ ge in the sample of 376 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , indicates that Car@@ son rises in poll@@ s - it uses 19 % support from Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the dump with 32 % support .
the most recent pol@@ l of ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
at a glance at one of the last week , Car@@ son found some side bars for former neuro@@ surgery , after Car@@ son found himself exc@@ used to issue Tr@@ um@@ ps faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaigns show in I@@ owa .
pleasant swimming temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even when the top values are measured only in distance , a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough to host the hot water .
a bathroom in the North or Baltic Sea should be at a maximum of 17 degrees in a short short .
no more go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
it continues to operate the Mediterranean : in the East , it even comes up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic sea , it is 25 degrees in France , and 23 degrees in France .

five members of the Brotherhood mist@@ akes with the death of a Baruch College
almost two years after a student during a ch@@ ic@@ onic rit@@ ual , as a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ et has been submitted against five people .
members of the New York Baruch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ si capture Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g was brut@@ ally accepted and delayed by his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death in September 2013 .
civil servants said that he had been stressed with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack of sand , and repeated attacks while trying to go through a frozen field on a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g was thinking about head@@ aches , then he was un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was released and waited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , such as the police .
they , however , had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to review his symptoms of goo@@ s and Andy Men@@ g , the national President of the Brotherhood to advice , said Poli@@ mark Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point we began to hide the members of the u@@ ten@@ sil@@ ia and in principle the prosper@@ ity of the Brotherhood , on Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ mark Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his injury .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g were repeated with bl@@ unt power violations of the head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; to many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student has been killed every year since 1970 on the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ a family , in a declaration .
Bru@@ der@@ ies and their members must be drawn to account , and this step by authorities is very important .
County Grand Jury of Monroe set an accus@@ ation for murder of third degree for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with sh@@ y attacks and formation of a criminal organization .
&quot; we do not want to charge the involved persons , but when there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - this is why we will also commit these to account , &quot; says Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the mouth of Baruch wrote the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood rejected their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
an interest increase is , and the house is in refu@@ elling , R@@ end@@ ites for bonds are rising , and the economy will lead in a recession .
we know that .
what we do not know how long will it take and hold how long it will stop .
in particular , the history offers only a low guidance for the economy .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ vity of the Federal Reserve by lifting up interest rates is often , if not always , a factor there such as the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , the representative of the US Central Bank has pre@@ ten@@ ded so strongly that investors could not concentrate on giving interest rates , but rather to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could find that all the exc@@ itement was possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated due to a interest rate .
&quot; the first raise of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will not be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheaper money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we are not expecting the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at low level to make the seism@@ ic shock that seems to be feared .
however , this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a view on historical trends , where some areas of economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the advance of interest rate increases by interest rate makes things for a while .
as soon as the increase meets , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to decrease assets between 12 and 24 months after the first increase in the monetary policy , &quot; said German Bank an@@ alysts &quot; said in a recent study , what happens after interest of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather sh@@ allow in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to a recent analysis in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief designer strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank reported that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to occur later in the increases life cycle , and the return to decrease is expected to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases it often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions that could not accelerate before and accelerate the recession .
it is extremely interesting that the gross domestic product is in the vicinity of its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the nominal GDP reaches the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only few will wait for the third quarter , only 1.5 percent would be expected for the third quarter .
Z@@ ins@@ ist during such a frag@@ ile economic scenery could be ris@@ ky and throw up the question , &quot; if this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made the whole year on a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes had been fixed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ist and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could only be an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade show only a 25 per cent probability .
&quot; in our study , all increases in relation cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing spon@@ sor@@ ption in GDP and before the beginning of recovery in the shade , &quot; thus the report .
in contrast , this is quite a slow recovery of what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months .
the fixed income was even more vol@@ ati@@ l because the market increases the rate of interest , and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than shares when they change their strategic course .
in bonds , bor@@ row@@ ings appear to change the direction as soon as the initial increase / reduction occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increases life cycle ends , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result that R@@ end@@ ites would lead closer to longer and shorter bonds and lead to a curve at the curve .
highly interest bonds often bring in such a climate better yields , although &quot; we are still careful to anticip@@ ate higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ alysts &quot; said in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , Jones , the fact that the markets are already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are some evidence that the market has been adapted to the outlook on the stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the encour@@ aging ur@@ ve is flat@@ ter , lending experience , and the vol@@ at@@ il@@ ity has risen , all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the big and all , companies that are in the major part of their business activities in the USA are able to benefit if interest rates and local products are attractive .
multin@@ ational corpor@@ ations with high debt will be worse than a growing dollar of products on the global market , as well as the financing of their debt .
&quot; the history shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks to react extremely positive for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ An@@ alysts said in a report to the customer .
companies with strong balance sheet total companies decreased by 5 percentage points after each of these increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital contributions and low volume of Vol@@ at@@ ility on their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
company with a high percentage of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure shares , consumers are also able to benefit from increasing rising .
savings could see gains of higher yields , even if experts from different opinion can be done quickly as soon as possible .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says member of the member Andrew B@@ ingham
the Con@@ servative Party of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for its &quot; st@@ up@@ id &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not to be distinguished by commercial Ri@@ vals .
he also asked the BBC Music Awards , saying that she only german only The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ collective Dam@@ ien Collins attacked The Voice of The Voice and said that this was not a originally original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , claims to become a member of parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does something that will not do the private broadcast@@ ers .
Mr. Andrew B@@ ingham , the conservative President Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC bos@@ ses that publicly @-@ legal radio stations , &quot; st@@ up@@ id &quot; and increasingly being unable to distinguish any commercial compet@@ itor .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to turn the word &quot; st@@ up@@ id &quot; but it seems to turn classic FM to turn , &quot; he said .
he was also listed on the BBC Music Awards , starting in December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began last year seem to seem to be under another name .
so , if you are trying to do something else - this is two spont@@ aneous examples where you &apos;re actually only im@@ it@@ ating what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director gave the alleg@@ ations back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial compet@@ itor when it comes to live @-@ music and re@@ conn@@ aissance .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music somewhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that really is sur@@ passed .
&quot; and to give the commitment of Radio 3 , new music and work on order to give new works , I also felt very important , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller , Alan Dav@@ ey , announced that har@@ der had to be working to eng@@ age the audience as it was in the past because the British informed about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing of the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport included among fire , to tre@@ ad the commercial Ri@@ val@@ en on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Collins : the Voice to - the musical talent show of BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producers of Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not originally , and not particularly striking ?
LORD Hall consisted already that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Justice - &quot; was produced in a special BBC mode .
he added that the company wants a hit from our in @-@ house shed , &quot; if it &apos;s the next time a fun series .
however , ref@@ using to exclu@@ de the order from other rows of The Voice in the Future or to exclu@@ de money from star@@ ters for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales continued in August at slow@@ est down and in Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , the lowest result since the beginning of records started in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that Black Friday in November posted issues
for over one decade , the virtual shopping has ar@@ ous@@ ed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost@@ ed@@ die .
but experts say that the online sales have been stag@@ n@@ ating , after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the time of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are reports that online sales have stag@@ n@@ ating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and then go back to 2000 , during the time , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales outlet , has been suggested .
he explained that the online sales were more reinforced with their mobile phones three years ago .
it meant that more people could purchase online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. home on the sofa .
but now it is getting up and we &apos;ll be able to see that growth decreased .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for demol@@ ition revenues .
experts believe that buyers will take place their purchases on the last Friday in November last Friday .
last year , five times the average number of buyers to make their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites come down .
experts believe that Black Friday would assume the buyer for bar@@ gain , buyers could be able to stay buyers .
a study of the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spend a little more than 1 £ online .
in some products such as television and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of its purchases is now performed via Web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people &apos;s clothing and shoes are buying online instead of the fashion labels inside the city cities .

now , King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group would not have standing the arm of the sick , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of L@@ gs , which was published by the state @-@ of @-@ the state of Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden group is responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ ling@@ ual service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership is prohibited abroad .

the bin Laden group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Decree no@@ des also imp@@ acted the Group because of not current safety measures , because they did not have sex with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of Kr@@ all@@ ians surrounded Mec@@ ca big mosque as a part of the massive building which is led by the bin Laden group .
since decades , the bin Laden is connected with the family of Saudi Arabia and takes over greater construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a de@@ ceased son who was discovered by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane met in the middle of strong winds and rain only few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is at least once in the life of a healthy body .
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials assigned to 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the people who are to pay and compare the same amount of permanent injuries .

the func@@ tion@@ aries of A@@ I / D@@ whether because of un@@ faith@@ fulness in court
on Wednesday , the Provin@@ cial Court of Klagenfurt have two officials of the Austrian volleyball tournament A@@ I / D@@ whether because of un@@ faith@@ less and proc@@ urement .
the def@@ endants are not guilty .
one of them was also charged with counter@@ f@@ use .
he was acquitted of this alleg@@ ation in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the investigation that the def@@ endants were disp@@ ers@@ ed in the years 2006 to 2011 , when they were disp@@ ers@@ ed in their functions , used for private purposes .
it protects the damage with approximately 400.000 euros .
the sports work is also charged with financial regulation .
this fact f@@ are@@ well the Chair@@ woman of the Court of Scho@@ el@@ en@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , Austria .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the loss of un@@ faith@@ fulness the defence case reported that an asset ratio was not taken at no time .
the sports work would have been calculated only for promotion reasons and the sports club for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and invested much time and money , according to liabilities - the Passi@@ va had approximately 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 44@@ ,000 euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; at that time we stood before the situation : &quot; we carry the club more or un@@ lock the club , &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ professionals of the financial market .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take this job .
with all risks .
&quot; we have fin@@ ed money to see our insurance policies as security at the Bank , &quot; he said during the introduction .
with the association it was agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debt has to be made .
furthermore , upon corresponding financial statements , the payout of the withdraw@@ als for re@@ charges was decided by 1991 .
therefore , one part of the fee is due only three years later , as a plus on the account was paid out .
therefore , either Pau@@ line and not detailed surveys , the former Observatory explained the process operations .
the accounts and savings of the two accused collec@@ tively , the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs on the association do not be revealed in detail , asked the judge .
the association has not been interested in detail for the financial ar@@ ming , important is the freedom of debt , and the answer .
in 2011 , when an ess@@ ay was started investig@@ ating authority , an amount of 120,000 Euro was transferred to the club account .
the latter had been , declared the def@@ endants .
this entry account expired on the name of the second accused , and was not known to the association according to its testimony .
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
this was asking a reply for a long time .
then he thought that he was believed that this was the best for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known something of this money , the prosecutor introduced in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endants had been informed , just@@ i@@ fies the func@@ tion@@ aries .
this transfer has been formulated as &quot; Damage repar@@ ation &apos; .
why damages ? , wanted to know judge and prosecutor .
it declared that the first def@@ endant , who was not agreed with this formulation , because the association was never caused a damage to the association .
but what should I do when the attor@@ ney says , &quot; You are all of you out of the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; do I have a legal agent ? , &quot; he asked .
furthermore , he said that he has never related a cents , he only spent o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
at Di@@ ets , he paid € 1,000 per month into account the actual out@@ lay , however , had been much higher , he added .
the accused could not refer to documents for the early years .
these be declared after an operation test , in which all has been judged correctly , un@@ declared that they declared .
the other accused had also lost the kilometre money .
all the accommodation may be in cash , in which he must be driving out of his place for the Bank to Ab@@ re@@ burg , he stated in his testimony .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the hearing of witnesses .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non@@ violence of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have deployed along the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ den@@ as and I@@ j@@ ector for several hundred def@@ icient refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ward @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced the force of violence at the bound@@ ary point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke out the fron@@ tier .
behind him , a polic@@ eman formed and behind the polic@@ emen trained a water j@@ ector .
40 to 50 Refu@@ ge@@ es started throwing stones , blocks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the civil servants carried out un@@ interrupted pep@@ per@@ mint .
the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
Mu@@ en@@ eng@@ a was spra@@ yed in direction of refugees .

time the decision on interest rates for the US @-@ grade
the world is watching if the U.S. base is at two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , comes together to meet the important decision whether for the first time since nearly a decade associated with interest or not .
a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists who were inter@@ viewed by Reuters for a little more than half , which could do the fact that the F@@ ed will continue to do somewhat longer , and the interest rates are kept at this present rate of 0 @-@ 0.25 per cent .
it is a historical event because it &apos;s seven years ago since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est has served on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large Central Bank may face the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Leit@@ der employees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , trillion dollars will be added to the balance and generate just a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less developed outlook on global conditions .
it war@@ ns the markets to raise to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances are that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
death Sag@@ itt@@ arius at the Delta State University , Con@@ vers@@ ed Comp@@ ens@@ ation
following the shooting and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he died on his fellow worker , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to tell him that &quot; on the first murder and wanted to do it , &quot; he could not cause it to be done on Tuesday . &quot;
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that he is a teacher for Ge@@ ography and Social Sciences at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning .
and said , He was shot and put to death on some man .
he said to the staff of the emergency department that police officers must send polic@@ emen to his home .
he said , &quot; I did my wife &quot; evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but nobody &apos;s anno@@ ying will be &quot; but probably getting excited . &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
he gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry so tired , I could go back .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing by the mark , he drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before he eventually took his own life on Monday night , when police officers assassin@@ ated him .
the President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he knew nothing of a conflict between me and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was Mr Lam@@ bs show something of course . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , that is supp@@ os@@ edly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a relationship with Schmidt on Tuesday , there are no information , no evidence , &quot; no evidence , &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was reported by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who had been married about seven years , as a &quot; good man &quot; described .
the two were left 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , He and Pr@@ ent@@ iss have a daughter , which is 19 , and let them be destroyed in the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ab@@ iss had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
pris@@ e@@ iss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ eat .
Know@@ les that Pr@@ ab@@ iss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , had met with him for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help others , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said that I have called comments at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he doesn &apos;t go into prison . &quot;
the police officer took him on Highway 1 in the vicinity of Green@@ ville later in that night , he drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest , and killed himself with a shot .
he received a PhD in Spring 2015 from Delta State University as a doctorate from the university &apos;s website .

in the board of business , Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r &apos;s head will be responsible for Eu@@ rov@@ ings in future Karl Ulrich pra@@ ises .
with the new setup , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Eu@@ rov@@ ings with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can &apos;t play months for double the structure
Luke Sha@@ w walked with the Champions League defeat from Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven a double structure of its right th@@ igh .
while the left field has been rolling for weeping and close it for at least six months from the games , Louis van G@@ aal returns the hope that Sha@@ w is able to play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a rever@@ ber@@ ly attack by H@@ é@@ das Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after which the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V range .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and used oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double structure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow or perhaps a day later he will be moved to Manchester and then in Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then it happens .
in the dressing unit , he had a level of oxygen .
he wept .
I am no physician , but if you have a double structure , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and hanging of a El@@ f@@ m .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , has not punished the Mexican .
van G@@ aal assumed that the Italian arbit@@ rator had v@@ ast@@ ray .
you can decide for himself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very worst attack with both legs .
there was a twe@@ et for Sha@@ ws : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe , as is broken I &apos;m , my way to recovery now , I come back again . &quot;

for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad . I &apos;m sorry so tired .

certainly David Cameron knows David Cameron &apos;s Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents are coming soon : if your child loves a book it will not take it long until you know it almost entirely .
so indeed , you might be David Cameron .
as he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book decided that the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax appeared in 1971 with Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and goes on : &quot; fun , moving , cre@@ atively and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , for it seems to be an image or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , which is supp@@ os@@ edly reveals the action of the book instead , sets a set of the movie version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to extend the quite short original text .
in the midst of the w@@ alled town Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commod@@ ity , likes to see the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , fulfilled the love of his dreams , was to read . a love of love was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss host@@ els and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if the text could not be di@@ ly enough : the text of Cameron stands out in part such as the summary of the Lor@@ ax @-@ movie that is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commod@@ ity , hopes a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
though he ad@@ ver@@ i@@ fies to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron hears the action of the book so little familiar . here , a mad boy , like the local environment due to the cas@@ ings of the name of Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , schn@@ ur@@ b@@ old beings , &quot; which is laid waste in the name of the trees , &quot; is rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was assigned to a hel@@ per , while the Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in a row .
one of the Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s office .
Super@@ camps confirmed that the text by Cam@@ er@@ ons were delivered , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was definitely threatened by England &apos;s competitors , but it still is hard
at Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates it is a difficult task , but when you selected the cad@@ re that has selected England for the Tour , a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card .
I would not close a back@@ ward win .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Page is probably less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the community is strong ; they will bear no Nar@@ row of 2012 , only a you@@ Â @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
this news @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th leaves out of the UK @-@ Test @-@ loader and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and simple but hard reality is that thr@@ ill@@ ers are oriented towards the results .
there were no question of Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said this way - players are their own best cho@@ ices .
long ago , one would have extended the run out of Ly@@ th , but he had the control of his own fate .
if he hop@@ efully hits more le@@ fts for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ trainer Trust in front of Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his position , even if he did not get good performances , and this was surprised by me , he is especially a team man .
the question of how much time a test @-@ stroke receives , to be his sign , is difficult .
Ly@@ th won seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and back@@ wards .
the only alleg@@ ation which can be raised that England first landed in the Caribbean at first - when Ly@@ th was in maximum form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es is coming in , and he is a stroke that I guess .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ eting player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when it comes to a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as they get before it , but this depends of course , of course , in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of winning Mo@@ een in addition to Cook , which would bring an extra @-@ spin slots and would get four jo@@ icks , and I don &apos;t have anything against it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke is not able there , and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket tournaments .
Mo@@ een did not have his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is a number 3 for them , and there is no significant difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at first Drop before he appeared as an Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made immediately three hundred R@@ uns and did not return .
Z@@ ander Ans@@ ari enters the cad@@ re as back @-@ up @-@ sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people can see his statistics at an average of 31 with the bats and 35 with the ball - and think it is an unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers who have lifted their hands and the coach have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England , England has made a few wise additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ es , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as an advisor for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the n@@ ett@@ led score of the game , who is to bring with full@@ ness , as he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is for the white ball phase of the Tour and brings energy and a powerful operation into the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and how Mah@@ ela has in@@ sights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing room cabin , even if the messages are in line with that previously said .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used on the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ leader do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players are tied their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not taken by slight heart .

we could also call between Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb on summit meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a picture of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they build allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to a well outside Britain inside the EU @-@ Zel@@ da , &quot; says Berlin - and leaves us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and no more , short @-@ term ministers and officials were come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or walk .
Germany &apos;s German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally known , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for it , as it happened in ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated ex@@ ag@@ ans such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France is Hollande at his re @-@ election or his suspension in 2017 .
he is also a sound power .
Poland soon became a national@@ ist government , Spain , a left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they are to pl@@ u@@ ate a bite to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be used for it , Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar tenden@@ cies have separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies .
thus , some such ministers may even be deliber@@ ately hop@@ eless comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ end@@ setting in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , probably assumed my boy@@ friend .
&quot; the new trial was a ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has nothing gained from the new negotiations . &quot;
the Europeans know how to burn the Fle@@ et Street on their costs and what EU sc@@ ep@@ tics of the press bar@@ ons is , as they were not inspired by the Secretary of Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 due to our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they are often seen against Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opportun@@ ists , who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
all his re @-@ star@@ ing knew Ed Mil@@ i@@ band who were his enemies .
this was the Med@@ ley of wheel @-@ fe@@ eders , telephone h@@ ack@@ ling explo@@ sions and the pseud@@ o non @-@ incidence that possess most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about them , however , noted that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one sits better ban@@ anas in order to receive him rather than for his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mil@@ i@@ band had contra@@ dic@@ ated more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ders as Bl@@ air himself , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle regarding the Constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which had then opened a back@@ door .
the press has never stopped this .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time for me - seems in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but it must develop a coh@@ er@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s official position in Europe - I have been several times friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ye tendency and the wil@@ dly ge@@ v from Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ English @-@ changing , perhaps everyone can say Yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week said , don &apos;t ad@@ mit that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father got himself hard to his Labour &apos;s cabinet , il@@ lo@@ yal to his Labour &apos;s cabinet , without losing his cabin and his cabin .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
but to fight in order to remain under all circumstances - Benjamin &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell told what Mc@@ C told his fellow disciples and M@@ EP@@ s after all reports on Monday night .
whatever the touch @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to mediate - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all , in the Stru@@ del of Soci@@ etal Media , a brood @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right , Cameron does not give a free ticket for Europe that allowed him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ end@@ setting for a self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility how Mc@@ Donn@@ ell told him .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins are sure of that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s fundamental change comm@@ it@@ ments to the EU membership - in line with her Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ly economy , of their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of the Ukrainian discussion including left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the small difference is a central base of dog@@ matic damages .
as with its comm@@ it@@ ments for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C has no campaign promoted to Australia - will be obliged to try foreign diplom@@ ats , trying to find in everything a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin have shi@@ fted political capital - they also have mis@@ str@@ au@@ ical voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when it can be point@@ less ?
the USA are already quite dis@@ appointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power when I was remin@@ ded of something on Monday &apos;s start on Monday of something which British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was called .
experts Crit@@ ics review by Public Health England about E @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigarettes less harmful substances are made from a meeting of 12 people , some of them sent to tobacco industry , some researchers .
experts who write down in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined the Lanc@@ et by critic@@ izing the demand for e @-@ cigarettes in their report on e @-@ cigarettes in their report .
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have turned the load capacity of the data , and sent to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the Lanc@@ et last month &apos;s medical journal , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ated basis &quot; to which he founded his most important conclusion .
two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims will build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said , the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement consists of a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multiple criteria of decision @-@ making analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that there was a sponsor of the meeting a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously prepared by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated on the meeting had to receive funds of an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing , which he has received according to reports from tab@@ ac@@ companies Philip Morris International in advance .
the reasons for the choice of members of the Gre@@ ens are not delivered but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also specify a sector financing in paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco line from P@@ he took part in the session .
the research work of the group &quot; characteristic is that there is a lack of hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , no such connections or restrictions are discussed in the discuss@@ ing report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; it &apos;s asser@@ ted that &quot; there are no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes would have no evidence as a result of smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J has already responded before .
he said : &quot; E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
each second life of life dies at his Su@@ cht .

P@@ he has the unique obligation to inform@@ ing the public about what the proof of proof , and what does not , especially when it gives so much public confusion over the relative haz@@ ards in comparison to tobacco .

BBC should place East@@ en@@ ders , former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that BBC should stop readers like East@@ en@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Ri@@ val@@ ents would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows as the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee is only to be used to make the type of programs which are not sent by other UK transmitters .
it critic@@ ised the BBC to ensure that they are likely to see public authorities that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ disp@@ uted periods of their ri@@ vals , and transmitters , such as BB@@ C4 .
after BBC general Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to come into contact with BBC 4 in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would be on behalf or sends , which are clearly identified by un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson on the Ober@@ haus communications committee in the context of his research on the future of the BBC .
if you would like to keep the radio fee , what I hold medium or long term it is not intended to keep the production at least on programs that do not make any other or order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to achieve as far as possible support for their future .
the idea that no one would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is natural non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive control programs are financed , which could also be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is a program , East@@ en@@ ders is another program , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm .
I try to see how this is to be public on public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would decrease the BBC .
Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , says that the BBC Deb@@ d on the hunt for people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC will return again , which was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows should sell for East@@ en@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public@@ ised N@@ ic programs &quot; should go to the BB@@ C4 as they cannot meet the audience , and they can be argu@@ ed if they work on their apparent missions for just@@ ification of 4 billion £ free radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those ob@@ sc@@ ents programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a window , where nobody ever wanted to see .
for the Rund@@ funk@@ y , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of terms which can get the best value here .
of course , remember we all think there is a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who is getting a lot of money for the 150 £ , ask me if that &apos;s right , because they consume not much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 Chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC will check out their mission to form and enter@@ tain &quot; . &quot;
he said , only little of the BBC @-@ production would now be classified as a formation , he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should make changes to the public @-@ legal television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to question the partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC will do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are displayed , and with the commercial stations alli@@ ances in order to make everything online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ at@@ et@@ ics &apos; can control cer@@ eb@@ ral cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction in the moment , in which it radi@@ ated with sound im@@ pulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genet@@ ically altered ner@@ ve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change directions in the moment , in which they have sound im@@ pulse , which have to be heard for the human ear to high frequencies , in order to be ir@@ radi@@ ated .
the im@@ pet@@ us work through the turn @-@ old of Mot@@ one@@ on on @-@ cells that is genet@@ ically modified to support the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asound waves .
to read more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new process called Son@@ at@@ et@@ ics , which can be used by ultr@@ asound to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , inv@@ as@@ ive process producing electrical im@@ pulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
they react not to ultr@@ asound but Chal@@ as@@ ani did not react that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found out , intensi@@ fy the ultrasonic waves , which then penet@@ rate the wor@@ ms .
the stronger ultrasonic waves are related to structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in membran@@ es of some of the cells .
the sound waves character@@ izes the opening of this I@@ onic channels and enable the cells to be allocated to them , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultra @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , the Chal@@ as@@ ani genet@@ ically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their m@@ one@@ world TR@@ P @-@ 4 axis channels support .
if it is ultr@@ asound to use changing creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by micro bub@@ bles and switches to wor@@ ms , where they turn on the m@@ ashed m@@ one@@ on one .
the process has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch to neur@@ ons with light of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ at@@ et@@ ics could have some advantages compared to this technology .
in contrast to light , which must be down to an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asound waves may occur un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gen@@ otherapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to susp@@ end the mut@@ ed human neur@@ ons for the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
some applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells .

eight golden rules for the lives in student residence halls
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence for 19 years , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the shar@@ pen@@ ed smile of those who I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the access in halls of student residence is from easy nerv@@ ous until absolute fri@@ gh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to mask : people tell whence you &apos;ve come from , where and where you didn &apos;t listen to Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you &quot; hon@@ est@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love you , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just an yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe through .
help others to do the same - Ask question and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find people who would not talk to them with which you would not speak , even if your lashes would be burned in fire and fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people let people live .
the room of people will often transform itself into drinks @-@ reception , film night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people move on and their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start at the university with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ es a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge but many of the halls of students form a room @-@ to @-@ room B@@ um@@ mel culture that can be friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ life friendship .
that can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want to pass on our friendship , but you have to go away to stop the energy that I have used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ it@@ onal of soci@@ ability is exhau@@ sted - and send SMS to take an SMS place .
speaking of A@@ pro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship exclu@@ de through baking .
since you begin the Uni at the peak of Back Man@@ ie , the clo@@ p on the doors of man , in order to imagine with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es , less stran@@ gely enough as the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something wei@@ rd at you . so , and now please smile when I asked you a couple of personal questions . &quot;
homemade le@@ ak@@ y shops are a good way to close friendship .
your roommate wanted to enter@@ tain themselves to enter@@ tain and become associated with a delicious surprise at the end of perhaps your face .
of course it depends on whether you are an independent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat led to make people as@@ le@@ ep , if you come ank@@ ets .
to steal food , there is a common crime in student residence .
of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is a theft , but it is the take a drop of milk for your tea ?
check that with the bl@@ ender .
the chances are good that they can say to themselves , even if they cook inside the inner city .
if a man tells your stuff , it is anno@@ ying , and you try to deal with compassion as my fellow @-@ fellow worker , who added her milk an agent that surro@@ unds the milk to th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
you should make no noise , who stops people from sleep or working .
it &apos;s not just therefore to be an independent human being , but that you are among the true sense of pro@@ ver@@ ies to men , which are in the gl@@ ass@@ y .
a girl in my hall asked their neigh@@ bors , whether it makes them something , Dr@@ um &amp; bass is a little qui@@ eter than there it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a trial in the morning .
they already responded to the tun@@ er music .
when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock in the morning , she left her neigh@@ bors who left their own music then left their own music , shut up their door , and went on her three @-@ hour examination .
would it be too romantic when your future sp@@ ouse would move to the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be very deep if you keep a fellow worker for your future sp@@ ouses that they must go again and see them every day and perhaps to see how they bring together all common friends to himself ?
of course , the heart passes his own paths - but if a hot fellow is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try to speak a little understanding of understanding .
at the striking moment in which you notice that someone has his keys in his not closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing , when it seems .
a good one is fun but it only takes moments until he gets to the brook .
get through ge@@ ck@@ ons a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but don &apos;t miss someone &apos;s room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door and place your key into a glass of water which then you put in the freezer - but keep your owners along the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , all min@@ ors , od@@ d @-@ destro@@ yers

so , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees &apos; refugees &apos; living room , just as well as the only experienced mothers and the s@@ ing@@ er@@ ener . &quot;
&quot; I think the 44 @-@ year @-@ old says that the 44 @-@ year @-@ old says in the interview .
thousands of refugees are stored in the residential market .
the business@@ man Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on how fast un@@ tra@@ ce@@ able living space can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on many refugees on the H@@ ousing Market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on a mass housing in containers or g@@ ym@@ s has no sustainability .
for the people remain in a great part here .
given the refugee river , we also need enough living space in the next decades .
a very special , three storey row house is the solution .
Gil@@ da : a terra@@ ced house needs the least rank .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if the people are taught in blocks .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three dwelling units for each of the four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say , it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can be converted slightly to their respective needs .
how high are the cost ?
Gil@@ bor@@ d : the price of 160 square meters living space per house is 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
it is reasonable .
does the construction regulations cause their plans to be complicated ?
Gil@@ gam@@ ers : constitu@@ tionally I have recorded my project correctly .
it is especially complicated , making it the above @-@ mounted Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ etian &apos;s special construction and the plac@@ ements regulation .
big , gr@@ ass@@ y .
it is still under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed , who created three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the community acts on their terra@@ ced house ?
mer@@ cen@@ aries : there were they who were accused of creating luxurious conver@@ sions for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but are not spar@@ ing the competitors claiming to be paid ?
Gil@@ gam@@ ers : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had built a boom in Germany , but were built for luxury apartments that can hardly be aff@@ ord to aff@@ ord more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living room .
not only refugees , but also the alone mother or the s@@ wollen sheep .
I think , as you can still just be able to build and well .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple releases are released
the new operating system can be requested by selecting the app to &quot; General &quot; type and then select &quot; software update . &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , you can install the phone option to download and install it .
some are exposed to problems as soon as they get trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting , since it is an error message that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to wait , either to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght returns or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may probably be the del@@ etion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the dis@@ able updates un@@ likely . likewise , it will be easier to delete users when you want to set a special tool , and then re @-@ install it immediately when the process is finished .
it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is charged while updating , or is close to a loading device , so the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple Un@@ locks that the update is going down , as the phone may dis@@ connect to half @-@ way ways and lead to a breakdown of updates .

during the jung@@ le of the cliff , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is ahead of his successor in the coming months still with half a spot on the side .
after the re@@ building phase Müller began the practice on 12 October , until then he has invested 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympath@@ y on the first sight , when the fel@@ lows ahead of years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met to meet her medical practice in the gold hospital and comm@@ its coming to practice in practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ipe and laugh@@ s .
&quot; when it was so , I simply called it . &quot;
the idea , in the future , pleased the idea to operate the own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and permanent contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he can also see his own boss .
thus , one became clear , the gar@@ bage bought the house with practice .
they will continue to stay in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller was also growing up , followed by his medical studies in Hannover , followed by several physician offices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed Chief Executive Officer in the circle of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is working on a volunteers at the DR@@ K @-@ Al@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of 19 September , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ lowship has worked as a hom@@ et@@ ologist , his wife is specialized in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology ( inter@@ ne@@ st@@ in ) .
the tr@@ ash , both lock@@ ers , want to leave themselves as a hom@@ ec@@ ologist .
&quot; the end of the End@@ os@@ copy goes out &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ asound examination and long @-@ term and load EK@@ GS , and need one speaker room more .
furthermore the ED@@ V is completely renovated .
a total of 50,000 Euros will receive a gar@@ bage dump from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as by the sam@@ ba ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are looking forward that the practice is rel@@ ayed , &quot; re@@ iter@@ ates the following progn@@ osis of Bernd Bor@@ mann .
about 2000 patients come from Silvia Mu@@ eller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter into the practice field breaks , in the north German average practice there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another general practice of office .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ipe in As@@ endorf .
if no replacement would have found , it would have gone too .
on the way , who visits the rub@@ b@@ room at the way , she still looks in familiar faces : take the seven medical professionals and the cleaning strength of the Fel@@ low@@ out .
together with their departure , As@@ endorf ends a era , after all , the physician started practic@@ ed for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; reminds of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ipe shots .
it satis@@ fies them after a long time .
&quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will see you often , &quot; says the inter@@ ne@@ st@@ in .
your man compl@@ ains : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; until now I pushed me with gar@@ dening , now that &apos;s going to be different . &quot;
and moreover , the pair has two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; from now on the border controls on our southern border , &quot; Minister Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , &quot; said :
the controls on the Hungarian border will maintain in parallel .
however , it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum request will also be &quot; of course . &quot;
the power and safety of people get in the fore@@ ground .
yet it is clear that &quot; it takes clear signals , &quot; said the Minister .
the people must know that we do not accept migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled course .
Croatia p@@ onder@@ ed &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia expi@@ res
the Croatian government had previously told that Slovenia would continue to travel on refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and to build cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
but this was not all the Minister for the Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar in Ljubljana .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather be the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary .
the border with Croatia is already heavily monitored as the border @-@ border of the shr@@ ine .
as the Minister of Ministers , Slovenia wants to continue his limits for refugees , but does not work .
&quot; every EU Member must re@@ plen@@ ish his obligations , otherwise the system can &apos;t work &quot; , emphas@@ ized Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ l .
as the Croatian government divided , the first refugees had already been attemp@@ ting to travel in East Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ ID in order to soak up the registration .
the Croatian police could gra@@ b them in the surrounding corn fields .
according to local media , police cars with new refugees since then met in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it was mainly between Syrians and Afghanistan , including many women and children .
ambul@@ ance service and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country with about 4000 refugees , Minister Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , said .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo , of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border , displac@@ ed to Hungarian border , directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday reported .
the government of Belgrade denied it , however , that it is to hit certain routes , certain routes : &quot; neither can we do it , &quot; whose name was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serb border of S@@ ID , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were the whole night of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border of about 500 kilometres away by Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary had made us , so the police said that we should move there , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
it might now be that fact that the earlier Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could come to a little further west distance .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for the bound@@ ary control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had pointed out that his country had prepared appropriate plans for the fall of a strong condition of refugees for possible applications .
however , he did not hear , but he pointed out that Croatia is a non @-@ Schengen member , &quot; extensive ways to bound@@ ary control . &quot;
the strict controls carried out in order to qualify for the membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia belongs to this since 2007 , the EU partners established this country a good report which concerns the standard of border controls .
the Serbian border took place behind the Hungarian border z@@ au@@ n , about 300 refugees .
according to the media report , they received the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border @-@ lines ey@@ g@@ os and back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees continue to travel on the Croatian border it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of Home Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic had tried to calm early at a local time in Hor@@ g@@ os : he keep the debates about alternatives of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for early .
it would not take action to deal with very high refugee numbers .
you could not say if they would continue their journey beyond Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers across migrants - dangerous alternatives
however , private tours workers have already begun to distribute the refugees to find maps found in Croatia , on which alternative routes are represented by Croatia .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia , still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the bound@@ ary region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ Res@@ ult : net income advanced for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant lowered his profit views , for a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services , and higher costs in his team @-@ transport service .
the company also said that she is planning to hire approx . 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers on holiday today .
at this point in time , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share reached 2.5 percent in market @-@ market at 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. announced to earn an profit between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 cents less than in the previous forecast .
the an@@ alysts expected a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which will amount on an average of 4.9 percent and on 4th January , and despite higher inci@@ dents for bo@@ ating transport of heavy and large pack@@ ets that will be collected from November .
the company said that it nonetheless earned the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and growth of growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith says that the company brings solid income , considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade , into focus . &quot;
the plans for holiday employment have been announced a day later than those of the giant UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional jobs , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex served 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research in@@ quired an@@ alysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to CHF 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of C@@ acks asked An@@ alysts expecting 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has issued a decline in the international ranking of interest showing the sales in his unit express delivery .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was almost flat , because of higher costs for larger pack@@ ets and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher revenues due to higher rates as the result decreased in the cargo business because of higher labour costs .
at the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares amounted to $ 3.@@ 85 or 2.@@ 85 percent , or $ 15@@ 0.15 .
on Tuesday they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11th .
at the most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strat@@ ford win two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ og@@ any table sitting to decide whether it is time for the first time since nearly a decade of lifting the head@@ lines .
dro@@ h@@ ing over them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey seat string is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a recall that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues will set the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the congress : maxim@@ ize the US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that it is a third @-@ driven third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the near @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the most recent tur@@ bul@@ ence at the global financial markets that make already implic@@ ated F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives could boost these vol@@ at@@ il@@ ity by the interest of interest rates for Bundes@@ an@@ tics , and it is also just around one quarter of the percentage point .
&quot; apparently the labor market and inflation is the most important thing to see what it says , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mac@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think when they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the interest rate , the increased un@@ certainty of around the global market is enough legal to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sens@@ us what the F@@ ed will do what is committed itself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently were surveyed by Bloom@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
financial markets are expected to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase an increase .
this indicates a decrease of the stock market in case the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the Strat@@ es cap@@ tures the blow , by calling them that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones raised average score by 2@@ 28@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed Policy Advis@@ er this week during this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the phr@@ ases to that time , &quot; he said .
if they do it , &quot; it would have to go far away in her declaration to calm the financial markets , so that they do not get in pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an increase in the financial markets is calm , because it would act the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would act to eliminate .
even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to raise the set by 0.25 percentage points to this month , the first small step in a slow deep@@ ening of the month conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in Spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints from liber@@ als that more economical progress would be needed to increase the sentence .
although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years , and near the levels that the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage gains have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation was continually below the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of considerably lower oil prices .
the economy &apos; can handle higher interest rates and needs them due to tension on the labour market , &quot; Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ ited .
but financial markets around the world looked at the end of last month , after China had previously counted its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial median value was more than 16 % below its highest level in May , feared as investors that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would thr@@ ott@@ le global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat in this month , with the Dow Jones achieved now only 10 % below the high level of May .
for the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , the market tur@@ bul@@ ence affect the complex lim@@ estone , when people should raise interest .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of Chinese economy would not have occurred in the last few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US Open .
now he says that they will wait at least one month in order to get the impact better into the grip .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certainty that will be the impact on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data subject to the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is one of the major interests of the F@@ ed , hence should not be included in their decision @-@ making failure .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authorities become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in the past few years .
the blo@@ b note of the then Chief Apostle Ben S. Bern@@ ad@@ ke in 2013 said that the F@@ ed could grow its mon@@ et@@ ric expansion &apos; tight , dis@@ band@@ ed around the globe .
in a world , in the markets and econom@@ ies more increasingly are expected , they can not only super@@ v@@ ise the developments in other locations , but also advice in other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding for the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more Art as Science , &quot; he Zach@@ ary Car@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the management management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted this month , &quot; the F@@ ed has linked a history of convic@@ tions on financial market movements , linked with apparently not with the economic foundation data . &quot;
st@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , aimed at stake for a interest rate , he cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its Leit@@ z with 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite lim@@ iting recogni@@ z@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker .
one year later , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives broke down these cuts .
the F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability only while a severe crisis , as it was in 2008 marking the first place , Adam S. Pos@@ en said a former member of the Committee for the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ bul@@ ences are not coming near to that level , he said .
&quot; it is certainly not to come into the situation in which she raised the fear of a interest rate because the markets are standing , &quot; said pos@@ es , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate , and not men@@ tioning the financial stability , and until it &apos;s been changed , I don &apos;t think it should take time ahead of time .

Bras@@ ili@@ ens pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande expands nutrition for healthy environments
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organisation SP@@ RS tried to clari@@ fy how important good food during the nurs@@ ing time . they do this with the presentation of images of babies , which are painted on breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates let@@ ting all the nutrients that they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ eting adaptation to the mothers .
a recent study under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women affects the genes of their babies , and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , un@@ healthy eating of the child can impact the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ k sports hall
the municipal administration Bern@@ ese approved the building agreement for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be a roof for the solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ desired turn@@ around at the Bern@@ rie@@ k sports grounds are step by step forward : in the recent general meeting , the revised construction project was blessed without large discussions .
previously , the panel had still made a request for the legal framework &quot; respect &quot; and the &quot; liberation &quot; of the valid plan .
with the exception &quot; exception &quot; it was permission to form a special form concerning the roof structure .
they are therefore to be an &quot; ar@@ tic@@ ulated roof with non @-@ ins@@ ist first and roof top . &quot;
the planning for planning is the planned use of roof area for solar plants : &quot; as a result , Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger stated as mayor of Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger &apos;s session .
at the Liberation of Liberation , for ener@@ g@@ ation , the roof @-@ b@@ aff@@ ection , which is made of energet@@ ic reasons , was prescribed by the plan of energet@@ ic reasons - below 10 degrees .
the volume of the hall will therefore be significantly reduced .
for this reason , a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because of the plan of the roof for an aff@@ ection to no &quot; exceptions . &quot; the Bern@@ rie@@ k Municipal Council generally goes without restrictions on the liberation orders .
there is no recur@@ ring project at the turn@@ around building : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym at the Sports Center is a community project of community and SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are registered at costs .
sub@@ sid@@ y are expected from school and cr@@ ater promotion .
in the next proce@@ eding section the request for the 18 x 36 meters of hall is now presented to the Land@@ mark and the inspection window .

triggered the switch the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of the foundation of the Medical Clinic , and now changes to a private practice close to the hospital .
in question , who shall follow the succession , came according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; who declared himself to take over leadership and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au starting on October 1 .
for the home in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in every case a &quot; appreci@@ ation &quot; and an broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist on pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in the internal station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board will coinci@@ de with his team , both houses until then the former year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ oll , which has more than 35 beds , will be closed permanently after nearly 140 years .
the district has thus planned for 2018 , when the current renovation at the hospital of W@@ eil@@ heim is completed .
en@@ code J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ors that under which the property is under the property of the Federal Cab@@ inet , where the property is to be used for asylum on asylum .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it goes with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several thoughts .
at present there is a short time care of the Car@@ itas and a tag@@ onal sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; what else could not happen to us , such an occasion did not come again , &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ o@@ asi &apos;s move to the Le@@ ch , who had been positi@@ vely charged by the employees &quot; positive and very under@@ stand@@ able . &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen has worked as chief physician for over 30 years , I haven &apos;t given it .
he had been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was closed in the past decades again and again closed with closure , departments were closed , for example the surgery and birth@@ days .

Jag@@ or@@ ating with two ver@@ side at Pr@@ at@@ au
two Tra@@ ctor drivers have been badly damaged during their ma@@ ize harvest@@ ing through stap@@ les in the afternoon .
during the super@@ st@@ ition on a ma@@ ize field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were used as the police hur@@ ried .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old men suffered severe injuries and were brought into hospitals .
but as it could happen to the accident we were initially un@@ clear .
the Cri@@ me police was established .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violence
a susp@@ icious organisation has led the police to the Lei@@ ks who had been on stream for 16 years from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
the twenty @-@ year @-@ old gave the 20 @-@ year @-@ old to have killed the young people and thrown her body into a channel in Rock@@ ef@@ ausen .
one of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate has fallen victims of violence .
the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ palast in Kaiserslau@@ tern , just as the public prosecutor and police arrested on Wednesday .
as a pro@@ di@@ ly Sus@@ p@@ ect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was to investigate the indication , agreed and investig@@ ators led to the place of the Lei@@ ks .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after it had not been agreed upon at home after a visit to a festival festival in Rock@@ ste@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman the investigations first launched on personal objects of the sacrifice .
there was a crime against the 20 year old when question@@ ing in the circle and friends of the volunte@@ ering firm .
the alleged off@@ ender introduced the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the glue was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities were to put to the 16 @-@ year @-@ old police who put the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the glue in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be led to the Haf@@ fun@@ nel on Wednesday and the investigations put him to a load .
a decision on closer circumstances of the fact that further investigations are to be carried out .
refugees arrive accommodations : study war@@ ns of housing
the situation on the German residential market is ke@@ en .
even more refugees seek for a paid lead .
the pressure on the housing market grows .
the social housing development is a challenge .
the distri@@ butions in the German residential market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and employment programs from the EU , more people are increasingly over@@ loaded on the market , which is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with income @-@ up citizens for the last paid apartments .
to cover the demand for paid apartments , 400,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
in this result , a study on behalf of the new social housing project &quot; Social Resi@@ dential Development &quot; was launched .
for comparison , in Germany there are 26@@ 0,000 units ready in Germany .
thereby 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees after the first three months of their stay is not obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a single establishment .
many of them go to the apartment house and lined up in the long p@@ ents before the apartment rentals .
according to the Federal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not limited to increasing refugees .
the study also provides significant contracts in the housing development policy of the last years .
Germany St@@ iev@@ es a property deficit before itself , which is to be greater from year to year .
in metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther has already been missing at the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals lived therefore in large cities in the rooms of WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the Hom@@ est@@ e@@ Market and voluntarily longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in big cities the number of square metres per capita has dropped from the last years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Resi@@ dential Development &quot; is a re@@ boot .
new incenti@@ ves to boost social housing development again .
the real estate tax could be ren@@ ounced and the property tax for sponsored apartments shall be suspended .
Moreover , according to the Alliance , an attractive tax @-@ depreciation is required .
the funding programme for refugee quot@@ ation Kf@@ W comes well now for cities and municipalities already well .
a good week after the start , on Monday evening , at 184 million euros , more than half of the costs were already called around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be raised .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia
practically there is practically no escape in Hungary , there is more and more refugees see the way about Croatia .
Zagreb announces that the trip is to be obtained via Slovenia into the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
dangerous is the route but nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring land of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Slovenian inner Minister , and when it &apos;s necessary we will organ@@ ise a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
according to the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees committed to Croatia to get to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television broadcast book .
Hungary had ab@@ ated its limit for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which entered into force the same day , will render us practically unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; they can go through , and we are preparing for this way . &quot;
those people are there , there are women , children and men who live and want to achieve something .
people , however , are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police seized the first refugees on the Serbian border in Croatia on the territory of Serbia .
most of the reported media reports from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they were both with the bus and tax@@ en in the Serbian border town S@@ ID .
immediately after her arrival , they tried to get to the green border after Croatia .
at the Croatian Serbian border , the refugees arrive beyond the border .
for this the border strip has other d@@ angers : there are still sharp mines in the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance now should quickly create a secure passage .
according to Hungary , after the closing of the border , there are hardly more refugees .
on Tuesday the police reck@@ on@@ ed 366 @-@ weighted people .
just before the short circuit on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws levels the over@@ coming and damage of the border with us as a crime .
in the South Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the convicted prisoners sentenced to five years and deportation in the country .
according to the immigration authority , one received a total of 94 asylum applications on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Trans@@ action &quot; border , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
under the applicants , 13 families with young children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees had stopped .
practically , however , nobody has granted a view to get granted asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the expired asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
in front of the &quot; Trans@@ action &quot; in Ho@@ ess , only a few hundred refugees assembled .
the workers began to re@@ build in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the litter which left tens of thousands of people over the past few weeks .
pl@@ ywood were dis@@ assembled and one of the im@@ pet@@ us in the bound@@ ary place was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express the objective of this building .
Austria is only few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
furthermore the country has reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 immig@@ rants took the country , however , in the country .
in Salzburg there are approximately 1400 people waiting for the trip to Germany .
train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning to the German authorities .
in 2016 there were regularly smaller groups of refugees too on by foot .
Mayor of &quot; Gest@@ ment@@ ary &quot; on the border
&quot; we were occupied in accordance with the bridge meeting on Sunday , when suddenly 10 people stood with travel vend@@ ors at the entrance of the tent , &quot; so W@@ ern@@ st@@ One Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler suddenly appeared .
tourists staying with the train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was sur@@ pris@@ ingly on Sunday but because of the refugee river with Austria sur@@ pris@@ ingly , the city was sur@@ pris@@ ingly in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; thus Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and worked together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars through the border to the near Pass@@ au .
previously we have opened the un@@ hop@@ eful guests once , including care and drink .
we said just , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; it was a matter of course , &quot; so a city at the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion .
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man didn &apos;t have to take up a donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we are very happy , &quot; says a city .
the pass @-@ pass passengers increased on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in a regional move towards Pass@@ au to move it after the short term that the rail traffic was discontinued after Germany but still trying to try over the border .
but the regional train was added to the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein on the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border was generally high in the course .
the bridge is linked to the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday afternoon , Sunday before a two bridge @-@ bridge - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the Vi@@ ktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends ten thousands of thousands to us , is a logical result of a apparently most holy policy :
rather than in the pension R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately ass@@ esses the erection of structures , our Federal Chancellor is up@@ un@@ official and publicly open the attitude of Hungarian government in the Dun@@ geon of National Soci@@ alism .
ly@@ rical evidence of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans that are now con@@ fron@@ ted in the regions with cha@@ otic condition .
the poultry farmers will also need to find out that the &quot; yellow land &quot; which she has been invited and welcome , nothing to be another refugee camp .
there will be a major challenge in view of the ongoing acqu@@ iring flows and the coming winter , with us de@@ cent states for vacc@@ ination ing@@ ents .
and there will be a larger one - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in the search for 35,000 w@@ inter@@ firm quartz
Konrad Adenauer has filled all hands with the refugee installation .
Christian Konrad is his business that his word has weight .
the government deployed the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to impos@@ e qu@@ arti@@ ce to thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the first quarter of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gained a grip in the hands .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a homeless &quot; in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the case of an &quot; k@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
in total , the Konrad pit has a total of 85@@ ,000 quartz animals in the he@@ fty year .
in order to fulfil the number , 35,000 accommodation will still be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 countries are to al@@ locate 15,000 of the federal states .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without the floor , &quot; &quot; Konrad .
with the national capit@@ alists , he has already led talks .
they had been rep@@ atri@@ ated to him even for the coming refugees qu@@ arti@@ c .
&quot; in Upper Austria it goes well &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ala is supported by Konrad .
there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christophe Schön@@ born , scheduled to be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
huge expectations does the asylum coordinator also work on the ORF promotion &quot; hel@@ mets . &quot;
we can offer individuals un@@ complicated set on the platform .
in addition , we hop@@ ed for hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er yesterday critic@@ ised the standards for &quot; accommodation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emergency times it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ cl@@ ature must comply with certain height of the hand @-@ holding inter@@ mitt@@ ance or the size of the upper .
for an temporary time , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply .
unlike the interior of the Interior , in contrast to the interior of successful ministry , Konrad Adenauer has developed with his experience .
I am an elder brother , who is not ignor@@ ant of the truth without any further .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er will not cause the Republic no cost as they declared themselves .
its workforce will increase it to three to four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ c search had not yet been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container on the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz in the office .
nevertheless there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
not only opening of municipal sports and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees to see the city Linz .
this is currently not necessary since we cannot accept the affected persons without these measures . Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) .
however , other locations can be tested for use in the emer@@ gen@@ cies .
critic@@ isms concerning the bas@@ aring in the division of the refugees in the federal state .
other districts have to aff@@ ord their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not rub@@ bed &quot;
in a longer conversation with the Bavarian Minister &apos;s premi@@ er Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ elli@@ inger ( VP ) has been de@@ pri@@ zed in the refugee quot@@ ation on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has provided me that the German borders are not ab@@ ated .
the tour of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany would be still possible .
however , there are now the bound@@ aries of the bound@@ aries .
special trains with refugees to Germany will not be there any more .
however , the safety seek@@ ers would however be transferred with regular breeding to Germany .
from the other EU @-@ countries , P@@ ag@@ inger once demanded more reinforced solidarity in the refugee quot@@ ation .
once Austria lead to its limits to controls , then Austria is a logical consequence , &quot; a logical consequence , &quot; from the approach of the Germans .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New C@@ row &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line has been officially completed .
four of the six floors of the office and manufacturing facility is the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) is to be hired to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in the IT , the cra@@ fty heads our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies in the new ship@@ yard , and later also to acquire .
S &amp; T wants to co@@ operate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot of things : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic site is just a question of time . &quot;
s &amp; T invested 1.7 million euros in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to one third of the city Linz , the Land Ober@@ öster@@ reich and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is on lease from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2700 square meter surface area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent it &apos;s in@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ ad opened second store in the Ark@@ cade
the new shop will be the focus of Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags in the new shop .
actually , Jutta Bre@@ ite wanted to take a dog .
this plan had to shor@@ ten the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni at the Tau@@ ben@@ market @-@ Ark@@ ade runner @-@ up : after all , she has now gained moment@@ um in the form of another branch .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop compared to the store , in which they sold different bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , all about ladies and wall@@ ets are available starting from € 75 .
large bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
had been re@@ mod@@ eled after several weeks .
&quot; but I think so long if I want to open a shop , &quot; says Bre@@ ite .
decisive for the decision was among others that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , by the idea of a private site , where only their hand@@ bags will be sold .
&quot; we are the only one in the Linz , which sell that brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who himself has Italian roots .
her fashion interest has gotten off Bre@@ it from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
me is the most noticeable thing when something developed and I can show new trends in current prices .
and why some woman at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in ornam@@ entation , may not answer the lady with the last security .
perhaps it &apos;s clear to get a nice p@@ ouch every out@@ fit .
the origin of the wine from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer family of Donald Tr@@ ump came from one place to be called the vill@@ agers .
this property also combines man@@ holes with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for exc@@ itement .
if he comments on an alien host@@ ilities for journalists , as repor@@ ters and knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential address is in shap@@ ing the campaign strong .
and cutting good .
this is also registered in the nurs@@ ing K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire .
the New York with the F@@ ili@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a term of many in the win@@ cer@@ dorf at the Wein@@ straße .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is over -@@ ty corners with him is turned .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in elec@@ toral campaign .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ tor Simone Wen@@ del rot@@ ates a film about dump .
what do the vill@@ agers then think about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow find something exciting , but they were not so @-@ amaz@@ ed in its kind of marriage , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed a unique documentary about the place and its famous Spr@@ inge , which alongside Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not for conf@@ ection@@ ate , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , too , with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would also live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the heart .
although there be respect for the performance of the family , but also tend the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a little Mo@@ or@@ ish , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
acci@@ dentally , the sur@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the Vic@@ inity , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; said : the makers , says it .
dump is found out of the village of the geber .
the Tr@@ ump &apos; success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather was in@@ mig@@ rated and opened in the USA a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate company were first property sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents were not free of tragedy : their wish to return to home in their home , failed to the Bavarian state in which the Palat@@ inate was back at that time .
he did not accept Tr@@ ump because he once was without homologation , the director of the Institute of pf@@ a@@ ean history and folk music , Roland Paul , had explained the film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rants . &quot;
that is in contrast to the follow @-@ up statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly stated that Mexican immig@@ rants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border dam to qu@@ it illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; as the pol@@ arity , this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant du@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a &quot; born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement will see the Americans , &quot; he is always about thousand . &quot;
do he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never has been w@@ alled by K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension industry in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions how man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter was men@@ tioning that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came with a visit something for the church organ which was generally well done .
&quot; I can not imagine that the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says . &quot;
they think it better if he did not get the choice , because &quot; he has such radic@@ als views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
if those that had been in the US at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like he , &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than it , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ os Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as the president ?
&quot; my President is not &quot; it &quot; says it .
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the pre@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ els Film , which has been inter@@ viewed for the Tr@@ ump long , have been 12 000 child @-@ singers , even in the USA awak@@ ened the interest .
the Upper Bavaria of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; in Germany .
from the hand of a vice @-@ president in the German Alpine Club , Ludwig bal@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park gave the award for soft tourism .
in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain boo@@ bs . &quot;
the neighbouring country is responsible for awarding the award of the award .
a &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; must be at the maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one @-@ fifth of its area must be designated as protective field .
seven &quot; s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson , according to Can@@ ber@@ ra , in order to report the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , does not have major shi@@ fts in the reviews for Today .
the Breakfast Show of Nine was broadcast@@ ed by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m has abolished the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sunrise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ ea , took place in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , also Dubai , New York , Niagara Falls and Cancun .
this down@@ side of the management was to play no part in Australian TV viewers , since sunrise on an average of 39@@ 7,000 spectators with five major cities , compared with Today 33@@ 9,000 .
Today was a slight increase on the rating for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
Today f@@ ails the gap in sunrise over the last few months .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
so far in September Sunrise at an average of 34@@ 9,000 spectators to 3@@ 14.000 employees in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the walls of the wall concern more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 Wör@@ ies with the former seri@@ ary of capture by the river Erik Thomson .
the new drama about a recently promised father , who en@@ closes himself with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached an impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million spectators .
critics were asked if Thomson was a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening did this with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; .
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and killed easily The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL Famil@@ ies ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results at evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 ) is the new Quiz @-@ Show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe on average 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ ump@@ ed on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot Seat ( 6@@ 13,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and during the second half an hour 7@@ 20,000 .
hot Seat on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the ratios of the second evening of The Chase Australia is to be confident that Hot Seat will eventually carry out at 17 : 30 .
the Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars which didn &apos;t managed to over@@ ride the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

Sam Wood holds his lips until the final on Thursday sealed
all three women have left in the ly@@ rical way , why wood is the perfect man and proclaimed his sense of humor , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner in .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive the last rose ? , &quot; could their answer to the game , who won the heart of the Bachel@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except ourselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ i &apos;s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible with me and I thought that &apos;s over the whole course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons &apos;s Fel@@ lows .
Sarah is on the ground with two feet on Earth , it makes so much fun to be with it , inserted Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that it and Sam Wood were suitable as a couple .
from their view@@ point , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the hom@@ e@@ visit came last week it clearly made that wood &quot; the One could be .
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I &apos;m already pre @-@ ten@@ ding to him , &quot; she said .
and when asked , if wood should choose , if not they were , then she was av@@ eng@@ ed .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is aired on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on the Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
in Detroit , Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams , that sent out after its impressive working day of last year en@@ quiries at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
some coach would have known Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a Ger@@ angel as it did the Aus@@ sie Rug@@ by League Con@@ vert@@ it in his first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband and gave them the next opportunity to a P@@ unt @-@ return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grin@@ d his ro@@ ok@@ ies ahead of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula harmon@@ ize Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ pole por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by speci@@ alt@@ e@@ ams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who ri@@ pped himself to forget his pat@@ inated fishing and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is pat@@ rolled in an unt that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian political tor@@ ship for his N@@ FL @-@ debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and told the playing field and told her Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not launch a wor@@ sen@@ ing start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; that was a thing that happens once , just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; he said , &quot; Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ward compared the s@@ itter with his Origin debut in 2007 when a pass conducted at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
in all , there was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
Hay@@ ne posed a photo with fans and continues an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ ag@@ ram .

&quot; as a result , we are not going to causes the causes , &quot; said free elec@@ tors of voters .
as soon as possible , asylum seek@@ ers want to susp@@ end the Free voters as soon as possible .
therefore , the Ai@@ j@@ amm@@ ers also asked more personal for administrative services that are responsible for asylum . &quot; we also need at least 50 new kinder@@ garten , &quot; said Ai@@ j@@ ger .
the FW @-@ Chef critic@@ ised that several states are not consistently al@@ loc@@ ating : &quot; we are a common standards of the Länder . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is moving away , others not &quot;
&quot; we need to be able to act . &quot;
but the country &apos;s cultural policy should not fall under the table .
a year long lasting from fatigue remains on the agenda : the image policy .

but the Ai@@ caravan is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G9 has to be accelerated , &quot; he said the FW @-@ Chef .

4 people killed after police officers attemp@@ ting to shoot clo@@ cks on protest@@ ers in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the South of Nepal , after demonstr@@ ating rubber in a human amount issued against the proposed new constitution , said the official at Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , whereby some of them have cast stones and bombs .
Mr Dh@@ ac@@ al said , the police was deployed to the air and thrown into the air , before they return to rubber in rubber .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber handles used , known from which it is known that they can kill , but they are traditionally used as a less dead@@ ly alternative , evi@@ d@@ ently a high fat@@ ality produced .
the conflict was the last in weeks violent protests in Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ h@@ esi say that new provinces created in the framework of the proposed new constitution , would decrease its political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that want to own a own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent disp@@ utes since the 10th .

the legisl@@ ature did not agree on certain cl@@ auses in the situations of Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into effect on Sunday .

Google launches double campaign donations to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc . ( goo@@ db@@ ye to Google Inc . ) announced a double @-@ fund campaign that aims to support 11 million $ for humanitarian organisations that have survived the thousands of refugees trying to flee the European nations because they flee from the war torn countries .
Google has an un@@ common personal approach to acquain@@ t@@ ance of donations in his blog .
instead of allowing a manager to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who fled with her family from Kabul , when she was seven years old , she had her personal experience .
&quot; along with our journey , many dark lines and bus runs , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and anxi@@ ety , &quot; wrote them .
I was lucky .
but since the refugee crisis has grown in Europe , many people are des@@ per@@ ate to des@@ per@@ ate people like my family .
donations are providing four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without limits , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations can be doubled up to $ 5.5 million to $ 11 million , to $ 11 million .
Europe is con@@ fron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely created by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; machining by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easily overweight diabet@@ ics can be helpful to weight loss .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years .
it is still too early to say if there are easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer than those who get non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study at J@@ ama .
weight loss surgical intervention or ob@@ ese surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to record food .
over the years , obes@@ ity operations have been efficiently v@@ ented for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most of studies were performed in people with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI about 30 are considered in ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1 . us a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have gathered in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obes@@ ity - gast@@ rop@@ ped and stomach lining up to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average number of people under@@ ne@@ ath this surgery decreased from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI of those who have non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments took approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes care was completely dissolved and at 28 % partial .
in the medi@@ cally safe group of the group , diabetes was fully attributable to diabetes by only one percent , and in part only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better seen in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ line &quot; in general for the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also supervised the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood glucose levels throughout the time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell by roughly 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; glyc@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mortality in five years , thus the director Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also lik@@ ened the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass @-@ surgery Group had lost more weight compared to the gast@@ ro@@ tom@@ y group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and pe@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and previously reported a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study showed no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , Black@@ stone tells of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was better in ob@@ ese people who underwent a Adi@@ pos@@ itas &apos; surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that experim@@ ented with conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was relaxing for people with a BMI among 35 who are interested in the process .
&quot; it is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this bottom BMI @-@ group &quot; without an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that humans and their doctors should begin to take weight as soon as the patient lies with a BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting for a long time until we take people to take this serious , &quot; she said .
I think once they have gathered the genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a recur@@ ring is really hard . &quot;
love story is playing in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
it is a theme that is currently increasingly popular in the Bell@@ et@@ rist@@ ik . a young woman , at school times remains un@@ popular and un@@ mist@@ ak@@ ably , meets the sk@@ ies of her adolesc@@ ence after years , and this remains in love with her .
even in the recently published novel &quot; O@@ acci@@ dentally we are not as &quot; from Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
in addition to its love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ &apos;s readers , because he plays in Lang@@ we@@ iler and the surrounding settlements .

&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not handle all refugees , the Dalai Lama said he added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East rose .
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders ur@@ ged them to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama said the problem of the continuous refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the inauguration of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which dedicated eth@@ ics studies .
he called for the interests of the interests of the individual nations or even continents under the given conditions .
he also emphas@@ ized that the response of the West European countries on the refugee crisis must be ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not reasonable .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama &apos;s and Austria ple@@ dged to praise the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , this is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , how real peace and real development , mainly through education , can be created for these Muslim countries . &quot;
in the end of all , we have to think about how the killing in her countries is decreased .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never resolved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama said the problem of the violence and commented about George Bus@@ hs to the terrorist bombing of September 11 and exhibited that the violent reaction of the USA went into a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my side dish in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know , his moti@@ fs were good , but he replaced violence , and that was unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
4 @-@ fold increase of deliver@@ able disinfection products by children in the past 4 years
tox@@ ic@@ ation centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve that suggest strongly alcoholic craft @-@ ready so@@ cks , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the time increased by hand detection in children under the age of 12 , using tox@@ ic@@ ation centres reports , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly frequent in those products , and unfortunately there will be a percentage of them in the emergency exit , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children of disinfect@@ ants are drunk safely , while some are doing to im@@ press her friends or because of a mut@@ ation with the social media .
show videos on YouTube , such as you@@ ths smoke only because of a budget Experience .
yo@@ ungst@@ ers have ming@@ led disinfect@@ ant with alcohol content water to get a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be hired by attractive de@@ fle@@ ets of disinfect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand disinfect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ked .
there are disinfect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange du@@ v@@ ings that are very attractive for children .
the disinfection products contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with infants , few syr@@ ing@@ es can lead to alcohol po@@ is@@ oning already .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ e@@ Call Center in the Hospital of Kansas , the transmitter Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would not let us enc@@ ir@@ cle Whis@@ ky , but people let this hand disinfect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who has been taken up four syr@@ ing@@ es from the straw@@ berry smell compound in the school , has been brought into an emergency shot during the treatment .
her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is drunk by an adult in law , told Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency call doctor who had covered them in the G@@ win@@ net Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah started her words and was not able to go to her when she arrived in the not@@ ation .
doctors transferred them over night in a separate nurs@@ ery home on the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , because the girl fallen off the alcohol and had fallen down the head , said R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers recommended to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinfection products outside the child &apos;s reach .
about alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , some disinfect@@ ants were connected to death cases .
in 2013 , two women were killed in Ontario women according to the im@@ pregn@@ ating disinfection products which contained a toxic , non @-@ clear@@ er ingredient .
the employee of healthcare authorities suggest that the product Me@@ thanol contained a dead@@ ly solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , active as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in New York State were po@@ is@@ oned to po@@ is@@ oned up their &quot; m@@ ist &quot; teacher by sending an anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says it a police report .

D@@ eil@@ a said : &quot; Cel@@ tic already had bad times , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry , or sad about what happens .
we feel this very well - but we need to go on .
we really need to really take the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better .
now it is so important .

the players that come in the summer have come to in@@ corporate this pre@@ season to get what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by using unnecessary players to add what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while increasing in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July in the period from May to July in the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period of 10.000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
the North German unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was 5.5 per cent above the rate of U@@ K@@ s , as the figures reported for National Statistics ( dating only ) .
in the meantime , employment fell in Scotland around 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent during the quarter - a figure over the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the newest numbers and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have witnessed a further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and unemployment .

why I will be a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except during a late &apos; intervention , I will see how a man will be put to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a viewer &apos;s g@@ ellery in the chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is expressed by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first mentioned in January for the first time in January , and although I was sho@@ cked to agree .
when the day was come , I began to fear me .
so , why should I do it ?
I agree , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell all the story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications for places available , a ma@@ ke@@ en lot@@ tery took place to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who will be selected , who will make it emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit alongside Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the course of the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to accept a not@@ ep@@ ad and a pen to record what I see .
I just need to try to remind me of all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of having lost my party to Twitter .
this is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , just as he wants to and you will have access .
I compl@@ ained about it .
they were dre@@ aming that &quot; it could have much better form@@ ulate , &quot; but they still think that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me anytime from his list of witnesses .
but he wants to be an international repor@@ ter here to write there .
if he dies , he th@@ inks that the public relations work will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , one repor@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the po@@ d@@ casts feature , which I did .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details .
I can &apos;t say that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would not guilty to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I think there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of the murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I think that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be real objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn back .
what you &apos;ll get away from me is what it means to die a man of unnecessary death .
man named after mo@@ ist police ret@@ aining @-@ hunt , coming from the C@@ anning River

an attempt to impos@@ e a man of Perth , was un@@ successful when he found himself in the sh@@ ackl@@ ed and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
C@@ anning V@@ ale was founded on Tuesday into a house peaceful strike in Beck@@ bu@@ den on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , this was trying to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not too much .

Peter Moody claimed that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to cut it off and threat@@ ens to end the racing
Peter Moody claimed that st@@ ew@@ ards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his stack and threatened to qu@@ it the race immediately .
he wanted to st@@ ew@@ ards the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race @-@ day treatment , the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday , carried out .
Moody &apos;s Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions , when it came to explain the positive co@@ b@@ alt @-@ t@@ amp@@ on sample in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had been kept for 18 months because of sp@@ y @-@ pro@@ claims and didn &apos;t want it to see how too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing about it , and I have eaten it long on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out all at once , &quot; by Moody .
they know that there was far@@ ther .
sometimes they re@@ acts , and I have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it as I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to down@@ turn high , and I would like to think my owners that I try to try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I do that , then I should not be more coach .
then I need to consider what I do with my license .
previously , Moody had announced the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ebi@@ ing.com , leaving the integrity department in his barn .
&quot; 18 months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will appoint - and give him a job in my st@@ ables , to give information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moody on Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that &apos;s the case , they should certainly gra@@ b their n@@ oses because they have failed to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of Route L , David Moo@@ g , current President of Route L , Bernard Sa@@ un@@ dry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of the time and today is still aware of it .
should I bring it to the view that it personally will be personally ?
does Route L would fail to end@@ ure and perhaps people out of train@@ ers responsible for doing what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the business ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people are thinking out there , I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and off , and I have no doubt that what I say you can think about it now .
but I &apos;m at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and this makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert the pressure on them and push it down to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ str@@ ations of the Train@@ ers have built up with the long lasting co@@ b@@ alt @-@ investigation on Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching did so that he could throw out his license on the table . &quot;
Moody , best known through its preparation of the free master@@ pieces Black C@@ avi@@ ar , awarded the race course treatment rule , &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , after a package of mud or sound have been dra@@ fted to the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of motorsport .
I have to take over full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my staff was ab@@ oun@@ ded on the leg on the leg .
yesterday evening could be so .
yesterday , it could have been the whole day yesterday , so it was so .
but it was so on the race day .
Moody could con@@ fron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package at race day . a study of this issue was opened .
it is a joke .
people who establish these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all look forward that we need regulations , but here &apos;s to far &quot; , Moody &apos;s .

Melbourne &apos;s Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals for claims to fight
Melbourne &apos;s Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ises the Tac@@ tag@@ er of his player as &quot; Agenda set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the tournaments will run the Storm player &quot; ring games &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ cely al note to the Storm Team , after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; pattern example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land not &quot; to be good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that she is concentr@@ ating solely on their own &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading train@@ ers in his team are confident , as it might seem to worry about the Storm Team to be defeated .
&quot; it &apos;s always back - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson informed about the fight , she said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed all year in our def@@ ensive system or techniques . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and this has been awarded for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he &apos;s probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is already funny as it appears again at this season .
Bell@@ aria has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and its ment@@ or reminds us that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; durable &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he was compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George became a long @-@ time team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a she@@ ath .
but now he has a team that can play and which we are as exciting , in particular his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as those .
I develop stronger trust because they say these things , because they &apos;re a bit wor@@ ried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they did not think about it as it went about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy pointed out that the Storm match against Roo@@ sters has got a higher result than the match of Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not make any points to the voltage ?
for me , it is the sched@@ ules .
if they relate to us , it means that we will continue to meet them in one phase .
the Storm Team has passed away this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin the next morning tomorrow .
Serbia with 200,000 $ deposit con@@ current to Drug Ad@@ ver@@ age
a man , possibly a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence could escape to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were lubric@@ ated to Que@@ ens@@ land , was freed from a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the French police discovered 100 kg of the drug on yacht solo , who arrived in South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and transferred in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he found his co @-@ accused in the marina in the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police discovered 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for an attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the attor@@ ney of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café , could have been a harm@@ less reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the threat of polic@@ emen of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the Tribunal on Wednesday .
in the case of the prison , he lied on the police on his position .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics Mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 in cooperation to meet his release .
&quot; after reading the ei@@ st@@ ately explanations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a $ 200,000 people represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Justice Flan@@ agan .
but that alone will not be sufficient to hold it , not appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released from b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and Serb Pass on a daily basis and is holding an inter@@ lock at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

the prosecutor &apos;s attor@@ ney in Eil@@ id@@ h Robertson told the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ dic@@ tive to fri@@ gh@@ tened people .
he gave us that the sear@@ ches were done on the computer from him , but said that it was done , because he said that he was saying to be a polic@@ emen to fri@@ gh@@ tened pain .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent the images and he asked to send more photos .
he said that he did it to attract them .
he said , He is sick of the head when he drinks , and he said that he would then see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson said : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother , and was weeping and weeping .
she also saw un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able pictures on the phone and con@@ fron@@ ted the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and told that the accused computers and Play@@ station used to speak with girls who saw a lot younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pleaded not guilty to the indictment , non @-@ permanent paintings of children on 14 June last year , to have been cast off against the laws and not before court appearance on 24 March this year .

the Mass Mak@@ es : every two years show the car at the IAA show its innovations .
in 2015 , especially the movement for the compact cars , which is currently particularly well used .
cars from the compact class are currently a special demand : around 28@@ .1 percent of new registrations accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August to this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Show from September 17 to 27 ) .
many new compact models will be presented in this year between all of the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the largest premier@@ es for the German high@@ s is the Opel Astra which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann on the fair .
he belongs to the core of the brand .
the new Astra is also well @-@ sold , too , but the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
Opel presents a entry level below the largest compet@@ itor VW Golf in the view , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will be priced at Euro 16 990 .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen State and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp are also available , which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike its main compet@@ itor , Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only one @-@ five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the Spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
and what about the Astra at the IAA is still driving on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra &apos;s competitors in the race .
the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only one @-@ fifth of a five @-@ door weighing in conventional and a sporty GT version .
at the beginning of next year , it will be available as a station wagon in the beginning of next year .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan de@@ pot wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .

the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .

at the IAA in the compact class , there are a series of over@@ processing and new variants like the flush @-@ mounted Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are in@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Federal Coun@@ cill@@ or Te@@ gel to be housed in a small cell for months in months .
because of the injury of their human dig@@ nity , in@@ mates were generally entitled to compens@@ ate for financial compensation when they are accommodated in too small cells .
this decision was adopted by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the data subject may also hope for money , if they were imprisoned only a few days in the locked rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ in@@ mate was successful in Karlsruhe with the constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe . he was accommodated in an individual cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who has already been laid down on foot after his death , was laid on by a larger cell .
his term of liability due to the dis@@ claim@@ ers against the Land Berlin is failed .
but the constitutional rec@@ ti@@ fiers took up the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of the Berlin and instructed the case to renew the trial there .
they see the human dig@@ nity of man viol@@ ated the man .
Chamber of Kammer@@ decides on the amount of the compensation
even if legal reasons of legal grounds ask for a few days of adh@@ esion for the compensation , there was also a compensation , called it .
otherwise , &quot; a v@@ ature of the right protection of personality is to fear . &quot;
the Chamber &apos;s Chamber must now clari@@ fy the amount of money compensation .
the constitutional aid has often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they said first in April , one of the det@@ ain@@ ees of damages , because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
it is said to have a decision by 2011 that has the multiple occupancy of one cell without a separate toilet .
in addition , in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Court of Berlin confirmed that of a det@@ ain@@ able lodging in November 2009 , which det@@ ested by a det@@ ain@@ ee in one of the det@@ ain@@ ees .
the then mon@@ pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff then lived for three months a day from 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Car@@ rier .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to head@@ lines in the last weeks due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included again 23 hours , increasing the aggressi@@ vity . it should be said because of the most stressed areas .
according to information of the judicial authorities , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of young cyclists , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of Finance , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany , according to the statement of Vice Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , in Germany , is able to record one million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I tell you again and again : &quot; we can do it , and we can do it . &quot;
what to happen in Germany , gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 3@@ 50000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Labour ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el @-@ Institute ) apartments are the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but especially with affordable rental objects : from 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments from the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees so@@ jour@@ ned .
Federal Minister for Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) intends to double the funding , from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
a lot too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments have to be erected a year and would have to invest a grant amounting to 6.4 billion per year .
scientists and Federal State Minister informed that there are also more tax advantages of investment in housing development in addition to further tax advantages .
according to estimates of the Institute for Employment Research and Voc@@ ational Research , 55 per cent of the ge@@ ared men in Germany can be employed .
however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked after their qualification to help them with Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation of the recording group , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of the immig@@ rants , says the migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , Germany has issued a political change : the ban of refugees for refugees in recognition of work .
while there was a banned ban for asylum seek@@ ers for up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the resi@@ den@@ ces that will be restricted to a place of residence .
the society also itself in society - even because of the professionals of professionals , in order to have consistently placed the vision of the access to the labour market .
the large hur@@ dle in access to the job market is missing German knowledge .
so far there is no correc@@ ting offer of general and professional @-@ related voice lessons .
research also shows that jobs are most common through personal contacts .
therefore , the structure of networks is therefore right in the view of thr@@ ott@@ hardt from the Royal Path to work integration .
the Berlin school administration found that only few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the kit@@ es , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oted parents , it is only once a very important to keep the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ js , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate department .
to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in different languages .
if the need for educational events strongly increase by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - about by taking more technical colle@@ ges .
in the countries , students without German welcome will be prepared on the classes .
but they are not always taught by trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of evidence , Be@@ ate St@@ ations of Berlin School administration .
the German Student werk estimates that some 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
prin@@ cip@@ ally , no federal government of asylum seek@@ ers or commem@@ oration of the study - the only exception was to be present in Berlin , the In@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its position .
• In addition , refugees could be facilit@@ ated by the university .
for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce does not receive any services following the application of asylum . if they begin studying .
the latter , in principle no B@@ af@@ o@@ g , since they are not falling under the circles of the b@@ af@@ ast .
to date , Ged@@ ul@@ ant refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ eligible , from 1 January 2016 , this span had been shortened to 15 months .
however , this financing costs must also be closed , so Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German student union .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
in future , Islam will play a major role in future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many are the religion important part of their identity .
the state should gradually develop the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to develop the existing state @-@ churches right to a new state @-@ religi@@ ons of relationship .
it would also be important that the establishment of a Islamic welfare state , which takes care profession@@ ally around the new@@ com@@ ers .
rights are also duties .
so the representatives of Islam must be on clear contact with some and ready to assemble the state in many areas and to finish certain control options .
it also belongs to the read@@ iness to sei@@ ze against religious foundations .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced the concern and religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to play those conflicts in Germany would immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
soon he suggested to translate the Basic Law of Arabic .
in future , integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society today .
this will also set the majority society to change the degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
although , Germany - as a result of European decisions - since a more than decade , a anti @-@ discrimination laboratory and a General Gender Equality Act .
but it became very slow how the NSU @-@ series show , in which police and authorities have igno@@ red the r@@ assi@@ c motif .
equal opportunities for all : what Mig@@ rant organisations and advoc@@ acy groups of non @-@ white German citizens already under@@ take refuge in the next few years , if the country has to stay peace@@ fully and their new citizens and citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
General rule was to be able to supply the previously expected refugees to have been medical doctors , by the doctors president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; regarding Man@@ or Power and Capacities , we make it , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , extra money must flow into it .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery invites all the call to assist with registration heal@@ ings .
services could be expected later by the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly frag@@ able , so many people with the limited power catalog they look forward to seeing the asylum application law .
otherwise , the doctors make all the language barri@@ ers to create .
even until now , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practice , interpre@@ ting costs , calls upon them .
many refugees too have been helped with more gener@@ medical centers for ambul@@ ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are much more in@@ treated people under refugee camps , and with the yo@@ ungst@@ ers go about HIV en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
but with some other cases , German doctors come from their training but clearly , Mont@@ gom@@ ery believes .
&quot; paras@@ ite fall or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; and for the state of the doctors , it is possible through the refugees even alle@@ vi@@ able in sight .
the Syrians had a highly developed educational system , some refugees even doctors .
in order to be pract@@ ised , however , they would have to prove their qualification and bl@@ ur@@ red insp@@ ections .
at least half of refugees in Germany , according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) , psych@@ ically ill : most of the suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic disorder or depression .
particularly against any refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study published by the TU München in Munich occupies that each fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ matic in Germany .
those who have a post @-@ trau@@ matic regulation is suffering from trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting , amongst others , Flash@@ back with breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ aces and death .
other symptoms are ins@@ om@@ nia and concentr@@ ating distur@@ b@@ ance , strong fe@@ ar@@ fulness and emotional di@@ stra@@ dness .
in order to prevent symptoms that symptoms would be chronic , a early treatment was necessary , as Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have reci@@ eved a psycho@@ therapy .
indeed , psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can put on request in the social care for a psycho@@ therapy , but the processing usually lasts several months .
in addition , most medical workers or doctors who have not been trained for mental illness would be advised to decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
these often lead to patches with false ass@@ ess@@ ments , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; the cir@@ cus promot@@ er falls on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the objective is to draw any age group in the B@@ ann of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atic , animal and s@@ uns@@ ate entertainment .
now the cir@@ cus promot@@ est invites to the arena in the tiles .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can not imagine , live without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ine .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the actual property placement .
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family for more than 33 years .
so the gift to the enthusi@@ astic lies the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ resses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ine .
&quot; property &quot; cocktail at world @-@ fl@@ air , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst .
with 50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometers long tour this fl@@ air can now experience .
the Cir@@ cus program convinces with talented artists from around the world .
awarded the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm .
even the Castillo Brothers also understand the crafts@@ manship .
with the heroes of the Stum@@ m@@ films there wants to record the Cub@@ an Duo .
light@@ ness and exercise - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art in the mast is to conquer the storm at the storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ts the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus are also fascin@@ ated by their finger@@ tips and joint activity .
using the un@@ icycle on a ball to balance ?
for He Yuan no problem .
sn@@ ake sn@@ ake and sn@@ ails at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little ones and fascin@@ ates by their mobility .
60 employees from twelve countries offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ izes Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
disp@@ utes within the attitude of cir@@ cus are only very often the topic of various animal protection organisations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst stand in this position : &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it is too good for us . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy any cancellation unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; how they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read from the eyes after the possibility of every wish .
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
it does not feel well , nor does it take to the ring .
the most important commandment is : good for the animals .
specifically to their Zeb@@ ra Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a fer@@ rite pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra@@ st@@ mare is the family pro@@ bst proud of .
the two animals lived together for eight years in a secret and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was born , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
although the Zeb@@ ro@@ id is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus au@@ bst .
there is something to be there for every visitor .
&quot; one is safe , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and with all your heart . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe holds false speech in the parliament
Mr Mug@@ abe , el@@ dest leader of Africa , was the leading stairs in the beginning of the year .
it remained un@@ har@@ med , but the case of the case spread rapidly across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament also was authorized by the opposition of the opposition that they had received anonymous death thre@@ ats and had warned them to accompany the address by Mr Mug@@ abe with Bu@@ h@@ call .
last month they hat@@ ched him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech made on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the democratic transition ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions @-@ politicians received SMS messages to their phones that they warned , Mr. Mug@@ ab@@ es response to interference .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it declared the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists in Mug@@ ab@@ i &apos;s speech .
she considers the Members of the Parliament to termin@@ ate the immun@@ ity in the parliament , and once they leave the parliament , parliamentary immun@@ ity is no more effective .
the teacher advoc@@ ate , that by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , is &quot; concerned , &quot; about the haz@@ ards for the politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard grows up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of re@@ structured and saving efforts .
hp will split up later this year into two listed companies and to separate the computer and printer business of its faster growing company hardware and its service operations .
the expected deficit reduction leads to a load of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ men and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unity after the separation .
Hew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise becomes smaller and stronger than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ening portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and is expected to be concentr@@ ating , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; thus an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company which was founded in the 19@@ 30@@ ies by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , &quot; which has called the &quot; birth@@ place of Sil@@ icon Valley &quot; .

HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers , and one of the largest U.S. tech companies worldwide , is the latest in this area that is based on the convic@@ tion that closely focused businesses a better performance .
FC Play Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates will be competing with the game at Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
W@@ enger sent over Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation after plan runs , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario would already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games in England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly not yet un@@ certain .
the big confusion in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had sh@@ un the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ le injury and then returned to its old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury was threatened not the career , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bone that has not healed well .
this is no larger matter .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in connection with its an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as W@@ enger also recognized , there is the corresponding danger of other injuries , always if a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it is also developed an agre@@ eable pattern .
the study of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd sets 23 different ill@@ nesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
it played in only 65 out of Ar@@ sen@@ as 157 pixel players in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for ar@@ senal is that in six out of eight different playing times since 2007 @-@ 08 , one of the two Premier League Clubs were to list the most vulner@@ ability positions .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ie but Arsenal &apos;s that an improvement in the level of injuries throughout the last season will continue .
&quot; sometimes if you return from a breach , you have an acci@@ dental period of time in which you need to strengthen your body and fight it , &quot; said W@@ enger .
jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he earns .
Arsenal will kick off his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening at Din@@ amo Zagreb on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane next Wednesday , and W@@ enger will press an press within the team .
H@@ é@@ na Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled not to Croatia , this means that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will not be able to start .
W@@ enger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ on Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud ( instead of Nach@@ o mon@@ y and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to maintain a balance and players who need it , a little break down , &quot; said W@@ enger .
even though Arsenal had clear favorites through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Park of Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with their biggest en@@ for@@ cing effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; unbe@@ atable &quot; campaign started in the final season .
the stadium was struck on Tuesday evening by an earthquake ; at the Richter scale 3.2 were measured .
this year it was 10th of Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the teaching from the past season with Champions League &apos;s surrender to Monaco and remains driven by far hope to lead the association into his first European triumph .
&quot; this drive is immen@@ sely , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it never didn &apos;t work with ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship : the com@@ edy show that grants us serious accounts on men &apos;s friends
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to the need for men to open up , now even more dou@@ bt@@ less than ever before , as well as self @-@ aging amongst young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there remain three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ se ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a her@@ ed@@ itary life ) in 2015 considered the year of a man with the goal of preparing culture in question to seek the men if they need these .
friendship is the heart of the heart in order to master this challenge .
a current study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ press@@ ant symptoms determined that if the l@@ ender had a suff@@ iciently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of com@@ es@@ ying are doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritu@@ ally healthy friends pos@@ es the risks of mental problems .
but of course , one must have friends even , that a friendship can work out .
in the age of social media guided communication with its main focus on substance , the in@@ ability of the response is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , life fun and successfully appear , even if the isolation is dominated .
this su@@ perf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists will name ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values ; money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire declared recently , money can really buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focusing on the head was placed .
its character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , it sh@@ one by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers common UV mar@@ ches , Mom@@ ents at football gu@@ ises in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire from Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can refer to any case , even if they often stay back to explore fully their feelings .
as a staff of the phone number he explained to me : ... &quot; my audi@@ oph@@ ones for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ anger@@ ed me , indeed , how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends .
the old Re@@ de@@ cent &quot; I therefore come righ@@ tly &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness there , when people are talking about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to provide long @-@ term growth mechanisms .
it presents very clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so , my objective of objective view on the phone number the people in eye view of desp@@ air can also help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you sit on this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship with which for celebration of the day completely redesigned l@@ isse , why don &apos;t they take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better when you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone only , give him a smile and say you to H@@ ello .
one never know , which difference could be your friendship .
friends will be broadcast in Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 236 episodes - for the 4@@ Friend@@ ship Fest
di Maria meets , to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malmö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani for his suitable matches on Malmö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani stopped course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ cen@@ sored stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met in less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player , which brought the French champion to the way before they finally missed their lead when Cav@@ ani scored one scal@@ p in the 6@@ 1. minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A takes a strong start against the Swedish Master , since it does not only take the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to quarter fin@@ ishers in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got their points , there was no class example of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics missed chances in front of his home @-@ home team and against the club , which he began his lively career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win home or back@@ ward in the Champions League . thus it &apos;s a good start to create and relaxed problems , even if there are certain things we need to have been perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; it is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I have regre@@ t@@ ted that we had not yet another one or two other goals . &quot;
Jud@@ gement him@@ ovic returned to the Paris team after his violation of three changes to the Paris @-@ Team which was holding 2 : 2 Bel@@ voted on their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but was em@@ itted by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argentin@@ ian gli@@ der was designated as the man called PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he ran in the last month of Manchester United . by the time he ran in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö defense , before he completed the Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the grid .
however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would attain a big win , he was dis@@ appointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off hit to hit these stage , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and had a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle field a severe opponent .
but except a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who participated in Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s tips in the 34@@ th minute , they offered a little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself up , with some mis@@ ses and bad results , not least from Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was not less than five trials in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani was used after a re@@ boot .
nevertheless he showed a much more skill when he added his co @-@ players in the game , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , which was turned into a shooting incident at the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second goal was finally shortly after the hours @-@ mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus scored his sixth part of the season , after confir@@ ming the Max@@ well flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this finished all thoughts that Malmö opposite the game could come back and only an excellent input of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result in a gate just before substitute of the E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi possible at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave us later that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian asked : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fications are not enough . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

in the year earlier , they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tiger stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to its role as a spo@@ iler , played this part as a perfect match against the Minnesota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the Twin@@ s stri@@ pped a chance to climb into a game half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card ranking .
for Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ Word , which was so difficult about a large part of the second half of the season so difficult .
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; says Tig@@ ers Manager Brad P@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon beha@@ ved his early offensive support as Detroit &apos;s first two points in their first two weeks , then once in the sixth , and then once again in ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) performed 6 times in the 1 / 3 in@@ ings and allowed three rings .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; Simon , he said .
it is difficult to throw in the bul@@ l@@ do@@ z@@ le of each game and therefore I want to go completely into the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , the first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ man @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Mar@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he did well shav@@ ed the bu@@ si@@ wood , &quot; he said .
he looked good at ( stroke training ) , looked much better in the bul@@ l@@ do@@ z@@ ers , and he brought it right into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the rear end of the seventh day , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double in the left field line .
the Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks was a colorful , and Simon presented his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by lin@@ k@@ gun Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y .
the really running wall , the only man who was con@@ fron@@ ted with whom he became con@@ fron@@ ted before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who turned the right @-@ run , Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen .
with a pair of buyers and the finishing run , Dec@@ h@@ agen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ cher to a Double Play .
it was the major league &apos;s 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a Double Play .
after Detroit added an Insurance Run in the end of the ninth point , the wall made a R@@ B@@ I double against the C@@ loser of the tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don , winning the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right stand , however , S@@ ano will save three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit prof@@ ited at the start of the game by a still not event@@ ful P@@ hil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; the first two are yesterday in the veter@@ ans of the veter@@ ans who were canc@@ eled against the game of injuries for more than one month due to a back @-@ s@@ ling .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wish I desired , &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; but I felt glad when I felt and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ush@@ es gave a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ ner .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the qu@@ ins in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Club Castell@@ anos followed with a single in the right @-@ hand side , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third which the threat .
the tig@@ ers laid down in the second , achieved a one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s Manager Paul Mol@@ itor who said .
he has not sm@@ itten especially well , but he was sm@@ itten the right spot .
Hug@@ hes was found in a pitch @-@ count , but scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reli@@ ant Pro@@ sh@@ ish A.@@ J.@@ L. .
four R@@ uns were joined by Hug@@ hes on six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
note : tiger &apos;s R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ chez was divided for a violation of the wor@@ shipping .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay on his slim line is often rather broken away from them .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
the exotic fruit are still healthy : in them , B @-@ vitamins and the vitamins E and C. The Mang@@ os contain many vitamins A and the pre @-@ press beta Carot@@ in .
therefore , who eat the fruits , assi@@ sting the body , the immune system and met@@ abolic processes throughout the body .
when you buy , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or have a pleasant smell of it .
the shell colour only says nothing about it , as ripe is the fruit - so you can also taste green man@@ gan@@ os very delicious .
they store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet food .
a man@@ go gives also a heart@@ y dishes a special touch .

almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of town , Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been added to the name of the German Re@@ unification in the park on Wednesday .
in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an from the Reformation &quot; at the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .

Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants were often observed in the town of the Pop@@ es of centuries for centuries , only in secret its faith .
the place is visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed as young August@@ ine mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .

hammer Artist invested 3 years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works created by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ id has written the introduction and ex@@ bi@@ ble texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now has appeared with magnificent images .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ ves .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means is syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the respective topics can be changed which can be quite dark .
about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his own Bible for which he made a sub@@ jective and artistic selection from the many different themes of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
of course , cycles that dev@@ ote themselves such as St@@ ations , pl@@ agues , ceremonies , or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
therefore , he fascin@@ ates the spont@@ ane@@ ously several partners : this applies to the Luther Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation just as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and this is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ id , who has set apart the basis of painting with their respective Bible verses .
he interpreted the Bible verses from Ot@@ mar Alt and interpreted it into a look at the actual cent@@ ur@@ ings . &quot;
these texts are like the h@@ yst@@ er@@ ical mirror of Al@@ ts Painting .
they are nestled between the original Bible school of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jewelry set has gold letters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old makes twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions had ultimately became a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ d Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I tried to try that , in order to bear me again with the Lord their father . &quot;
his second concern is to help the art in fast lasting time again : &quot; the perception of images are min@@ ted nowadays by records , and they are no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is ou@@ sted .
artists have a different desire and desire to show things .
images have always something hidden and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard I am a din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to have the viewer in the pictures , &quot; let them cover themselves , discover and feel what they will have : &quot; the picture se@@ eks to his face . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ rust had been given the presentation of &quot; Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst &quot; in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &quot; which has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst &quot; : &quot; I like how he under@@ stands his pictures . &quot;
I have not noticed that the Bible must be completely noted , but also selected for him , also mysterious topics .
&quot; that was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text was explained : &quot; this was a picture of the pictures .
this work is an invitation to &quot; his life to deep@@ en and freedom for Hans M@@ öhler from Luther &apos;s Verlag . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for M@@ öhler both ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - is being presented for the first time in an exhibition taking place at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15 .

Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants a pione@@ ering role in Germany
according to the will of the federal government , Germany is to be on the change of the cars of technological adv@@ ances .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which sees additional investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday at the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA in Frankfurt on the edge of the &quot; new Mobility Age . &quot;
the automated and networked drive will raise the traffic safety and provide less pet@@ itions , Do@@ brin@@ dt was said .
he wants to discuss the subject also with his counter@@ part , from the G7 states , who come together with representatives of the industry .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport has emphas@@ ised among other things the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and a way to digital radio stations .
for testing new technology , there is currently a test route on highway 9 in Bavaria .
in order to give the driver &quot; no additional adher@@ ence to the German government , &quot; the federal government plans to review the legal framework &quot; and where necessary to adjust to the new developments . &quot;
thus , Germany would like to use itself internationally that the permissible top speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers / h is raised .
Moreover , the Federal Government is also planning to use a change in the Vienna Convention which is previously reserved for people as a driver .
when automated driving takes over , the car will take the guide , the driver will become more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process the data in a matter of seconds .
based on the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible to high@@ ways by 2020 .
nevertheless , passenger cars are not expected to expect in public roads &quot; until 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 will be around 8.4 billion euros by 2025 .
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ c@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD traffic shar@@ ehol@@ ding S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol .
the question of liability for accidents and security of personal data of the driver must be clari@@ fied clearly .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars see sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than the French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA @-@ specified survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the D@@ EK@@ RA study comes to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent of them believe not at all , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surveyed by 2025 are estimated with aut@@ om driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
in Germany , the drivers in Germany are not willing to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
according to a survey by the B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent would agree that control during the entire drive will be down on all streets .
on the highway , traffic could present at least 15 percent in continuous traffic , rising by 45 per cent .
a good blind would leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;

&quot; we are strong enough to get to the title without Timo , &quot; said federal coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM course in Düsseldorf .
B@@ oll was at this point on the flight to a long term agreed spon@@ sor@@ ment in China .

Gaul@@ tier feels become old for a enf@@ ant .
it is a mix of quite a big fashion show and a W@@ ax @-@ aw@@ bone mar@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the main highlights : sho@@ cking man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which seem to be even deser@@ ted thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they carry the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , amongst others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits , to the big star in the fashion scene - and thus that he put men into coats .
&quot; I can &apos;t say nothing that I &apos;m the enf@@ ant of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was very light , &quot; it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the office , to the cat@@ walk ) , who is to see from the 18th September at the Kunsth@@ alle the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , is a fortun@@ ate that the fashion maker has changed its first post@@ ure attitude to a look at the exhibition .
that he had been said : &quot; for me , I was only a show after death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal , Montreal and Paris .
and so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren .
it is tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give you an insight into the work of man who has written a fashion history without ever completing training .
chron@@ ologically the vision is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall work , designed for the much effort : to fr@@ ise the d@@ olls , was committed to an example of a styl@@ ing .
14 tons of material have directed the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich .
before the start of the Oktober@@ fest was still a special purpose : a leather h@@ iss out@@ fit with cork .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are anno@@ yed as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; Gaul@@ tier told .
also Gaul@@ ti@@ ers old Teddy is also shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ re @-@ fashi@@ onable Geh@@ versuche do the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he had dressed up his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , he said Gaul@@ tier .
if his parents have not allowed him to play with a doll .
did he throw away the dis@@ card of fashion then .
he st@@ ole fashion tim@@ ings and looked for the designs of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it , of course .
he can &apos;t pay for his first own fashion show the models .
they got nothing , but could retain the sh@@ all@@ ots .
jew@@ ellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ zer tip as fashion @-@ niche
earlier it went to the long p@@ atter@@ ned machines in and around patches for about 1 metre .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips arose in great amounts of customers , which they worked on bl@@ ank@@ ets and curtains .
but that alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ zz@@ son Pl@@ auen .
instead the mode is important again .
in the initial times of pl@@ au@@ zer tip , mode played a major role , then pushed through the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt lists some examples : top of jewelry , accessories such as bags and other regional trains .
at all , the so @-@ called Vintage mode , which re@@ jects on past sty@@ lists , is an increasing contrac@@ ep@@ tive potential .
and if no niche serves in the textile branch , is no longer available on the market .
they already account for half of all the orders .
Mo@@ unting System Pl@@ auen , together with nine other companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ zer tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales were consumed .
private specialist stores and wholesale are almost no longer available .
our products are hardly to reach the customer on this path .
today the mass goods become much cheaper in the Asian region , and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
in addition , export , current to Russia and in the US .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tried to score points such as C@@ ord@@ ula farmer from Em@@ broi@@ der@@ lin : &quot; since this year we perform a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate student U@@ te Schmidt teaches the sculpture of the western Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized on embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to meet the competition from the Asian region , you need to obtain high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is a voltage range between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a design of existing design will often be varied , in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago noble fashion designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ discovered the historic snow @-@ pointed tip .
the machine sends little places to some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ra Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ sauce served here for inspiration : &quot; previously , I could do nothing with traditional Pl@@ aus@@ ener . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ ji@@ b for their jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate procedure the pattern has shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ l - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
it also supplies the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors were living in the surrounding area and to commemor@@ ate their ancest@@ ry .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ zer .

EU wants to double mercury limit value in rob@@ ber@@ fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large smo@@ kers and for the consumers a significantly higher dose of ner@@ ve gifts .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , the promising working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of lack of industrial and environmental policy are pursued with full impact on pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerv@@ ous factor for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish can be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
big fish @-@ fish are already so strong with mercury , that on the basis of the relevant limit values can not be sold around 50 per cent of the catch .
in duplic@@ ation of the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be dis@@ able .
in return for this cur@@ sing , the EU does not want to shar@@ ply the limit values of 0.1 mg of mercury per kilogram according to F@@ ood@@ watch , watch the limit values in other fish .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , did this as &quot; trick &quot; because of smaller cas@@ fishes , as usually are usually so low so low that they already hold the planned maximum values already today .
hence , the lowering of cl@@ ot@@ ting is therefore &quot; a lack of de@@ fle@@ ction man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metall . it is sufficient for the use in the food chain , especially in smo@@ ked fish .
the Federal Government therefore warned that &quot; low levels of damage to the ner@@ ve system &quot; have already been inflic@@ t .
the Federal Ministry of Environment declared that a &quot; health haz@@ ards &quot; health concern is not expected to be expected on his website with a view to the applicable maximum population .
mercury is mainly found in the environment through coal combustion .
according to a written document by the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal plants contra@@ sted the Green federal government more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of Germany em@@ itted in Germany tot@@ aled .
the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and comprehensive . &quot; in March the mirror was quoted from the paper &quot; Der Spiegel . &quot;
last year , European war@@ nings of mercury in fish already related to the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
