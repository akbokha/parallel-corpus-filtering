the agreement could be closed up to the total amount paid by credit@@ ation land to the mechanism and within a total amount of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future posts of the member states .
but now some conditions are mentioned below , for which the BIS would be prepared to use .
for each Stand@@ by @-@ loan , the BIS must first take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions to be crossed over five years .
with the opening of the l@@ ending as well as for any extension , the BIS would charge a loan commission .

ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells which include the A@@ x ( A@@ y or AO ) an@@ tigen ( which are not ag@@ glut@@ inated in the general by anti @-@ A serum samples of the group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted in standard of anti @-@ A blood groups or an equivalent compar@@ ative equal to A1 and A2 blood cells .
furthermore , it is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted according to the international standard of anti @-@ B blood groups or an equivalent compar@@ ative of B @-@ blood cells .
in no case , the effectiveness of the serum may amount to less than 64 international units per ml .
an un@@ diluted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B group ( group 0 ) blood serum must also produce an easily recognis@@ able ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ y or AO ) .
an anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is bl@@ ended on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent floo@@ ding of the A1 and A2 blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempts will be dissolved with the same amount of an anti @-@ A blood type or with a standard shape of equal activity .

some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ize also homogen@@ ous red blood cells which are em@@ med in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a for the determination of the R@@ h group may be changed when International Standard Edition are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is gained from the blood of one or more individuals that are immun@@ ized by the tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells which contain the an@@ tigen , but not with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ a must have a Tit@@ er of at least 1 : 32 versus C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a standard sal@@ ine level .
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ diluted according to the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) board or an equivalent compar@@ ative act opposite C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells which contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum is possible to react to blood cells , the Do @-@ an@@ tigen levels .
anti @-@ D ser@@ a , which are intended to be used in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed with the same amount of an adult ag@@ glut@@ ination with the same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent of the flood , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completely within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more individuals that are immun@@ ized by the Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells which contain the an@@ tigen levels , but not with human red blood cells that contain the C tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore only specific to the C @-@ an@@ tigen only if the tested blood cells are w@@ asted in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
the Tit@@ er of Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ cd@@ dee blood cells .
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a which are intended to be used in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) , if they are mixed in an object carrier with the same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent of the flood , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ e serum is gained from the blood of one or more individuals that are immun@@ ized by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a Tit@@ er of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a which are intended to be used in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form of anti @-@ D ) , if they are mixed in an object carrier with the same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent of the flood , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera the specif@@ icity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and specif@@ icity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be produced directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both bodies must be effective among the manufacturer specified by the manufacturer .
if serum is intended for use on object dreams according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ence of all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , is not lower than the anti@@ bodies of the anti@@ bodies .
anti @-@ A serum is derived from the blood of animals which can be immun@@ ized by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
