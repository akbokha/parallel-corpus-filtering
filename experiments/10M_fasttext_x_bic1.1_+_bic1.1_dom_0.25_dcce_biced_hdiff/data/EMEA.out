this document is a summary of the European Public Fund ( EP@@ AR ) in which it is explained how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has decided to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug .
if you require further information about your disease or treatment , please read the pack@@ et instructions ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or apply to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melted tablets , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res think and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing things that are not present ) , mist@@ rust and f@@ ren@@ zy ; • bi@@ polar disorder suffer@@ ers , a mental disorder where patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high mood ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ d@@ fy will be used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and pre@@ ventive man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be used or applied to the patient , to which swal@@ lowing of tablets is difficult .
in patients who use simultaneously other medicines , which are the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be adjusted by the Abi@@ d@@ fy dose .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of nerve cells to another .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is thought to be regarded as a &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ter Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ co@@ bal@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in l@@ esser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin plays a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar disorder in order to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and its re@@ occurrence is prevented .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ d@@ advert@@ ised to prevent re@@ occurrence of symptoms has been investigated in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar disorders , which were involved in increased di@@ sem@@ ary , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , Abi@@ ci@@ fy was compared about twelve weeks in 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , which have been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ d@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 Pati@@ ents with Bi@@ polar disorder associated with increased di@@ sem@@ ic@@ ism ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies change the symptoms of patients suffering from a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment .
the company also carried out studies in order to investig@@ ate how the body absor@@ bs melting tablet and absor@@ bs the solution .
in both studies with the injection @-@ solution patients who received Abi@@ ci@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger decrease of symptoms increased to the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy was in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy hin@@ dered up to 74 weeks as a plac@@ ebo . later , man@@ ic episodes have been diagnosed with previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy @-@ injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses had a more effective than plac@@ ebo perceived to relie@@ ve symptoms and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ ci@@ fy to take ( observe with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , ac@@ credit@@ ation ( nau@@ sea ) , ear@@ ache ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , s@@ ali@@ va hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety ( sleep disorders ) , anxiety ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal drug ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder as well as with the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ole , opposed to the risks .
moreover , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solutions in rapid control of increased anxiety or patients with man@@ ic episodes in patients with man@@ bi@@ polar disorder or patients with man@@ bi@@ polar disorder suffer@@ ers , if an oral therapy is not appropriate , over with the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the inc@@ iner@@ ator of Abi@@ d@@ advert@@ ised throughout the European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ ion disorder and prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day for a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day , regardless of meals .
increased efficacy of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of the meals as mono or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ ion disorder patients ≥ 65 years has not been proved .
a lower initial dose of this patient &apos;s group should be considered to be considered a lower initial dose when clinical factors just@@ ify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is set off from combination therapy , the arith@@ me@@ tic dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ ici@@ ary behaviour belongs to psychological disorders and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of anti@@ psych@@ otic treatment , also with treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with Bi@@ polar disorder does not have an increased risk of risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , chronic heart failure , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ depres@@ sive drug ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute de@@ cel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports over during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if patients are diagnosed with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients and symptoms of a late dy@@ dy@@ nia can occur in consideration to reduce or break the dose .
if patient signs and symptoms are developed to indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics have to be depos@@ ed including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with var@@ ic@@ ism or with states that are associated with c@@ amp@@ fan@@ cies in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with arith@@ me@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ ol , increased death risk compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dose and preparing for unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ ol @-@ treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases , extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no exact risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ies @-@ related adverse events of patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or risk factors of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar defic@@ iency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect and could lead to serious complications .
because of the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol should be taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 block@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole , but this effect decreases as clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers an highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should have similar dose @-@ reduc@@ ers .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) metabol@@ ites can result combined with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible met@@ abolic sealing .
if one goes into account the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should not exceed potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eases can have similar effects , and therefore similar can @-@ reducing can be performed .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose height prior to comm@@ end@@ ation .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ( or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be expected with a moderate increase in the arith@@ me@@ tic concentration .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ phy@@ ric / 3 @-@ method@@ ology ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ phy@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy while treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the in@@ adequate data base for humans and safety , this drug may not be applied during pregnancy , unless the potential benefit just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics the patients need to be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence .
the following side effects are more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) more than in plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) :
incidence of the side effects listed below are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks appeared in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol , a total lower incidence of 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ etic and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of EPS 19 % in patients with arith@@ me@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I error - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounts to 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , EPS 26.@@ 6 % was attri@@ but@@ able to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ ad treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term phase of patients over 26 weeks for plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was applied to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol and plac@@ ebo , which resulted in significant clinical analyses of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters resulted in no significant significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic treatment , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ iles Syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , and increased mortality with demen@@ tia cases , symptoms of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
clinical trials and since the market launch were observed in@@ advert@@ ently or deliber@@ ately acute over@@ dos@@ si@@ fication with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg , with no death sequence .
there are no information about the effectiveness of a tick control in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ole . however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of an over@@ dose of use , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma glucose connection .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol is medi@@ ated in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial prot@@ agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine and 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ amine and D3 recept@@ or and to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ gen and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .

in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ole a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 was the proportion of respon@@ dents that followed an account of study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg - Dep@@ res@@ sion @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement over Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the back rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ ad Group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study during sch@@ izophren@@ ia was more than 26 weeks , in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible dose over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior improvement in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder compared to plac@@ ebo no superior efficacy .
in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I error , with or without psychological characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed an adverse effect similar to plac@@ ebo with lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol fair in week 12 .
in Week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also proved a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania on like lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without mental characteristics , which are partially over 2 weeks not on lithium , or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy conducted a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to the chemotherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 . in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol showed themselves in regard to plac@@ ebo with regard to prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in prevention of a recovery in the mania .
based on in vitro studies , the CY@@ P2@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydr@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ ky@@ am@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zes by CY@@ P3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al@@ b@@ ill@@ age is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol at exten@@ sive met@@ abolic rollers through CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism about CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female volunteers , and also showed no gender @-@ dependent effects in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study .
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic has no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in the ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
one single dose study of subjects with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( child @-@ pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) did not show any significant effect regarding the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the class C , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , reproduction tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for can@@ cer@@ ous potential , the shape clinical data had no particular dangers for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceed the maximum dosage or exposure of human beings , they have limited or no meaning for clinical application .
effects include a dose @-@ dependent by side effects ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ments accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell @-@ exposure ) in rats from 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the average maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady State exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose when humans ) .
in addition , a cholesterol drug was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ ction of the hydro@@ xy@@ z metabol@@ ites in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 @-@ 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 @-@ 3 times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .

there are no exact risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ies @-@ related adverse events of patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study with healthy subjects a high @-@ effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ( or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be expected with a moderate increase in the arith@@ me@@ tic concentration .
man@@ ic episodes with bi@@ polar @-@ I error - in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounts to 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol is medi@@ ated in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial prot@@ agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine and 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study during sch@@ izophren@@ ia was more than 26 weeks , in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder compared to plac@@ ebo no superior efficacy .
in a relative bio@@ fe@@ asi@@ bility study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic was compared with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol in tablets in pill form , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a cholesterol drug was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ ction of the hydro@@ xy@@ z metabol@@ ites in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 @-@ 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 @-@ 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
these effects were observed in rab@@ bits that lead to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ ms of the mid @-@ level Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied for rapid control of ag@@ it@@ ational and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be completed with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ ol injection solution and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to minim@@ ize res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended for the adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the drug or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further advanced treatment is indicated by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y &apos;s fusion tray or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution to take off .
there are no investigation on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol injection solutions in patients with ag@@ it@@ ability and behavi@@ oral disorders brought in differently than by sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
in addition to a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines , in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of an extreme se@@ dation , or blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) .
studies on safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole In@@ jection solution are not available for patients with alco@@ hol@@ - or drug tox@@ icity ( prescribed by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , chronic heart failure , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ depres@@ sive drug ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute de@@ cel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports over during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle l@@ eness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ma , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ mia ) .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or risk factors of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar defic@@ iency , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was larger compared to the result of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study that was applied in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ( 15 mg dose ) and given to the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ole , but this effect decreases as clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) metabol@@ ites can be used in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ abolic compounds with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ ected inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore , similar can be performed can be performed .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose height prior to comm@@ end@@ ation .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly were given the intensity of the Sed@@ ation bigger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

107 The following adverse events occur more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of EPS 19 % in patients with arith@@ me@@ tic treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , EPS 26.@@ 6 % was attri@@ but@@ able to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term phase of patients over 26 weeks for plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ ad treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol and plac@@ ebo , which resulted in significant clinical analyses of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters resulted in no significant significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic treatment , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ iles Syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , and increased mortality with demen@@ tia cases , symptoms of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ oral problems resulted in the arith@@ me@@ z@@ ol injection solution with statist@@ ically significant improvements of ag@@ it@@ ational / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole In@@ jection drug was associated with a statist@@ ically significant pe@@ eling with symptoms regarding the ag@@ itation and behavi@@ oral disorders in comparison to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean be@@ ating from the bas@@ eline level at the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end was 5.8 for Plac@@ ebo , 9.6 on Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggres@@ sion , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population , but for statistical significance was determined because of reduced patient population .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 was the proportion of respon@@ dents that followed an account of study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Dep@@ res@@ sion @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement over Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( oral ) , a significantly higher reduction in the back@@ drop was observed in 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study during sch@@ izophren@@ ia was more than 26 weeks , in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5 kg ) .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without mental characteristics which are partially reflected at the therapeutic potential of lithium , compared to the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to the chemotherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks , followed by a 74 @-@ week study of man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol in regard to plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in prevention of a recovery in the mania .
in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection , 90 % increased the AU@@ C after the gift of the same dose as a tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two formulas .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , mean time to achieve the maximum plasma measuring from 1 to 3 hours after use .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole In@@ jection solution has been well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a systematic scheme in systematic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human@@ ist exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on the reproduction consumption for intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns about maternal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) was observed across the maximum human@@ ist exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , reproduction tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for can@@ cer@@ ous potential , the shape clinical data had no particular dangers for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceed the maximum dosage or exposure of human beings ; they have only limited or no meaning for clinical application .
effects include a dose @-@ dependent by side effects ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ments accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell @-@ exposure ) in rats from 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 @-@ fold the middle ste@@ ady state @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose when humans ) .
in addition , a cholesterol drug was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ ction of the hydro@@ xy@@ z metabol@@ ites in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 @-@ 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 @-@ 3 times the recommended daily dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study , in which 460 women participated with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters used to get an anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ some gift ) was compared with the drugs given by a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) .
in total , 66 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane on treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , the conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines .
considered only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , the disease has no difference between medicines and survival compared to the efficiency of disease and survival .
in contrast , patients that previously had other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed , in terms of these indicators , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ contained medicines .
it may also not be applied in patients who have low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ytes in the blood before the treatment starts .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) pointed out that Abra@@ x@@ ane contained in@@ patients with which the first treatment was no longer suggests effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing drugs will not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 the European Commission granted The Abra@@ ham@@ burger Bio@@ Science Limited adopted a permit for the promotion of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is failed and for which a standard Anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line @-@ contained therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ y numbers &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
for sen@@ sor@@ ial Neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 the treatment is to break down to grade 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dos@@ ages in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see paragraph 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dos@@ ages in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of the kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for infin@@ ity and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ related Nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic form@@ ulations by Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics described by pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in patients no longer Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy cycles should be initiated , until the Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ires has increased again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with heavy liver function ( bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clear Abra@@ x@@ ane was not proven in connection with kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac events are not unusual , especially in patients with early Anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
if in the patient after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur , they may be treated with the usual anti @-@ e@@ tics and persistent means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used by pregnant or women in the age @-@ aged age , which do not practise an effective conception of conception , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women in the aged age should use Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable closure method for up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , is recommended , during and up to six months after treatment no child to witness .
male patients should have been advised before treatment via a sper@@ mac@@ ane therapy , as with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of ir@@ reversible infer@@ tility exists .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ red@@ ness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the traffic and ability to serve machinery .
listed below are the most common and important events of adverse events listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were once treated in piv@@ ot@@ al clinical Phase III study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking of important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly re@@ versi@@ bly and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects are listed , which occurred in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as therapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased blood sugar levels in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased blood sugar , reduced phosph@@ orus in the blood , reduced blood sugar .

rest@@ less@@ ness 1 The frequency of over@@ sensitivity response is calculated based on a definite event in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al correlation has been established with these events .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ less active ingredient which supports the re@@ location of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular tubes and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their depression .
these stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic membrane functions .
it is known that Alban@@ i convey@@ s the trans@@ oc@@ yt@@ osis of Plas@@ mac@@ om@@ pon@@ ents into the end@@ o@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the framework of in @-@ vitro studies prove that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by end@@ o@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved trans@@ gen@@ o@@ thel@@ i@@ ale transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 al@@ umin@@ um@@ recept@@ or and due to the al@@ umin@@ in@@ ert Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( spec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two un@@ fold @-@ blind studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of about 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received every 3 weeks for treatment with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation to the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ treatment ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ al@@ ysts .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy first , 27 % only had an ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ al@@ asing and 19 % due to chemotherapy and for ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the response rate and time to progres@@ sion of the disease as well as progres@@ sion @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; first @-@ line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement in a degree of patients who lived at a time during the therapy a periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy Grad 3 .
the natural course of periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy for deriv@@ ation on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 has been determined in clinical trials .
the active response ( AU@@ C ) has increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 And after an intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma increased in multi @-@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume came to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has an extensive ex@@ chan@@ ting distribution and / or soft connection of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid clinical tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gift ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and rif@@ ice stories , Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by using two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was the mean value of the un@@ altered substitute of 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
over 75 years of age , however , only few dates are available since only 3 patients were involved in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and in light of light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic antibody drug , and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
using a ster@@ ile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chloride in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane ste@@ ste@@ el@@ bottle .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ am is similar to an organic medicinal product that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference agents &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood pressure values , which may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if prior to the procedure , a blood @-@ blood @-@ end is not possible and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be directed under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in treating patients with ill@@ nesses , for which the medicine is shown .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a own blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be made by the patient or his car@@ ers if they have received an appropriate guide .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency or in patients who receive chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ders should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per ann@@ on@@ ite in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron ore of all patients can be monitored in order to ensure that no iron defic@@ iency is , and iron comple@@ mentary should be administered during the treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ ine defic@@ iency , or that the body does not adequ@@ ately address the body &apos;s own Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ ine .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in is also applied to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of blood loss .

Ab@@ se@@ amed was induced as an injection in a V@@ ene as part of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients who were suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected at a junction previously or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indic@@ ative for efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ders between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects were investigated by the skin spec@@ kl@@ amed Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who were induced by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries of patients who were amed on Ab@@ se@@ amed were able to maintain the same degree as in those patients who continue to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in contrast to this , the patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , ste@@ aling mig@@ rat@@ ory head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may possibly have hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epoxy or any of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed as determined according to the provisions of the European Union of proof , the medicine has shown a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that puts Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information on the security of the drug in all Member States , including information on the security of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg an approval for the inc@@ iner@@ tia of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .

symptoms and symptoms vary depending on age , gender and overall disease vary ; therefore the assessment of individual clinical course and clinical condition is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ ins by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin associated with or below the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target can be observed .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability a corresponding dose of dos@@ ing should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin is increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ och@@ al al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ och@@ al al@@ fa in the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of an@@ emia and an@@ aesthetic symptoms .
these clinical findings suggest that patients with initial low @-@ value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance boxes than patients in which the initial angi@@ omas is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl ) or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical findings suggest that patients with initial low @-@ value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance boxes than patients in which the initial angi@@ omas is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,8 g / dl ) or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l .

symptoms and symptoms vary depending on age , gender and overall disease last ; therefore the assessment of individual clinical course and clinical condition is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability a corresponding dose of dos@@ ing should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ och@@ al al@@ fa is in the lowest permitted dosage , which is required for the control of an@@ aesthetic symptoms .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ ten@@ al number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the output value , the dose should be between 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin @-@ rise is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ness has risen to &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .

in contrast , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ ten@@ al count increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l versus the output value , a response to the ep@@ och@@ in @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be cancel@@ ed .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the early storage of ≥ 4 blood circulation is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive a dose of 600 i.@@ E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
the iron subst@@ itution should be as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - started to provide great iron reserves before the start of the crash .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 i.@@ E. / kg epoxy , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before operating procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
here , ep@@ och@@ in al@@ fa con@@ form@@ ulates 300 i.@@ e / kg on each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .

200 Your doctor will determine your values of the red blood pigment ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) and adjust your se@@ di@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of a blood circulation ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) possible .
this risk has been carefully derived from treating the treatment with ep@@ och@@ in al@@ fa , in particular if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ eric vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ ous events , e.g. if you have already occurred in thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ( e.g. a deep rever@@ ber@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis or lungs ) .
in case you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed as a growth factor for blood cells act and under certain circumstances can influence the tumor .
if a major orthop@@ e@@ dic surgery is im@@ min@@ ent , the cause of your an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood pigment ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) are too high , you should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed because an increased risk of blood sugar after surgery exists .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( an illness that br@@ ittle the bones ) both in women after men@@ opause , and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high Fra@@ ction chance of ( bone mar@@ qu@@ arri@@ es ) , including those who recently suffered a minor hip action . • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should have at least 500 m@@ g. of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should be given a high dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or injection in a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce symptoms of symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain@@ s , gri@@ pp@@ e@@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s treatment may only be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is as shown in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data collection for zom@@ eta on the assessment of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was used .
in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of sp@@ ine and hips was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 male and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis more than 50 years , which recently suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; it was investigated for the number of fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two trials to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron ( one other bis@@ phosph@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indic@@ ative for efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone tissue ) in the blood again or by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of sp@@ ine fra@@ c@@ rats in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ ans ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the plac@@ ebo patients .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cal ) with those among plac@@ ebo , the risk of hip fra@@ c@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip fra@@ cture 9 % of the patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a question@@ naire ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under a plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days of in@@ fusion and are often less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients that may possibly have hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other component .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates patients are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions on the in@@ fusion station and oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ros@@ is ( dro@@ die of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for doctors , which contains A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as the medicine to use as well as the medicine for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should consult the doctor .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk for fra@@ c@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic war@@ y fra@@ cture .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in case of patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic stem , the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operative application of the hip fra@@ cture ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should be prescribed exclusively by doctors for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment by the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a long re@@ taining period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , equal to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic stem fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced from Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function ( see section 4.4 ) In case of patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended because limited clinical experiences for this patient group are present .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients is similar to younger .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data are missing to in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because of these patients population only limited clinical experiences .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia should be treated before the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the quick introduction of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone structure , a temporary , occasionally symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium , at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) for at least 10 days .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered to be a dental examination with reasonable dental treatment before use of bis@@ phosph@@ ate .
for patients who need dental attacks , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opathy in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that may occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced from Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious adverse events reported in cases of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ val Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the total approval of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable substances effects are listed in table 1 .
cardi@@ ovascular dysfunction is associated with kidney problems resulting in a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum credits ) and in rare cases of acute kidney failure .
the alter@@ ation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing ( annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure , as well as limited kidney function in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis more than three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in serum credits within 10 days after injection was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the assessment of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values found below the normal swing range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
all patients received a supple@@ mentary amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures following a hip fra@@ cture and in the mor@@ bid @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a recently suffered enti@@ ation , the majority of patients were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion station , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen in the area of j@@ as@@ ionally , especially for cancer patients who were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ate ( primarily in jaw areas ) , treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ric acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients , tooth extraction or other dental attacks .

clinical effectiveness in treating the post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once per year for 3 consecutive years was shown for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone @-@ ch@@ te@@ br@@ isk ( BM@@ D ) and at least two slight or a middle heavy sp@@ inal body fra@@ cture , with or without signs of an existing ver@@ te@@ br@@ al gland .
effects on morph@@ ometric ass@@ ump@@ tions A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a has fallen significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new sp@@ inal specimens ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and over were reduced by 60 % reduced risk of sp@@ inal cells compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reported a lasting effect on three years , which resulted in a reduced low 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for boun@@ ti@@ fications .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a raised the bone density on the lum@@ bar , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly to all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar sp@@ ine by 6.7 % , the entire hip at 6,0 % , the basket of shame rose by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the basin @-@ ridge .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ P ) analysis showed an increase in @-@ treated bone volume with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated to plac@@ ebo as a result of the sub@@ trac@@ table bone volume and the preservation of sub@@ trac@@ tional bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in perio@@ dic intervals during the duration of the study .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the output value and was held at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was reduced significantly by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the overall mort@@ al was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D at the total spec@@ s and but@@ to@@ es at all points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led over 24 months versus plac@@ ebo treatment to an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the total price and 4,3 % on the lap side .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized to 508 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to suggest a reduction in clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8,7 % in the plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , it was once again an annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in comparison to the percentage change of lum@@ bar ver@@ te@@ bra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the output value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was investigated in patients and patients at the age above 30 years with radi@@ ologically proven Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ multiple to 3,@@ 0@@ fold of age @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c in comparison to the dose of 30 mg once a day during 2 months was detected in two six @-@ month compar@@ ative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain relief was observed after 6 months as compared to the output value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as a Respon@@ si@@ fication at the end of the six @-@ month trial period ( to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron in treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , compared with 71 of patients with Ris@@ ed@@ ron in treated patients who are maintained in a medium duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 @-@ 15 minutes in@@ fu@@ si@@ ent in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ mac@@ euticals data to be dos@@ ed independently .
afterwards , the plasma level rose rapidly from &lt; 10 % to the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , not more than 0.1 % of the highest value .

the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the af@@ ore@@ mentioned t ½ -@@ values ) , however , represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion about the kidneys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose may be bound in the urine while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body clearing is ir@@ respective of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in a decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron concentration of 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration of time ) .
a reduced clearing of due to cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 en@@ cep@@ hal@@ ic acid substances is unlikely to be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed - because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed - because it is a weak or not a direct and / or ir@@ reversible , fuel @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the 450@@ -

this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing up to 35 ml / min with no dose adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ric acid .
because of severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are possible , no statements are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest in@@ consp@@ icious intraven@@ ous dose consisted in mice 10 mg / kg body weight and up to 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) are administered times ( based on AU@@ C ) for a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day @-@ intervals , in total 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , referring to AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Fund ( EP@@ AR ) in which it is explained how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has decided to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( especially overweight patients ) is not shown . • It can be used together with another di@@ abe@@ tic medication ( therapy medicine ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , patients with met@@ form@@ in alone can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose alone .
in combination with a sul@@ fa resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fa drugs or insulin can be maintained , except in patients with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reducing the dose of the sul@@ fa drugs or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be utilized and the blood sugar level drops , which makes type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos has been examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fa resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , concentration in the blood was measured in the blood ( gly@@ ca@@ ine hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos lead to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which indicates that the blood sugar levels have been reduced by 15 mg , 30@@ mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study the effect of an additional gift from Ac@@ tos remained an existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fa resin in a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study involving the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 289 patients the patients who also had Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.14 % in patients who took plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual disorders , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be applied in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ( high concentration of acid - in blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 the European Commission granted the &quot; Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited adopted a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the signature &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in cases met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ toler@@ ability ( see section 4.4 ) .
for patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor ( e.g. : early heart attacks or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or oil , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ogenic reserves .
in signs and symptoms of heart failure , patients should be observed if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardi@@ ovascular disease with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was performed in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease .
in this study , an increase in reports on cardi@@ ac suff@@ iciency appears , which resulted in an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased input liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit for normal range ) or with other signs of liver illness , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased till 3 times the maximum limit of the norm range , the liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control .
if patient symptoms are developed to point out to a he@@ p@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ solved nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , abdominal breathing , fatigue , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver enzymes .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is continued until the procedure of the laboratory can be guided by the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , that can be stir@@ red from fat deposits and in some cases connected with a fluid re@@ tention .
as a consequence of a hem@@ odi@@ lution with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a minor reduction in the medium hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed for compar@@ ative controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ og@@ r@@ its by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lower extent also in patients with sul@@ fa drugs and insulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ og@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin @-@ sensitive patients in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fa resin , or as a branch combination with insulin , the risk of a dos@@ ed addic@@ tive hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , was reported on a occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ular de@@ ac@@ ons with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear if there is a direct link between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ma , but the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms should be aware of the potential of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary of messages undes@@ irable adverse events regarding bone frag@@ mentation , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on
the calculated Fra@@ ktur was composed of 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ TI@@ VE study , a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardi@@ ovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patients ) were treated in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
the patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to use a pregnancy or intake this entrance ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on investig@@ ating the inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines that become met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ inhibit@@ or are not to be expected .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zil ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around 3 times .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin @-@ resistant insulin is dimin@@ ished , thereby reducing the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the pre@@ oc@@ tal growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; commonly &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare cases : unknown ( not predic@@ table from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the index of the lens , as they can also be observed with other hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ asc@@ ge came out over thre@@ e@@ fold the threshold range beyond the standard , but less often than in a plac@@ ebo or sul@@ fa drugs .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with prec@@ urs@@ ors of advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was the frequency of a serious heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on resp@@ .
since the market launch was seldom been reported in the heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure .
a comprehensive analysis of messages derived from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.@@ 100 patients in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in compar@@ ative medication @-@ treated groups .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ TI@@ VE study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , fra@@ c@@ tures occurred in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
if taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not cause symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) , which results in the animal model to an increased insulin @-@ sensitive skin of liver , grease and skel@@ eton muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glucose in the case of insulin @-@ resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as a physi@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investig@@ ate the time of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was uph@@ eld by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were in@@ adequate despite the 3 @-@ month optim@@ isation phase with insulin , random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continued to take insulin ; a reduction in the insulin treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over one year , below Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a statist@@ ically significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ a was observed in comparison to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , an 18 @-@ week study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , a reduction in the plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol level as well as slightly , however clin@@ ically significant increased LD@@ L cholesterol levels was observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo , no statist@@ ically significant increase of LD@@ L cholesterol was observed , while under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d lower values were observed .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial raised tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this is both an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the p@@ ace@@ tic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .

after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of the un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on normally within 2 hours of application .
on this basis , the contribution from M @-@ IV used to efficacy in approximately the triple of the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

following oral application of radioactive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in the thread ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elim@@ ination time of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the entire active metabolism is 16 @-@ 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearing are similar .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been involved in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin and type 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to use insulin .
the study found the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ ca@@ ine hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c refle@@ ctions that indicates that the blood sugar levels were greatly reduced as strongly as with another humanity .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients that may possibly have hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human digest@@ ion ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may need to be adapted if combined with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is valid for the package age ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were over@@ thrown during the treatment of diabetes .
October 2002 the European Commission granted the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company approval for the acquisition of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the whole European Union .
mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a quick initial effect is pressed together with a longer lasting effect .
the injection pin has to be placed under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .

any amend@@ ment to the strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting insulin , long @-@ acting insulin , human body or insulin delivery ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin in animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage .
if changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane can be necessary in the patient with a dose adjustment , it may be necessary during the first time or within the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients receiving hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia reactions after a change from animal on human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced than with their previous insulin .
prior to travelling , which should go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to get the advice of his doctor , as such travels may be applied or taken to other times .

this document is a summary of the European Public Fund ( EP@@ AR ) in which it is explained how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has decided to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug .
the dental , effective component in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin @-@ human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced with the procedure of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology : &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu * EMEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document is Author@@ ised for non @-@ business only the the EMEA . how was Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id examined ?
Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be applied in patients that may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may need to be adjusted , when combined with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood sugar .
October 2002 the European Commission granted the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company approval for the acquisition of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin be mixed , the amount of insulin has to be drawn , then the amount of the long acting insulin .
3 If the transition to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id is necessary in the patient a dose adjustment is required , it may be necessary during the first time or within the first weeks or months after the conversion .
prior to travelling , which should go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to get the advice of his doctor , as such travels may be applied or taken to other times .
5 General diseases and complaints by the appointment of Gel@@ sen@@ sel@@ dorf - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction during insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ om at the injection point ) .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , cand@@ y , or sugar fruit juice with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose through the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for treating hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 in di@@ abe@@ tic patients and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ abe@@ tic patients who reduced hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4.4 to 6,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , reduced by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two piv@@ ot@@ al studies in phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ tension and g@@ out .
the primary efficiency end@@ point was in any study of the proportion of patients with which the last three monthly certain Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ac@@ id@@ spar was &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum or@@ bit@@ rate of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
in regard to the reduction of serum samples of serum levels below 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and Figure 1 ) , the statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine is 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
with regard to the permanent reduction of the serum samples of serum ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) , the F@@ ACT study showed statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ ine 300 mg daily .

in the doctor &apos;s visit , the reduction of the serum @-@ acid temperature at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) was observed and permanently retained the entire treatment .
509 patients received per@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum credits &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction . the AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney failure ( i.e. ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficiency end@@ point is 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients achieved .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of kidney disease in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with heavy kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum samples of ≥ 10 mg / dl about 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected from the open extension study in Phase 3 showed that in the months 16 @-@ 24 , the permanent reduction of the serum samples ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) revealed a decrease in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a stro@@ be ) .
this is associated with a reduction of the seals size , which in 54 % of patients under@@ took a complete dis@@ appearance of the se@@ al@@ k@@ no@@ des until month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ E values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received alkal@@ ine @-@ renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) and the area under the plasma key time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at was increased from 10 mg to 120 m@@ g. of dos@@ ages .
in doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , the AU@@ C was observed for the level of AU@@ C , which is bigger than the dos@@ ed proportional rise .
after taking single or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max amounts to approx . 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,3 µ@@ g / ml .
however no clin@@ ically significant change has been observed in the percentage decrease of the serum concentration of serum ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state capacity ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range between 29 @-@ 75 l and doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma integration of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary ties to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is achieved via the concentration of concentration of 80 to 120 m@@ g. a constant .
in vitro studies with human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that has produced Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ ered Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was reported as un@@ modified Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic rate and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and another unknown met@@ abolic ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion about the urine , about 45 % of the dose in the chair were found as un@@ modified Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic rate and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and another unknown met@@ abolic ( 7 % ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are frag@@ ile ) in women after men@@ opause , with which there is risk for low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking , or intake of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amin@@ supplements ) .
in order to avoid mat@@ uring of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not take up until after the first food intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 should be used separately from other medicines which are approved in the European Union , the company registered data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to stim@@ ulate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those with those who exclusively had al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate income ( 32 % ) .
the company also appe@@ aled data that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE does not correspond to the dose that is needed for preventing bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones , joints ) and symptoms of digest@@ ive system such as stomach pain , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cers ) , bladder problems ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , abnormal abdom@@ en ( ro@@ aring stomach ) , as well as Sau@@ res .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or any other ingredients , the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be applied .
it must not be used in diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ calc@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who stand and sit upright at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amin@@ ants ) for the day .
the following critics are to be followed precisely to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swallowed up on the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not cut the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ zer@@ a exists . • Pati@@ ents should not take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sion , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the dose of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially these were severe and required a hospital reference instructions ) .
the doctor therefore puts attention to all signs and symptoms outlined on possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out when treating symptoms of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al pain , or retro@@ st@@ ern@@ al pain or rest@@ oring the medicine and to get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects seems to be increased in patients who did not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms outlined on a mal@@ ign@@ ite irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing directions will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .

the clinical assessment of the treated doctor is crucial for therapeutic planning in every patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients will be dependent on taking the dose of the dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE capsule in the next morning after they have noticed their s@@ wis@@ s .
they should not take two tablets the same day , but taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week .
other diseases aff@@ ecting the minerals ( such as vitamin D defic@@ iency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm@@ us ) should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supple@@ mentary food , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate if they are taken at the same time .
as a result , patients need to wait at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before taking other drugs ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific intervention trials were not carried out , al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or l@@ act@@ ating women .
animal studies with an end@@ ron@@ ate leave no notice due to dam@@ aging effects regarding the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered to adult patients to have a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent a elim@@ ination of transplan@@ t organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously executed studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with ren@@ al transplan@@ t , whereby the application of Ad@@ vag@@ raf have been compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indic@@ ative of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was cancelled after a period of a year ( for example it was investigated as often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a res@@ um@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis ) was necessary .
in addition , more recent studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients were performed with liver transplan@@ tation and studied with liver transplan@@ tation and studied as Ad@@ vag@@ raf have been recorded in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro , antibiot@@ ics ( such as Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or one of the other ingredients may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be c@@ auti@@ ous when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ raf , as the adult dose or dose may be adapted accordingly .

only doctors , who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ supp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tation const@@ ants , should make this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ supp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to transplan@@ tation or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ types or over@@ rainf@@ all .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; change@@ over@@ s of formulation or regim@@ es should only be performed under the eng@@ aging control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a consequence of an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dos@@ ing adap@@ tions must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ tile remains preserved .
the dose of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ulsion and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations
after change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Valley nose should be controlled prior to the switch and over two weeks after the conversion .
on Day 4 the system@@ ic exposure was measured with both cases of liver and liver transplan@@ t patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley are recommended during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure proper substance @-@ exposure in immediate reproduction phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the adult dose can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
in case the condition of the patient is allowed in the first postoperative period no oral in@@ gest@@ ion of medicines may be introduced to the tac@@ tic acid treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application to supp@@ ression of the transplan@@ t discharge needs to be maintained ; therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
recommended dos@@ ing - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft treatment . oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy ought to start with 0,@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
other dose adjustments may be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the process of stabil@@ isation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
recommended dos@@ ing - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation . the oral ad@@ sor@@ raf therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dose of dos@@ ing - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf have to be converted to a daily dose of twice daily dose of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf . this change@@ over is to take place twice daily with a dose of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the entire daily dose .
after a change@@ over from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ s@@ ants on ad@@ mit@@ raf once daily the treatment with the recommended oral and liver transplan@@ tation should start daily for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
heart transplan@@ tation in adult patients who have been converted to Ad@@ mal@@ aria is an oral initi@@ ation of 0,15 mg / kg / day a day to take .
other Transp@@ lan@@ ces , although there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in pneum@@ - , pan@@ kre@@ in and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ t patients in an oral initi@@ ation of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in rec@@ tal transplan@@ t patients in an oral initi@@ ation of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initi@@ ation of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the target range can be required in case of patients with severe liver function .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Since the kidney function ex@@ erts no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ atine ) is recommended to calculation of the cre@@ atine capsule and monitoring the ureth@@ ra .

recommendations to the valley level in full blood the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ulsion and toler@@ ability in individual cases under thorough sampling of whole blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ testosterone levels .
it is recommended to run common controls of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Valley during the first two weeks after implant@@ ation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .

as Ad@@ vag@@ raf introduced a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ t@@ ations of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials make it possible that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the v@@ antage levels in the blood exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the lower blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are usually in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation usually in the range from 5 to 20 n@@ g / ml , and heart transplan@@ t patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent therapy of liver , kidney , cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts usually blood concentrations were used in the range from 5 to 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has lead to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ tation or other side effects resulting from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub @-@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; change@@ over@@ s of formulation or regim@@ es should only be performed under the eng@@ aging control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 In the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation treatment , which have been proven against other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ ants or therapies , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ation formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf have not been found for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation in adult heart transplan@@ tation and transplan@@ tation in children &apos;s age .
because of possible effects , which may lead to a reduction in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or other plant healing agents ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant healing agents during a treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf . ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of tac@@ tile concentrations in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases ag@@ gra@@ f can be seen as a car@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy called a@@ que@@ ous hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ie , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing cardi@@ ac disease , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid effects and oils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protection factor .
if patients who have tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for pre@@ aches such as head@@ ache , altered consciousness levels , cr@@ amps and vision should show , should be a radi@@ ographic examination ( e.@@ g .

simultaneous use of pharmac@@ euticals or herbal remedi@@ es that are known as Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 may significantly increase or lower the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is advis@@ able to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels with the same gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus depend@@ ant for maintaining consistent concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a highly distinct interaction was achieved with An@@ tim@@ y@@ ot@@ ics such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the rise of blood @-@ level increased mainly from the increased cell bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on as it is used in acute dis@@ gust@@ ing reactions , may increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ al@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; hence , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P3@@ A4 that may imp@@ air metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can lower the clearing of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thereby increase the hormone exposure , is very careful with regard to sensitive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce potentially the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phenol and their half @-@ way time .
the results of a small number of exam@@ inations on transplan@@ tation errors do not provide an increased risk in regard to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ ants , compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ ants , which consists of adverse events regarding the course and the result of pregnancy .

adv@@ ocate is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood pressure disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application focus on whether an Adv@@ ocate for the treatment of bleeding occurs in surgical intervention .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in the joints , muscles , or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa cannot be extracted from human plasma , but named after a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which they are capable of forming the human blood pressure VIII .
adv@@ ate is a medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is produced differently , so the medicine does not contain protein human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of severe and moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding as well as surgical procedures .
in the main study the efficacy of adv@@ o@@ cates for the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new levels of blood level with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; well &quot; assessed .
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ance ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII .
adv@@ ances may not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human ear factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the B@@ ax@@ ter AG company for the In@@ tranet of Adv@@ ancement in the whole European Union .
dosage A dosage and duration of the subst@@ itution therapy is determined according to the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ Man@@ gels , according to the degree of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the case of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not drop under the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) can repeat for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute attacks are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger is over .
during treatment course , a corresponding dose of the injec@@ tions of the administered dose and the frequency of injec@@ tions is an adequate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma cutting .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and exhibit different half@@ way times .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ activity cannot be reached , or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to suggest an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the administration of the administration should be directed at the end of the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in treating patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII and Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ rel@@ ates with the degree of exposure to the factor VIII , which depends on the risk within the first 20 movement stage of the largest and other factors .
in previously treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 prec@@ urs@@ or and an@@ am@@ ne@@ table @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product , the inhibit@@ ors of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
because of the rare occ@@ l@@ wing of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women lie on the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have all previously untreated patients having a higher risk to create inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each of 3 patients ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not predic@@ table ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) The unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ an factor VIII . ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ots were maintained during all the time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - Mir@@ ror in the Plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed adequate values on the 15th post@@ oper@@ atively .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 , with diagnosis of moderate to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ AD ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to a factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
moreover , in none of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed of moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) , after previous exposure to a factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) , an F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was noticed .
previously , patients with an ongoing clinical study showed 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) of an A@@ DV@@ ATE @-@ treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients to traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of the antibody tit@@ ers against those proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statist@@ ically significant up@@ trend and an ongoing peak of the anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , otherwise there are no signs or symptoms shown to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were reported on the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , ras@@ hes , and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several repeated items in the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has been reported to allergic reactions of the allergic type , an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic or an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reactions ( frequency is not known ) .
the activated factor VIII works as a c@@ of@@ ac@@ tor for the active factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X of factor X .
all pharmac@@ ist studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( base value of the factor VIII @-@ Activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients , or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) , officially announced that the company re@@ trac@@ ted its application for the use of an Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue , which connects other structures in the body , is affected and supported ) .
it is a type of virus which is gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; that has changed so that there is no copies of yourself and therefore no infections can trigger when humans can trigger .
adv@@ o@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus facilitate the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein that is formed from the un@@ defective human body of the p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to damage damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA can not be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient prior to Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer in the area of sub @-@ construction , which occurred in bone and brain .
after the CH@@ MP concerns the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , there were still a few questions un@@ solved .
based on the documents , initially submitted documents , CH@@ MP has submitted a list of questions that will be sent to the company by day 120 .
the CH@@ MP opinion has not been sufficient to bring Adv@@ ex@@ in Adv@@ ex@@ in to Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ours benefits for patients .
the Committee had further concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company had not sufficiently documented that an ec@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment , nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company didn &apos;t inform the CH@@ MP of it whether the withdrawal symptoms of patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs .
&quot; modified drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composed of that one of the effective components should be em@@ itted immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
Aer@@ un@@ aze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever ) , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ( nas@@ al det@@ ours ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ tiv@@ al swelling ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
for adults and teenagers over 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ op@@ lan is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as soon as possible and terminated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( clo@@ gged nose ) , cl@@ ut@@ ured .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be put on the block@@ age of the nose .
the main features were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the fever bli@@ p symptoms , which were reported by patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed according to a standard scale , how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hypo@@ cr@@ us@@ u@@ pf@@ ene symptoms apart from the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose , the patients who had flown with Aer@@ op@@ ade decreased by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine alone .
when only the weak@@ ening of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients suffer from Aer@@ op@@ aze a reli@@ ev@@ ing of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who are Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ un@@ aze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ iness ( inflammation ) , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( calling it@@ less@@ ness ) , in@@ const@@ ip@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep sin@@ cer@@ ity ) , som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ nia .
Aer@@ op@@ ol may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or any of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ al agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another drug for treating aller@@ gies ) .
Aer@@ un@@ aze can also not be applied in patients who have caused hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , ure@@ ter@@ ies ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ otic stroke ( hyper@@ thy@@ mus ) , or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( causing a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on July 30 , 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe to a permit for the transport of passengers on the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however it is to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ush or che@@ w ) .
Aer@@ un@@ aze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data for irrit@@ ability and efficacy .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ he@@ dr@@ ine can take off with time .
after the reduction in the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ atory , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as a physi@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( Mao ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after termination of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity of combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ des such as bro@@ o@@ cri@@ p@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , the per@@ oral or nas@@ al as ab@@ duc@@ ed rhin@@ o@@ emul@@ sion ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ az@@ oline , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ y@@ olin , n@@ ig@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s cent@@ rifu@@ gal and does not suff@@ ice to address corresponding recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ un@@ aze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data do not suff@@ ice to address corresponding recommendations for dosage .
patients need to be informed that treatment with the occurrence of hyper@@ tension or an Tach@@ yon or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) has to be cancelled .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients with heart rhythm • patients with heart rhythm disorders • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the history of diabetes , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ chos@@ pas@@ m in the history of history .
Aer@@ un@@ aze has dis@@ soci@@ ate at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ amine has otherwise shown positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or reduce sever@@ ity .
in addition to clinical ex@@ ams with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given additionally , however no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed .
with the results of the psych@@ otrop@@ ical tests no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and those treated with plac@@ ebo were regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in had taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme has not yet been identified , so that interaction with other medicines may not be excluded entirely .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 drugs are not in@@ hib@@ its neither a sub@@ strate or an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
the in@@ security of the use of aer@@ ob@@ tains during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregnancy , however no raising the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals not always transferred to humans and on the basis of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctor properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , aer@@ ob@@ bles should not be used in pregnancy .
patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it may lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic or ability to serve machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardi@@ ovascular disease ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ or , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .

these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 out of human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ i as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molec@@ ule P @-@ Selec@@ tive on end@@ o@@ thel@@ ial cells .
for a single dose @-@ study with an adult , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no effect on standard measurement sizes of the fluid , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective hits or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily did not improve the frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the recommended dosage may cause more sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , an speed@@ ometer or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal unusual rhin@@ itis , where 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ op@@ ard tablets .
in both studies hist@@ amin@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ op@@ ard tablets , determines the overall co@@ res for symptoms ( except of nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ tiv@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a therapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ un@@ aze tablets in regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ g@@ inal swelling , was significantly higher than an chemotherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ un@@ aze pills showed no significant differences in regard to gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose @-@ study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ ob@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is det@@ ectable in the plasma within 30 minutes after administration .
following the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ op@@ aze at healthy volunteers for 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was reached on Day 10 .
in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dos@@ cope study , which was carried out with formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , four subjects died Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in badly dependent metabolism .
a components of interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was bio@@ equivalent according to the gift of a aer@@ in@@ ct tablet in the general form of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , the tox@@ icity at repeated gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine have no particular dangers to recognize humans .
the combination possessed no larger tox@@ icity as their individual components , and the observed effects were generally in connection with the ingredient p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine .
in re@@ production of ox@@ ic studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was not iter@@ ated at an dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 m@@ L sy@@ rup or resp@@ .
for children ages six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( among them four trials of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two trials in patients who also had asthma ) .
the efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of squares , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and efficiency on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment was determined .
further studies were presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and melting the fusion in the same way as the tablets and the application of children is harmless .
in an allergic rhin@@ itis , if the results of all studies were examined , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symp@@ tom ( symp@@ tom percentage points ) by 25 to 26 % in the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of the symp@@ tom after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to patients treated with plac@@ ebo were treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , lau@@ rel or any of the other components .
January 2001 the European Commission granted the SP Europe to grant access to the European Community by A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union .
one tablet a day , with or without a meal , to relie@@ ve symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical studies on efficacy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in with juven@@ iles from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should occur in accordance with the previous illness @-@ lauf@@ er and may end up after the end of the symptoms and can re@@ occur again .
in the persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) patients may be recommended during the everyday life a constant treatment .
clinical trials were not identified as part of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the dose of alcohol and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied by alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it may lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic or ability to serve machinery .
in clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , with the recommended dose of 5 mg daily , 3 % more side effects in patients with a@@ eri@@ us were reported as in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events that were reported more often than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth flu@@ idity ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years the most common low @-@ effect head@@ ache has been treated with 5,@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ phase study , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 out of human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ i as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molec@@ ule P @-@ selection on end@@ o@@ thel@@ ial cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days a day was not statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovascular effect .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval was shown .
for a single dos@@ sier trial with an adult , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no effect on standard measurement sizes of the fluid , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective hits or tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ ev@@ ing symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ ching , tr@@ ump inf@@ ant and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be placed in dependence on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown in the overall co@@ res of the question@@ naire on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was representative of other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ physi@@ ology is very similar to the e@@ ti@@ ology in different shapes and chronic patients can be easier pro@@ spective .
since the hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in leads to an improvement in the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria in addition to improving the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving man@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first tin @-@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , were excluded from the study .
an improvement in the rate of cancer by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients , compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal rhin@@ itis . population was higher in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a day of daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was not identified yet , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines aren &apos;t excluded entirely
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hib@@ its not CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 drug is not in@@ hib@@ its neither a sub@@ strate or an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
in a single @-@ dos@@ ed study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low cal@@ orie ) do not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
the clinical trials performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in performed with a compar@@ ative degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences in relation to the tox@@ icity profiles of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in can no particular dangers for human beings .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relie@@ ve symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the remaining doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data are occurring , which support treatment of a inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous rhin@@ itis with a@@ eri@@ us treatment .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ ations or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of the history of care should play a role in diagnosis , physical testing and appropriate laboratory and skin exam@@ inations .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and experience a higher sub@@ strate ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ is for children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed - is identical to children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed up normally .
this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with severe problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose in@@ tolerance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ se skin in@@ suff@@ iciency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , equality of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not reinforced under the influence of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total sti@@ ff@@ ness of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar in the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup @-@ Group , similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with a@@ eri@@ us , when treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ phase study of adults and adolescents , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 were given as a result of an anti@@ hist@@ amine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years old ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children can be similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in can be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults on children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically significant @-@ cardi@@ ovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was used over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents had no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
for an single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were in clinical trials to no imp@@ air@@ ment of the Psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological studies in adults it did not affect the simultaneous production of alcohol @-@ induced performance imp@@ air@@ ment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and you@@ thful patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , ac@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ ev@@ ing symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ ching , tr@@ it@@ ching and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as shown in the overall co@@ res of the question@@ naire on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ st@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving man@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first tin @-@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
the spread of this fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed phen@@ otyp@@ s was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ cas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the regulatory H@@ 5@@ N1 sub@@ mer@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu , which is caused by the flu ( Type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 flu @-@ virus infection .
this is a special type of vaccine which could cause a trunk of influ@@ enza , which could cause future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of influ@@ enza virus appears that can easily spread human beings because humans have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system contained in the vaccine contained parts of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus as &quot; bodies alien &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies to it .
this makes the immune system later in a position to make contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus of this Stam@@ l faster antibody .
afterwards , the aph@@ rag@@ m of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as a body ) , was cleaned , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this gave the scope of the clinical data base to assess the safety of vacc@@ ination , to meet the requirements of the EMEA region guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you participate in clinical testing and require further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor .

it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years using the Human Immun@@ ode@@ fic@@ iency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are caused by the acquired immun@@ ode@@ fic@@ iency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low their capsules directly , A@@ generic ase is available as a solution for use , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ generic ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has tested the an@@ tivir@@ al drug of the patient before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ generic ase is based on body weight .
aging in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs decreases the HIV @-@ amount in the blood and holds it at a low level .
AIDS is not to heal , however , the damage of the immune system and thus can result in the development of infections related infections and diseases .
A@@ generic ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al agents , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who previously had not been treated with ease inhibit@@ ors .
the medicines that were low with do@@ dised Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced Medic@@ ines were compared with 206 adults who used earlier prot@@ eases , compared with other prot@@ eases .
main indic@@ ative for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven concentration of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the variation of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies of patients who had previously had no prot@@ eases had taken , after 48 weeks under A@@ generic power , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml as under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ generic ase was less effective than ind@@ din@@ vi@@ r .
in children , A@@ generic ase also reduced the viral load , but of the children who used to deal with prot@@ eases earlier , were only very few on treatment .
in the study involving adults who were previously treated with prot@@ eases , this drug was treated with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ampli@@ fied drugs to increase the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came to a stronger decrease in viral load after four weeks than with the patients who far@@ med their previous prot@@ eases :
the most common adverse events of A@@ generic ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , wind ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , ras@@ hes and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ generic contamination may not be applied in patients , possibly allergic to am@@ ni@@ b@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ generic may also not be used in patients receiving cur@@ rants ( an herbal supplement for treating depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are the same as aging gases and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood to health .
as with other drugs against HIV , in patients suffering A@@ generic ase , the risk of a li@@ fel@@ yst@@ ro@@ ph@@ ie ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ton@@ ic ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by a soothing immune system ) .
finally , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ generic application in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs are used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ generic is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefits of A@@ generic in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had no prot@@ eases could have taken .
A@@ generic ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; as the date of approval of scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited , a permit for the transport of people across the European Union .
A@@ generic ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral pharmac@@ euticals for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ eases inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children 4 years of age .
it is usually intended to be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ o booster of Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than from am@@ ni@@ b@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic intake capsules and solution are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ ni@@ b@@ r twice daily combined with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ generic capsules can be applied without the increased addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses should be applied to am@@ big@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ ni@@ b@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ ni@@ b@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ generic ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eases could not be investigated in children .
A@@ generic is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the lack of data for infin@@ ity and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with severe liver function problems at 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function problems , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ generic ase can not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to risk of reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ it@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ ni@@ b@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not result in HIV infection , and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ generic asis prevents the risk of transm@@ itting HIV to other sexual contact or contamination with blood .
it is usually intended to be used with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are treated in chronic hepat@@ itis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have increased risk of severe liver disease with potentially fatal journeys .
for the case of simultaneous treatment of hepat@@ itis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with existing reduced liver function including chronic hepat@@ itis or chronic hepat@@ itis show increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous application of A@@ generic ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ular or other glu@@ co@@ Doctor are not recommended to use it because the possible use of a treatment the risk of system@@ ic corne@@ al ero@@ id effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the ad@@ ren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the extraction of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin be strongly reli@@ eved of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , including hyst@@ er@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin for increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is not recommended .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , are used methods to determine the drug concentration .
in patients that use these drugs simultaneously , A@@ generic can be less effective for reduced plasma sensors ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abo@@ dic inter@@ actions with Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to alter the type of interaction .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at Op@@ iat@@ ric symptoms , especially if additionally , low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given next .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity according to the high prop@@ yl alcohol content of the A@@ generic remedy , this formulation of treatment is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with care in certain other patient groups .
A@@ generic ase should be ab@@ sent to duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received anti @-@ viral therapy including prot@@ eases , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic or an ex@@ az@@ her@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus have been reported .
many of the patients had diseases to their therapy drugs were required which are associated with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .

in h@@ olog@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ eases reports , reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous k@@ ut@@ ans hem@@ atology and hem@@ or@@ list@@ sen .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ allergic reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ den@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial e@@ ti@@ ology is adopted ( including use of cor@@ on@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ros@@ is were reported in particular for patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width ath@@ ase can not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low @-@ therapeutic width A@@ generic ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with drugs , which are mainly mixed with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to higher plasma screens with severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it has been shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rology failure and resistance development .
in an attempt to compens@@ ate the decreased plasma sensor by a dose of other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were often observed undes@@ irable effects on the liver .
St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum level of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r can be decreased by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with cur@@ rant herbs ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taking St. John &apos;s wort , the Am@@ gen@@ av@@ irus mirror and , if possible to susp@@ end the viral load and se@@ duce St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for any of the medicine is not necessary when clo@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ ni@@ b@@ r ( see also ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased by 30 % for C@@ max , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r were taken twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day that demonstrate their effectiveness and imm@@ ac@@ eke@@ eping of this treatment schem@@ ati@@ as .
52 % moder@@ ated if am@@ ni@@ b@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was given .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in the plasma at the combination of am@@ ni@@ b@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg kel@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ ni@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) can be administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended to establish a clear monitoring as the effectiveness and irrit@@ ability of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic study on use of A@@ generic ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is advised due to the ant@@ acid component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , that the income of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ generic ase are at least an hour apart . ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , with the gift of ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment required .
the treatment with av@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ orph@@ ic and sa@@ quin@@ abo@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be de@@ br@@ ated .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine to other prot@@ eases or existing limited data can be dis@@ cour@@ aged that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may be sun@@ k to the serum concentration of am@@ it@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of a reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma cutting .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rology monitor should be carried out as an accurate pre@@ diction of the combination of am@@ it@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r and R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in resulted in an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in by 193 % , resulting in an increase in non @-@ toxic effects .
if it is required for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in should be administered in together with A@@ generic medicines to reduce the dose of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmaceutical @-@ studies with A@@ generic medicines in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin have not been performed , but the plasma level of both pharmac@@ euticals could be increased in the event of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ hi@@ vi@@ r and 100 mg kel@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in increasing the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day in comparison to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day without simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ab@@ ra@@ vi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can be applied together with aspects , may cause interaction .
patients should therefore be monitored using toxic reactions which are monitored using these drugs if they are used in combination with aspects .
based on the data of other prot@@ eases , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as A@@ generic ase , as it may come to res@@ ume disorders .
simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as an enzyme called phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , with am@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine can lead to a lower level of plasma sensors .
the serum concentration of calcium blocks such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine
simultaneous treatment with A@@ generic ase can increase the plasma concentration of the plasma and increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ ics , sin@@ cer@@ ities and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ ate Plasma ( 4 times daily ) rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Kon@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval ( 82 % to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ generic ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ o@@ or@@ tic oids , unless the possible use of a treatment exceeds the risk of system@@ ic corne@@ al ero@@ id effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which is depend@@ ant on CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can be expected to increase the result of the plasma level upon reaching A@@ generic administration .
since plasma screens of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or may lead to my@@ opathy , including a sub@@ ab@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , combined use of this medicine with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is not recommended .
there will be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentration to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors , as the plasma key of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased to the simultaneous gift of Am@@ asi@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
hence , A@@ generic ase can not be applied together with oral it@@ ant Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while in case of simultaneous application of A@@ generic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advis@@ able .
data on simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eases can point to a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at Op@@ iat@@ ric symptoms , especially if additionally , low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given next .
due to its extremely low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given , such as Am@@ on@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose can be treated when am@@ ni@@ b@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies together with A@@ generic ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ o effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended in the same gift of A@@ generic ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied by careful consideration of the possible user for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected in milk lac@@ ri@@ mal rats , but it is not known whether am@@ ni@@ b@@ r passes into the mother &apos;s milk .
a reproduction Study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ dation in the uter@@ us up to the end of the breast@@ feeding , showed a dimin@@ ishing increase of 12 body weight during the down@@ time .
further development of the seed , including he@@ at@@ ility and reproduction , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the ir@@ reversible of A@@ generic asis was investigated in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side @-@ related side effects related side effects were mild to moder@@ ately , occurred early on and rarely lead to treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether in connection with the intake of A@@ generic medicines or other medicines applied to HIV medicine , or whether they are a result of under@@ gone disease .
most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have not received 1,200 mg of A@@ generic ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were standing by the investig@@ ators as in connection with study medicine and more than 1 % of patients , were performed as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy has been associated with an re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ ph@@ ie ) with HIV patients , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ als and skin fatty tissue , more intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ony of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ ato fat accumulation ( Sti@@ fter ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ active ones , which were treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ ine over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was observed only a case ( st@@ acks ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .

the cover of efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ed A@@ generic A@@ generic Study is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in trials , A@@ generic ase has been administered three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was not given a low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) who together with A@@ generic N@@ R@@ TI@@ s were given .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Bas@@ ed on these data should be considered to be considered as an expected benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; A@@ generic application with PI pre @-@ treated kids .
after oral administration , the medium duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase , for C@@ max reduction by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given to am@@ ni@@ b@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ ni@@ b@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
thus , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous quot@@ ation is influenced by the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg ) and can be reduced to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of active substance in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ born am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , which represents the active portion , is likely to remain unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ connected am@@ b@@ abo@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients during the dos@@ ing interval during the dos@@ ing interval in the Ste@@ ady state during the dos@@ ing state of C@@ max , ss by C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicine we need to in@@ duce or in@@ hi@@ bit or in@@ hi@@ bit a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , with caution being given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ generic ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ use@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with an dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ use@@ avi@@ r is made of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ generic solution and A@@ generic capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams basis .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gi@@ bly neg@@ li@@ gi@@ bly , hence the effect of a kidney function to the elim@@ ination of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these therapy schem@@ es lead to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma sensors that can be obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1,200 mg of Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous access to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity with Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats appeared in male animals of ben@@ ig@@ ne to@@ dd@@ lers , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( M@@ ice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - multiple ( rats ) of exposure to people , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ ni@@ b@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of he@@ p@@ to@@ he@@ aters and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been cleared up and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear .
the present exposure data on people , both clinical trials and therapeutic use , showed little clu@@ es for the adoption of clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ et@@ tests , the bacterial , reverse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test at rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ations in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be demonstrated and demonstrated in clinical life by measuring the AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , clinical trials haven &apos;t been observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of A@@ generic purposes nor after the treatment .
studies with tox@@ icity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in the control animals and with the am@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated animals .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposure that was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of the therapeutic dosage was observed , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ju@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed .
24 If A@@ generic capsules can be applied without the increased addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses should be applied to am@@ big@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ ni@@ b@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ ni@@ b@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application should be performed in patients with weak or light liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function problems it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , are used methods to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ generic ase should be reduced to a duration of 27 , if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
increased risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a long lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it has been shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rology failure and resistance development .
508 % increased by 30 % for C@@ max , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in the plasma at the combination of am@@ ni@@ b@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg kel@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ ni@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) can be administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended to establish a clear monitoring as the effectiveness and irrit@@ ability of this combination is not known .
the treatment with av@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ orph@@ ic and sa@@ quin@@ abo@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be de@@ br@@ ated .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rology monitor should be carried out as an accurate pre@@ diction of the combination of am@@ it@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
if it is required for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in should be accepted together with A@@ generic ase , will result in a reduction in dose of rift in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available for this purpose .

in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ ate Plasma ( 4 times daily ) rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Kon@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval ( 82 % to 89 % ) .
in the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ bodies together with A@@ generic ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ o effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1,0 mg of No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r 22 % and respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used according to careful consideration of the possible user for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction Study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ dation in the uter@@ us up to the end of the breast@@ feeding , showed a dimin@@ ishing increase of body weight in the seed .
the ir@@ reversible of A@@ generic asis was investigated in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of an over@@ dose the patient is observ@@ able to observe an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures necessary .
an@@ tivir@@ al activity in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ in@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r reserves his activity against some other prot@@ eases of the inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insulation ; the obtaining of this activity seems to be dependent upon the number and the type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the therapy optim@@ isation should be considered as the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; A@@ generic application with PI pre@@ treated kids .
while absolute concentration of un@@ linked am@@ ni@@ b@@ abo@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients during the dos@@ ing interval of the Ste@@ ady background during the dos@@ ing state in the Ste@@ ady state shall vary over the range of C@@ max , ss , and ss , ss , etc .
therefore , medicine we need to in@@ duce or in@@ hi@@ bit or in@@ hi@@ bit a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , with caution being given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gi@@ bly neg@@ li@@ gi@@ bly ; therefore , the effect of a kidney function in the elim@@ ination of am@@ it@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ n@@ ogen@@ icity with Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats appeared in male animals of ben@@ ig@@ ne to@@ dd@@ lers during dos@@ ages taken up to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( M@@ ice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - multiple ( rats ) of the people after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ ni@@ b@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of he@@ p@@ to@@ he@@ aters and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been cleared up and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear .
however , some evidence for the acceptance of the clinical relev@@ ance of these findings has resulted in clinical trials both from clinical trials and therapeutic use .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ et@@ tests , the bacterial , reverse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test at rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ rup@@ tive test in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was am@@ ni@@ b@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies with tox@@ icity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in the control animals and with the am@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated animals .
these results can be concluded that in young , the metabol@@ ites are not fully lined so that Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the phr@@ ase ( z ) .
A@@ generic remedy for inclusion is displayed in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral pharmac@@ euticals for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adult prot@@ eases ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children 4 years of age .
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ generic solution &quot; has neither been treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than from am@@ ni@@ b@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic intake capsules and solution are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to take in ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ gen@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2800 mg of am@@ ni@@ b@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation is to be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ generic term solution to fet@@ ch and low do@@ si@@ ated Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination of these patient groups can be avoided .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is not necessary for am@@ ni@@ b@@ r , an application of A@@ generic remedy for patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl alcohol content A@@ generic contamination is caused by infants and children under 4 years , during pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competent inhibit@@ ing of metabolism and might cause serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not result in HIV infection , and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ generic ase does not prevent the risk of transm@@ itting HIV to other sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , are used methods to determine the drug concentration .

typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ac@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis ( A@@ KS ) in the face or on the scal@@ p with immun@@ otherapy , and other top@@ ical treatment options con@@ tra @-@ indicated or less suitable .
closed on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday and leave to leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od can continue so long and continue to continue until all of the visible f@@ eig@@ n are disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the above treatment course should occur if intensive local inflammation can occur ( see Section 4.4 ) , or if in the treatment area , an infection is observed .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 @-@ 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only incomplete , a different therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose was dropped , the patient should apply the cream , once he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is applied in a thin layer and cleaned into the pur@@ ified , with ten@@ war@@ ts infected to the skin , until the cream is completely covered .
in these patients a deliber@@ ation occurs between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible deteri@@ oration of their auto@@ immune diseases .
in these patients , there should be a consideration of the benefits of treating a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk associated with a possible organ shot or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ is@@ thy@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ ose and one case with a circumcision leading to circumcision .
in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk of serious local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe skin irrit@@ ation is observed , which have caused a treatment and / or causing a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions were caused by the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty in the ur@@ ination to make an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experiences yet in the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Creme directly after the treatment of external defects in the treatment of external dispos@@ itions in the genital and the area date .
limited data suggests a higher rate of inc@@ lined reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown in this patient group in relation to removal of F@@ eig@@ ning , however , have shown a lower effectiveness .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line has not been studied .
local cre@@ ators are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases in generally during therapy or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if it is necessary due to the symptoms of patients or sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after re@@ generating the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of over 36 months after the treatment are available , other suitable therapeutic forms should be drawn in consideration .
in patients with recur@@ ring and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s , no clinical experience is recommended , so the application of previously untreated mel@@ an@@ omas is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) , a smaller lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy consists of .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip @-@ up area within the Lip Aug@@ r@@ ots .
only very limited data is available on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis in anatom@@ ic spots outside of the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis to the lower arms and hands do not support the efficacy of this use case , therefore such application is not recommended .
local cre@@ ators occur often , but these responses normally take in the course of therapy to intensity or go back to treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if the local skin reactions in the patient may cause great dis@@ comfort or very strong , treatment may be exposed to a few days .
from the data on an open clinical study , patients suffering from more than 8 patients would have a lower complete healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions .
in addition to the immune stim@@ ulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od can be applied with caution when treating an immun@@ o@@ anthrop@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
there are no direct or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ ö@@ tal development , the un@@ tie or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither after exceptional top@@ ical use of Qu@@ anti@@ fied serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the breast@@ feeding time .
the most commonly referred and as possibly or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in related side effects in the studies with three times of weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of pec@@ uli@@ ar ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
to the most commonly reported and possibly reported having the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28,@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are displayed below .
the most common , probably or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the related side effect were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
the side effects given by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ treated patients with ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis were listed below .
the evaluation of clinical signs demonstrated that these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream are frequently used to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ them ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ foli@@ ation / fl@@ aking / fl@@ aking ( 14 % ) and oil ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the clinical signs , the evaluation of clinical signs demonstrated that in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream used very frequently to severe wh@@ y@@ fish ( 31 % ) , severe jun@@ ctions ( 13 % ) , and severe jun@@ c@@ ation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials for examination of the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ pe@@ zie was determined with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment station or in the surrounding area .
the unique oral absorption of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , may lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the most severe side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg were norm@@ alized in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , system@@ ic concentrations of the alpha inter@@ fer@@ on and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 piv@@ ot@@ al studies phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in regards to a complete healing of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ od treatment was clearly superior to a plac@@ ebo treatment for over 16 weeks .
in 60 % of the combined patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the cow@@ ardi@@ zed patients were fully healed ; this one was 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a full healing was achieved with 23 % of 157 male patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared with 5 % of random@@ ized male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five times a week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target areas were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary intra@@ cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated has been clin@@ ically healed and also remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks weekly application in one or two treatment period of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week , treatment @-@ free period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic war@@ - les@@ ions within a co@@ hes@@ ive 25 c@@ m2 of treatment grounds as on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or in the face .
the interim data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show a recur@@ ve rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical examination after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of the expres@@ sive fung@@ i , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma did not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream has been investigated in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
in these studies , the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimum system@@ ic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od surface due to the skin of 58 patients with ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times of weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest oral concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ alled 0,1 , 0.2 and 1.6 g / ml in use in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 bag ) , in the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated refra@@ ctive time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half@@ way after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates a prolonged re@@ tention of the medicine in the skin .
the data for system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od showed that of patients at age 6 - 12 years low was low and comparable to that for healthy adults and adults with ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or superior bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal tox@@ icity at the re@@ at led doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg . kg to significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z @-@ weight ; one likewise had no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on Car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice participated in three days a week did not induced a tum@@ ors at the application point .
the relevant mechanism is not known , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only one low system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and not mut@@ ually is a risk for people due to the system@@ ic exposure due to the system@@ ic exposure .
the tum@@ ours emerged in the group of mice that were treated with the actual free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it can harm other people , even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the symptoms listed below are significantly affected or you are not@@ icing side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however its effectiveness ( by reducing its effect in relation to the reduction of G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was studied ) .
in children under five years of age , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me increased the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated kids demonstrated a normal large liver at the end of the trial .
the most common adverse events of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are ear@@ ache , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever , and reactions to the fusion station .
very common adverse events in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever , and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used to respond to patients who may possibly respond to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic response ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will see all new information that may be known , check and update this summary .
the manufacturers of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observe al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the International Commission of Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant type of the human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ Mamm@@ alog@@ y Cell Culture ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Eg@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is inde@@ xed to the long @-@ term enzymes in patients with a mu@@ c@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase defic@@ iency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a physician , which has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other physical met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosage scheme can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not measured , and for these patients no dosage scheme can be recommended .
patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me are able to develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any associated side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be eng@@ or@@ ously monitored , and an in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be available in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ ational devices are immediately available for medical emergen@@ cies .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , nearly all patients were to form Ig@@ G antibody against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related response must be treated with care ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
because there is little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , due to the theoretical higher risk reaction , the treatment must be c@@ auti@@ ous after an inter@@ ruption of treatment carefully .
treat 60 minutes before the in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or antibiot@@ ics ) to minim@@ ize the potential impact in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / im@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate on the half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
in the case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are associated with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / im@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
in@@ fusion can be resumed using a reduction in in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the response has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / im@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , which occurred the previous reaction .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase should be applied .
experimental studies not respond to direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exported to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase about breast milk , is advised to satisfy while treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the side effects in clinical trials were primarily associated with in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed at 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
unwanted drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma , which were observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or over , are listed in the following table for the following stages : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respir@@ atory phases and lungs , there were also severe reactions to , including bron@@ chos@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ atory and visual acuity ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted Drug influences in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma , which was reported during an Ph@@ as@@ e- 2 trial with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly moderate form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously every week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came to a ser@@ p@@ on version within 3 months , with the patients at the age of 5 ( average age of 5 ) compared to a ser@@ p@@ on version ( on average after 26 days over 45 days in patients with the age of 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature retirement from the study ) were found in 13 / 45 patients with immun@@ o@@ rec@@ cip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say , among them 3 patients with which it never came to ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version .
patients with missing up to a low antibody level showed a robust reduction in the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n , while in patients with high antibody tit@@ ers , a variable reduction of g@@ ag in hard@@ ship was noted .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed mar@@ g@@ inal to low @-@ neutr@@ alised effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which seemed not to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of anti@@ bodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of undes@@ irable drug actions , even if the occurrence of unwanted drug reactions typically co@@ inci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies .
the reas@@ oning for enzymes is located in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of accumulated sub@@ str@@ ates and preventing further accumulation of re@@ jec@@ tivity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is removed quickly from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ n@@ os@@ omes , most likely for man@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study enrolled 45 patients ( age 6 @-@ 43 ) .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of the patients showed the phen@@ otype and only one patient had the mas@@ cul@@ ine phen@@ otype .
patients have been recru@@ ited if they had an ongoing exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared to the plac@@ ebo group had an improvement in the pneum@@ atics function and the in@@ ability that is shown in the following table .
in an open extension study , an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks showed up to an Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as from the table below .
the decline of FE@@ W at the expected percentage is not statist@@ ically significant over this period of time and the absolute lung @-@ volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a hepat@@ oma gene , 22 ( 85 % ) had reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the g@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was determined , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in regard to the hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease presentation between the patient , which was taken into account of a combined end point for five efficacy @-@ variable ( 58 % ) , was generally assumed to be observed in 26 patients ( 22 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
one year &apos;s open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients was investigated at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the har@@ lot during the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas during the older patients with severe injec@@ tions only limited or no progres@@ sed in cogn@@ itive development .
in a Phase 4 study , tests to pharmac@@ ov@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different alt@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ es were performed on the g@@ ag mirror in the har@@ n , the liver oil and the 6 @-@ minute test test .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) which still does not have chemotherapy ( drug against cancer ) and is probably spread to other parts of the body , or is likely slightly spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ cell lung cancer that is not att@@ acking the epithel@@ ium cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients that have previously had not been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously had already used other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , patients during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , should be additionally given an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid defic@@ iency ) .
in patients whose blood image changes , or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be suspended or the dose should be decreased .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ ed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to its active form goes easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer effectiveness in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ thel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study at 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease were previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , were about an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9,3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously had received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta amounted to 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with which cancer did not attack the epithel@@ ium cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer periods .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued the company Eli L@@ illy Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. permit for the In@@ dependence of A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole European Union .
each screw @-@ out bottle has to be saved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary wick S@@ IS is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in to the first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell car@@ cin@@ oma , except in the severe panel of epithel@@ i@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line therapy of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al , or metastatic non @-@ small cell car@@ cin@@ oma , except in severe ni@@ hal@@ al epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
for patients with non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell car@@ cin@@ oma following the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
a reduction in frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions had to be given in the day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ administration and a day after the treatment of a cor@@ ti@@ dal ero@@ id .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third party course .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be prepared before every gift a complete blood picture , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a thro@@ cy@@ tic count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
in the beginning of a new treatment course a dose @-@ examination of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the kidney or the maximum hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the forec@@ asting therapy cycles must be carried out .
according to the recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) of the CT@@ C degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ F 3 ( except for neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient pre@@ serves to treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be cancel@@ ed if in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ reduction , a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity is 3 or 4 occurs or at the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials had no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or above , compared to patients under the age of 65 , was an increased risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to adequate data for infin@@ ity and efficacy .
in clinical trials , patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min are not necessary to carry out dose adjustments based on all patients recommended .
the data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( if any liver metast@@ ases ) is not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with regard to the bone @-@ mark supp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be given to patients before its absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ en@@ ity achieves a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ytes , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ths and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as observed in the preceding treatment cycles - the ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of level 3 / 4 of hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity such as ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia has been nar@@ rated if treatment was taken with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 .
all patients need to be treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ y@@ - lak@@ es@@ tic action to reduce un@@ conditional tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) , the simultaneous delivery of non @-@ ster@@ oid drugs ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days before therapy must be done at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended to be a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ time for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these inci@@ dents occurred , corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , prec@@ ed@@ itary blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid buil@@ du@@ p accum@@ ulate in trans@@ cellular space a drainage of eff@@ ected from P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment can be considered .
5 severe cardi@@ ovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were sometimes reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , simultaneous application is reduced ( except yel@@ lowing of yellow fever ; this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible rat@@ at@@ ability of re@@ productive ability consists of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before treatment - G@@ inn to get advice on the sperm power reserve .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid hormone ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can result in a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed cre@@ tion with a result of increased adverse effects of side effects .
therefore , caution is advis@@ able if patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be applied to high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ es@@ - only 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data will be presented to the interaction position as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , at least 5 days before the therapy , at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the ag@@ it@@ ant status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ bodies and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , when the decision was taken to handle patients with oral anti@@ bodies .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed during pregnancy , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected for the pregnancy of birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary and by careful consideration of the use for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive ability consists of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment course to get advice on the sperm line .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into the mother &apos;s milk goes and unwanted effects during the inf@@ ant inf@@ ant can not be excluded .

the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving clinical medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statist@@ ically significant improvement of clinical symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nei@@ c ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Pic@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ thel@@ i@@ om was shown in the application of the lung cancer symp@@ tom of the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ it T@@ in arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms pul@@ sed through an improvement in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function throughout time .

limited data of a separate , controlled Phase 3 study suggest that efficacy data ( survival and progres@@ sion free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 540 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the effectiveness of the P@@ Q population is consistent with the analyses of the ITT population and support the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination opposite the gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination .

al@@ an@@ ism is applied in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) as well as with chemotherapy regim@@ ens , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of al@@ xi can be increased by using a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicinal product , which can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as the effects in this age group did not provide enough information .
this means that the active substance prevents binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , which prevents the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
al@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens , which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy was not treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron in patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were not treated in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , over 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
compar@@ ing Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a approval of the company Helsin@@ g@@ Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , a permit for the course of transport of Alo@@ xi within the European Union .
al@@ xi is inde@@ xed : in prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting at moder@@ ately w@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the effectiveness of al@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding one before chemotherapy @-@ given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on por@@ ridge , patients with am@@ nesty fruit ip@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ strate I@@ li@@ us should be monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advis@@ able on the same gift of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the QT @-@ intervals or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or the intake of such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy with chemotherapy for chemotherapy , al@@ xi is to be used neither to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hibited the activity of the five investigated chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ist ( c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there are no significant pharmac@@ oc@@ ene interaction between a one @-@ time dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ es@@ - concentration of an CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one population based on a population of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ per and R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , chlor@@ am@@ ox@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , ran@@ iti@@ et@@ ine , t@@ elec@@ tr@@ ine , Ser@@ tr@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience on the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human gest@@ ures are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied during pregnancy , unless it is deemed to be treated by the treated doctor .
clinical trials were the most commonly observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) that at least al@@ beit with al@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and or@@ char@@ ds ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions in the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain@@ s ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience report .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar problems showed some adverse events such as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effectiveness .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the great mani@@ fold volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy at an al@@ oe over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hour ) received intraven@@ ously a day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hour ) .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and dac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine , 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were given to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , given to day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of clinical trials with moderate chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable with the appropriate effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion@@ ic channels involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation , and extend the duration of action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of I.@@ V. in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentration , a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) is generally in the whole dose of 0.@@ -@@ 90 μ g / kg in patients with patients and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean age ranged from day 1 to day 5 measured in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration of 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations proce@@ eded that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached the total value of 0.@@ 75 mg of measured value ; however , the C@@ max after the injection of 0.@@ 75 mg was higher .
approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic compounds containing in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron above fewer than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect at 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in vitro studies we have shown that there are CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , l@@ esser extent that CY@@ P2@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered ingredient made approximately 40 % of the given dose .
after a single @-@ time pre @-@ injection par@@ ak@@ ening was the total of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function inter@@ fer@@ ment the terminal elim@@ ination time and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , it is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are sufficiently exposed over the maximum human@@ ist exposure , which indicates a small relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 According to pre @-@ clinical trials , indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only be used at very high concentrations of ion@@ isation of ions , which are attri@@ but@@ able to vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure of human cancer ) which were given daily over two years resulted in an increased frequency of liver cancer , end@@ oc@@ r@@ ines ne@@ op@@ las@@ m ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ kre@@ as , ad@@ ren@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin cancer in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but as a result of the high dos@@ ages and as al@@ an@@ xi is determined for a unique application , the relev@@ ance of these results will be minimal for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the application for the use of hepat@@ itis C drug provided by Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million in the IE / ml injection solution was recommended .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on should re@@ semble a biological medicines called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug substitute that is already approved in the EU ( also known as reference agent ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepat@@ itis C ( a viral infection caused by virus infection ) .
for micro@@ scop@@ ic testing the liver tissue is damages , moreover the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in- amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) is increased to the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was applied to stim@@ ulate the substance of the substance .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on demonstrated data , that cover the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , function changes , safety and efficacy of hepat@@ itis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepat@@ itis C the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared to the efficacy of the reference dosage of 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured how many patients were treated after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of the treatment ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .

in addition , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the substance and the use of drugs are not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepat@@ itis C , which spoke to treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after adjusting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease in more patients fl@@ amed up than with the reference agent ; moreover Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
apart from that , the test conducted in the study was to test the question , to what extent the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( a skin infection ) and small in@@ infected la@@ under@@ ing ( R@@ iss@@ - or sa@@ wn @-@ w@@ ounds ) , de@@ preci@@ ation and se@@ wn wound .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infection caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because Alar@@ go against this type of infections may not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but with patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the physician should study the patient again and undergo alternative treatment in consideration .
it works by blocking the bacterial cells ( the parts of the bacteria cell in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
main indic@@ ative effectiveness in all five studies of patients whose infection was handled after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under alt@@ ar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were given to plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of infected @-@ w@@ ounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar contact : if the results of both studies were examined during skin w@@ ounds , about 90 % of the patients showed both groups on treatment .
in these two studies , however , was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was used in the treatment of ab@@ sz@@ essen ( eit@@ ful cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or of infections , which have been proven to be proven by M@@ RSA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the contrac@@ tor .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go were over@@ thrown during the short treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , sc@@ ul@@ sions , or wires w@@ ounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . , a permit for the inc@@ eption of Al@@ tar@@ go in the whole European Union .
the patients with which no improvements occurred within two to three days should be examined once again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sen@@ sibility or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine , the treatment is ab@@ orted to un@@ cover the oint@@ ment and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which M@@ RSA is known as path@@ ogen or assumed ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in clinical studies of secondary w@@ ounds caused the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin for patients with infections , which were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered in consideration if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment does not enter a improvement or a wor@@ sen@@ ing of the infected place .
the effect of the simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical products on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentration , which have been achieved when humans have been achieved using top@@ ical skin or infected surfaces , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 In con@@ current injection of 2 times a day , 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the average ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin for a reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure of top@@ ical treatment in patients , dos@@ ing adjustments may not be required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin will be applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction elast@@ icity after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are in@@ sufficient in terms of a statement regarding the birth and the federal financial / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the gift of an ic antibiot@@ ic .
in deci@@ ding , the breast@@ feeding continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go is to be continued / terminated is considering the benefit of the nur@@ sing inf@@ ant for the inf@@ ant and benefit of the ag@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go had been applied , the most commonly reported adverse events was about 1 % of patients concerned .
mode of action ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ k@@ util@@ in , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of the bacterial protein synthesis in the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial chromosome that differs from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acts anti@@ bacterial infections .
data indicate that the Tre@@ aties of ri@@ bos@@ om protein L@@ 3 are involved and associated with the ri@@ bos@@ om P @-@ binding agency and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ingen center .
by binding on this binding agent P@@ leu@@ k@@ util@@ ine block the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ benzene , block partially P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal development of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om sub@@ units .
due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some infections of infection should appear to be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ulator were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure on treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine and Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption in a study with healthy adults was applied 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine daily under Ok@@ clu@@ sion up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ mati@@ cal w@@ ounds , single plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling procedure was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients in front of Medi@@ ation and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum person@@ ic absorption per person was given to the top@@ ical application of 1 % oint@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of pe@@ eled skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the PGP in@@ hibition .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The Met@@ abol@@ ism in vitro was characterized by ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es primarily with CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepat@@ itis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children between the ages of 15 and 15 , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of one of two doses existing vacc@@ ination , whereby a protection against hepat@@ itis B may be reached only after administration of the second dose .
this reason , Ambi@@ rix is only allowed to be used when during immun@@ isation , a low risk of hepat@@ itis B infection is provided and ensured that the vaccine plan can be brought to an end from two doses .
whenever a r@@ ushing dose is undes@@ ired against hepat@@ itis A or B , Ambi@@ rix can also be given an other hepat@@ itis B or B vaccine .
vacc@@ ines act as they can teach the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; how it can defend against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and the surface anti@@ gens of &quot; alien &quot; and anti@@ bodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the acc@@ ine acc@@ ine of Twin@@ rix Kinder since 1996 and the acc@@ ine of Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are used , however , to treat the three vacc@@ ines to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults are administered in one out of three doses of existing vacc@@ ination .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are identical ingredients , some of the data that support the use of Twin@@ rix adults are also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indic@@ ative for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated kids , which had been developed a month after the last injection of antibody @-@ concentrations .
in an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between both injec@@ tions .
at between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated kids , Ambi@@ rix was a month after the last injection of the antibody drug against hepat@@ itis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of the Protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar at a six @-@ month interval between the injec@@ tions .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , appet@@ ite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ ur@@ ity ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix is able to respond to patients that are possibly allergic to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals . a permit for the ownership of the company concerned by the Ambi@@ rix .
the standardi@@ zation board with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ination boxes with the first dose to be given at the appointment of the election and the second dose ranges from six to twelve months after the first dose .
if a r@@ ins@@ ing vacc@@ ination is requested for hepat@@ itis B as well as for hepat@@ itis B , vacc@@ inated may be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vacc@@ ines or with a combination .
the anti @-@ hepat@@ itis virus and anti @-@ hepat@@ itis virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ hepat@@ itis virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) an@@ tigen levels are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the relevant mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ants vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully assured if immun@@ wle@@ d@@ geable persons who have been awarded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , because they may not be protected as protection , because it may well be protected from immun@@ ological anti@@ bodies by the immune system .
3 As with all injection components , for the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic response , such opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring may always be available immediately .
if a faster protection against hepat@@ itis B is needed , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended to combine 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ less in@@ active hepat@@ itis C virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of ha@@ em@@ ulation patients and persons with mal@@ functions of the immune system , it is possible to have sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibody worth , so in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ ination may be required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ orter , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
in case of thro@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or hem@@ or@@ inter@@ ferences , Ambi@@ rix can also inj@@ ected , as it can occur in these cases to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration to bleeding .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mas@@ si@@ ma m@@ umps , the immune response was adequate for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy or for patients with immune defects , no sufficient immune response must be achieved .
in a clinical study that was conducted with 3 vaccine doses of these formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , pain , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache , and fever is comparable with the frequency which was observed in the previous thi@@ omer@@ ic and pre@@ servative @-@ containing vacc@@ ination formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix were given to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 and up to 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ities at a calculated base per vaccine , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix with 5@@ 0.7 % of subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses @-@ combination .
according to the entire vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,4 % of the subjects agreed to the Ambi@@ rix were over pain , compared with 6@@ 3.8 % for the subjects which were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combinations .
however , the frequency of Mat@@ ter was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. across the entire vacc@@ inations at 3@@ 9,6 % of subjects , the Ambi@@ rix was compared with 3@@ 6.2 % for the subjects which received the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination .
the incidence of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ities was low and comparable to that , which was observed after administration of combining the combination of 3 doses .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ines the occurrence of local reactions and general reaction in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to the hepat@@ itis C virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combined hepat@@ itis B vaccine .
however , in the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , however , was reported a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .
the share of vacc@@ ines that have severe side effects during the 2 @-@ cans oc@@ tag@@ as with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans oc@@ top@@ as with combined hepat@@ itis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B @-@ B@@ - surface an@@ tigen , was statist@@ ically not different .
in clinical trials that were performed in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9,1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for the month of 6 given dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for the month of 6 given dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year olds , 142 two doses Tox@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined fabric with three doses .
at the 289 persons whose imm@@ unity was ex@@ cre@@ able , the serum rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ vaccine .
the immune response , which was reached in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in the month of 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses of in@@ oc@@ ulations with Ambi@@ rix or 3 @-@ cans oc@@ ulations with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B @-@ B and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B @-@ Surface an@@ tigen .
persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years old were able to prove the consistency of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ bodies over at least 24 months after the immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine .
the immune response to both anti@@ gens observed in this study was comparable to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses , consisting of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepat@@ itis B and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combined hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ bodies were compared 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ inations .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the in@@ dem@@ ni@@ fication of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ination , in@@ activated Poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ination , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens adequate .
a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults was demonstrated to present formulation similar to serum samples and ser@@ ok@@ on@@ sion rates as for former formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the reset level on any foreign particles and / or physical changes .

the hepat@@ itis virus virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but may also be transmitted by other ways than by bathing in water contam@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , an pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect from an infection with hepat@@ itis virus or hepat@@ itis B virus , even if the full vaccine series was completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are infected with hepat@@ itis virus or hepat@@ itis B virus in the administration of both vacc@@ ines ( although you / your child does not feel un@@ comfortable or ill / feel ) a vaccine may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that harm the liver or symptoms that are similar to those of hepat@@ itis B or hepat@@ itis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• When your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can result in it@@ ching skin rash , asthma or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have occurred in your child an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepat@@ itis A or hepat@@ itis B , if you / your child have a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly create a protection against hepat@@ itis B ( i.e. within 6 months and in the conven@@ tionally agreed agreement of the second vaccine ) .
if a possible risk of infection with hepat@@ itis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepat@@ itis C / hepat@@ itis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components ( 360 EL@@ ISA units of a formal in@@ active hepat@@ itis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepat@@ itis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with low levels of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination before ending the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is spra@@ yed on people who are in the muscle and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child fold in a tick .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on the vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / she / her child receive further medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescri@@ bing ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated / has been given or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( anti@@ bodies ) or has been planned or that in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepat@@ itis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is at the same time has to be treated with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible limbs .
when Ambi@@ rix was given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix can not be administered during pregnancy or l@@ act@@ ating women , except for hepat@@ itis A and Hepatitis B .
important information on certain other parts of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( anti @-@ antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on data , which has become known for the first approval of the first permit for the inc@@ eption , CH@@ MP noted the benefit of the benefits of the Ambi@@ rix .
since Ambi@@ rix , however , is only limited in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited because of the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ i@@ ak@@ age concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ium is served - devi@@ ded to several single doses to the meals alone , mixed by the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ et ( by the abdominal wall in the stomach ) or a Nas@@ en@@ onde ( induced by the nose in the stomach ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study since the children of Ammon did not compare with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo , i.e. without an active agent ) .
ammon@@ ium can also result in appet@@ ite loss , an abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , block@@ age , skin rash , skin rash or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ium in patients with disorders of the urea cycle is effectively avoided .
ammon@@ ium has been approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; as a result of the approval of the disease at the time of approval , limited information about this drug .
it is inde@@ xed in all patients with a complete en@@ um@@ age of enzyme already manif@@ ested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manif@@ ested form ( in@@ complete enzyme defective , which manif@@ ests itself after the first life month ) there is an indication for the use when in the history of the history of gene@@ alog@@ ical En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy .
for infants , not able to swal@@ low up tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account of protein toler@@ ance and the needed daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium meth@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg and for adol@@ es@@ cent and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early manifest defic@@ iency of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synthetic or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ ce bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required at a time of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ synthetic vitamin defic@@ iency have to receive arg@@ in@@ ine in an dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is risk for the birth of est@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ her@@ a if the tablets does not reach the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g of sodium meth@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be applied to patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency as well as with sodium re@@ tention and oil de@@ formation , only with caution .
because Met@@ abol@@ ism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium meth@@ ylene gly@@ ph@@ ate has been taken over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied with extreme caution on patients with liver or kidney failure .
the meaning of these results in respect to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in a sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat of young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it became a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal tasting and to a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a del@@ usion of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into the mother &apos;s milk , and for that reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the lac@@ tation is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients have at least one undes@@ irable event ( AU ) and at 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
frequency is defined as : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic female patient who has been using a met@@ abolic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy associated with l@@ act@@ acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ avi@@ an , periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
the case of an over@@ dose stood at a 5 @-@ month old inf@@ ant with a acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go on an accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat , which showed a dose @-@ limit@@ ing neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity in a intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat is a met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed active connection , which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl to phen@@ yl@@ amine glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
ker@@ os@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea is comparable ( both compounds containing 2 nit@@ ric oxide ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suited as an alternative carrier for the determination of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with mal@@ functions of the urea cycle can be assumed that every gram of meth@@ ylene gly@@ cem@@ y@@ rate can be used between 0.@@ 12 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms of new@@ bor@@ ns was earlier almost ever f@@ aust and the disease himself led to death with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , in the first year of life to death .
due to ha@@ em@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative means of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium zo@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium discharge of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ ally ( but within the first life @-@ month ) to increase diagnostic diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were treated before the first occurrence of a hy@@ per en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy was demonstrated , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was diagnosed with many intellectual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical deficit .
in patients with a late @-@ manif@@ ested form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ inal form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ ce bam@@ y@@ las@@ e defic@@ iency ) which were treated by a hyper@@ op@@ ic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium meth@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet was 98 % .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are already very reversible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ al@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ dised to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney disease with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its Met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate for patients with disorders of the urea @-@ cycle , ha@@ em@@ ulation and repeated gifts of oral dos@@ ages of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also studied for cancer patients with an intraven@@ ous administration of Na@@ zi@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ al@@ y@@ al in tablet form , 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ion plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate have been established .
in the majority of patients with urea disorders , or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ op@@ opath@@ ies , in different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning no Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat in plasma was det@@ ectable .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated using So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher compared to the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium meth@@ ylene gly@@ ph@@ ate had no toxic effects of toxic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken or@@ ally taken ( infants and children who still don &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets or patients with can@@ opy ) or a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ ard or a Nas@@ en@@ onde .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium meth@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate is : 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg and for adol@@ es@@ cent and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine , serum samples in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early manifest defic@@ iency of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synthetic or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ ce bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required at a time of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium meth@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium meth@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
when rat dro@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etat ( active met@@ abo@@ lit , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , there came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic female patient who has been using a met@@ abolic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy associated with l@@ act@@ acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ avi@@ an , periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea is comparable ( both compounds containing 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suited as an alternative carrier for the discharge of excess
on the basis of exam@@ inations on phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with mal@@ functions of the urea @-@ cycle can be assumed that every gram of meth@@ ylene gly@@ cem@@ y@@ rate can be used between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are already very reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ al@@ y@@ al in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ion plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate have been established .
during the duration of durability , the patient can be un@@ loaded the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient must receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium meth@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare ill@@ nesses , certain liver enzymes are ab@@ sent , so that they can accum@@ ulate the nitrogen @-@ containing products that are consumed by the intake of proteins in the body .
when you check laboratory tests , you must inform the physician that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium discharge the results of certain laboratory studies .
taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescri@@ ption medicine .
during down@@ time , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine could harm breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , em@@ in@@ som@@ nia , em@@ in@@ eness , memory faul@@ ts and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed .
if you encounter any of these symptoms within you , contact your doctor or your hospital emergency room to get in contact with your doctor .
if you forget the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dosage as soon as possible with the next meal .

if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox is used in all@@ some administration or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another anti @-@ anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I compared to a GP@@ I .
while the PCI was used to treat the patient a st@@ ent ( a short tube in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , like Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year , as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ went one PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective in all indicators as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for heavy bleeding in which it was more effective than Hep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox may not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other stags or any of the other ingredients .
moreover , it may not be applied in patients who recently had a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age , as well as with people with strong blood pressure or serious kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that angi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve approval of the agency of An@@ gi@@ ox throughout the European Union .
for treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non@@ - ST / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in an emergency raid or if an early intervention is en@@ vis@@ aged .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous combination of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in another row a PCI should be given an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg and in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery at 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after clinical results , the reduced in@@ fusion dosage can be recovered from 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours after clinical conditions .
immediately prior to the procedure a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the input .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one of which immediately followed intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
security and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us @-@ gift from angi@@ ox is not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI surgery is planned .
if this value ( ACT is shortened after 5 minutes ) to under 225 seconds , a second bolt should be 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constit@@ uted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and administered intraven@@ ously using the application dose .
once the ACT score is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) that is treated with a PCI ( whether Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in vs ACS or not ) , a lower inc@@ iner@@ rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT score is below 225 seconds , a second one is given by 0.3 mg / kg , and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt brake again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which led to approval of II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , the ACT score was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us with no dose adjustment on average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox may be initiated 30 minutes after the completion of the administered intraven@@ ous un@@ question@@ ed Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of low @-@ molecular Hep@@ arin .
• High sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against her@@ ds@@ mi@@ ine • active hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or higher risk of blood due to a fault of the hem@@ ost@@ atic system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial infections . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even though in patients with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , most blood cells in the arter@@ ial spot points can occur in patients that occur in a per@@ k@@ ut@@ ant cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment as well as bleeding everywhere .
in patients who are treated war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a monitoring of IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be consider@@ ate to ensure that the value after radiation treatment is achieved before the treatment existing at Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine .
starting from the knowledge about the mechanism of anti@@ bodies ( Hep@@ arin , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of blood .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with thro@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ bodies , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters in any case can be monitored regularly .
experimental exam@@ inations are due to impact on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , in@@ sufficient or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes , which require a treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected in the abdominal wall , the upper th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm , or in@@ fusion as continuous fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin to regul@@ ate the glucose level or the insulin .
insulin @-@ insulin differs very slightly from Human@@ ité , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter form of action has as a short @-@ effective human@@ ist .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin @-@ type 1 diabetes in which the body can not produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body insulin can not operate effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was enrolled in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indic@@ ative for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ mop@@ ed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , in six months a reduction of 0.14 % ( of 7,@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison to a reduction of 0.14 % with insulin @-@ per @-@ insulin .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra as compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal operation .
A@@ pi@@ dra can not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin or any of the other components , or patients who are already suffering from hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may have to be adjusted , if combined with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Commissioner San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH to take approval from A@@ pi@@ dra to the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is to be used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ igh@@ s or wil@@ de@@ contamination by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal cavity .
due to the reduced glucose levels and the reduced insulin delivery , the insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
each change in force ( s ) , the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc del@@ aying , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin delivery ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin demand .
3 An in@@ sufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ ant diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ abe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these states are potentially life threat@@ ening .
the switch of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin should be under strict medical supervision and may be required to change the dosage .
the time of occurrence of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia depends on the insulin profile of the insulin dose and can therefore change with change@@ over of the treatment schem@@ as .
the substances which increase the blood sugar sens@@ ory activity and increase the inclin@@ ation to hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cop@@ ics , include oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ox@@ et@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , and sul@@ fa drugs .
in addition under the effect of sympath@@ iz@@ ol@@ ines such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and Reser@@ va the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ aline circulation are weak@@ ened or missing .
experimental studies on refra@@ ctive elast@@ icity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ itarian in relation to the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin injec@@ tions occurs in human breast milk but generally , insulin is not absorbed in the breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ dered after oral application .

heavy hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ cop@@ s with a vi@@ el@@ ess@@ ness can be given by a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given to a doctor by a doctor .
after glu@@ co@@ ag@@ onal injection the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the jud@@ ging item for the heavy p@@ itu@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood glucose levels by stim@@ ulating the periph@@ eral glucose levels ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gau@@ ze results are quicker and the effect is shorter than near hu@@ - man@@ em .
in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 , with type 1 diabetes , the insulin @-@ relevant met@@ ering range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0,15 E / kg demonstrated a proportional rise in the dose @-@ glucose tolerance effect , and with 0.3 e / kg or more , a proportional rise in the glucose tolerance effect .
insulin @-@ insulin has a double effectiveness occurring like normal human rights and achieves the complete glucose tolerance effect for about 2 hours earlier than humanity .
data from the data was visi@@ bly given that a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ ci@@ ary gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control was reached in 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin , which is 30 minutes before the meal .
was ge@@ ared in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ ial control was given a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ ial control that was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is turned to 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a similar gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as for human normal currents ( see Figure 1 ) in front of the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - previously ) before the beginning of the meal , which was given in a comparison to human@@ kind standard , the last 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal was given ( Figure 1A ) as well as a meal in front of a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
