<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Fund (EPAR) in which it is explained how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has decided to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your disease or treatment, please read the packet instructions (also part of the EPAR) or apply to your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melted tablets, as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres think and speech, hallucinations (listening or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and frenzy; • bipolar disorder sufferers, a mental disorder where patients manic episodes (periods of abnormal high mood) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abidfy will be used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and preventive manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased anxiety or behavioral disorders, if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be used or applied to the patient, to which swallowing of tablets is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use simultaneously other medicines, which are the same as Abilify, should be adjusted by the Abidfy dose.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of nerve cells to another.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is thought to be regarded as a "partial Agonist" for receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripianzol is like 5-hydroxycobalamin and dopamine, but in lesser extent than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin plays a role in schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder in order to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and its reoccurrence is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abidadvertised to prevent reoccurrence of symptoms has been investigated in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders, which were involved in increased disemary, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abicify was compared about twelve weeks in 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, which have been stabilised with Abilify, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilised with Abidfy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 Patients with Bipolar disorder associated with increased disemicism (another anti-psychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies change the symptoms of patients suffering from a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs melting tablet and absorbs the solution.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection-solution patients who received Abicify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger decrease of symptoms increased to the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify was in four of the five short-time studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify hindered up to 74 weeks as a placebo. later, manic episodes have been diagnosed with previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify-injections in 10- or 15-mg doses had a more effective than placebo perceived to relieve symptoms and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abicify to take (observe with 1 to 10 of 100 patients), accreditation (nausea), earache (dizziness), saliva hypersecretion (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety (sleep disorders), anxiety (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal drug (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in bipolar-I disorder as well as with the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes on the treatment with Aripianzole, opposed to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solutions in rapid control of increased anxiety or patients with manic episodes in patients with manbipolar disorder or patients with manbipolar disorder sufferers, if an oral therapy is not appropriate, over with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the incinerator of Abidadvertised throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar-ion disorder and prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day for a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of the meals as mono or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-ion disorder patients ≥ 65 years has not been proved.</seg>
<seg id="33">A lower initial dose of this patient's group should be considered to be considered a lower initial dose when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is set off from combination therapy, the arithmetic dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suiciary behaviour belongs to psychological disorders and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of antipsychotic treatment, also with treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with Bipolar disorder does not have an increased risk of risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, chronic heart failure, hypovolemia, treatment with blood-depressive drug) or hypertension (including acute decelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports over during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients are diagnosed with ABILIFY, patients and symptoms of a late dydynia can occur in consideration to reduce or break the dose.</seg>
<seg id="40">If patient signs and symptoms are developed to indicate a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics have to be deposed including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used in patients with varicism or with states that are associated with campfancies in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with arithmezol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripianol, increased death risk compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dose and preparing for unwanted cerebrovascular events treated with Aripiaol-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases, extremely and associated with Ketoazide or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessment for hyperglycaemies-related adverse events of patients treated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus, or risk factors of diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally used in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Because of the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable if Aripianzol should be taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 blockagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripipezole, but this effect decreases as clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers an highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripipezole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should have similar dose-reducers.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolites can result combined with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of the CYP2D6 extensible metabolic sealing.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one goes into account the common gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY should not exceed potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteases can have similar effects, and therefore similar can-reducing can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be raised to the dose height prior to commendation.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram (or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be expected with a moderate increase in the arithmetic concentration.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripipezole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextrophyric / 3-methodology), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextrophyorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy while treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data base for humans and safety, this drug may not be applied during pregnancy, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics the patients need to be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripianzole has no negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects are more common (≥ 1 / 100) more than in placebo or were classified as possible medical-relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">Incidence of the side effects listed below are defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks appeared in patients who were treated with Aripiquzol, a total lower incidence of 25,8%) of EPS, including parkinsonism, acathetic and dyskinesis, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of EPS 19% in patients with arithmezol treatment and 13,1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiquzole and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I error - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS amounts to 23.5% in patients under Aripiquzol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, EPS 26.6% was attributable to patients under Aripiquad treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term phase of patients over 26 weeks for placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.2% was applied to patients under Aripipezol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between patient groups under Aripiquzol and placebo, which resulted in significant clinical analyses of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters resulted in no significant significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripipezole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">In addition to the side effects associated with an antipsychotic treatment, the malignant neuroleptiles Syndrome, Spätdyskinesis, and increased mortality with dementia cases, symptoms of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">Clinical trials and since the market launch were observed inadvertently or deliberately acute overdossification with Aripigezole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg, with no death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are no information about the effectiveness of a tick control in the treatment of an overdose with Aripianzole. however, it is unlikely that hematalysis is in the treatment of an overdose of use, as Aripiprazol has a high plasma glucose connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripipezol is mediated in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder on the combination of a partial protagonist effect on dopamine and 2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripianzol showed a high affinity for dopamine and D3 receptor and to serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT7-, for the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrengen and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the administration of Aripipezole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks in healthy volunteers, the position of the target of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor-lign, at Nucleus caudatus and at Putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripianzole a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled study, 52 was the proportion of respondents that followed an account of study medication in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg - Depression-Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement over Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the back rate, which was 34% in the Aripiquad Group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study during schizophrenia was more than 26 weeks, in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with a flexible dose over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior improvement in the reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder compared to placebo no superior efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled Monotherapy studies with 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I error, with or without psychological characteristics, Aripiprazol showed an adverse effect similar to placebo with lithium or Haloperidol fair in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In Week 12, Aripiprazole also proved a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on like lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without mental characteristics, which are partially over 2 weeks not on lithium, or valproat monotherapy conducted a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to the chemotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10. in a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, Aripiquzol showed themselves in regard to placebo with regard to prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in prevention of a recovery in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP2A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydration and hydration of Aripiprazole, the N-dekyamylation is catalyzes by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshalbillage is approximately 75 hours for Aripiquzol at extensive metabolic rollers through CYP2D6 and at approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism about CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripiprazol, there are no differences in the pharmacokinetic between male and female volunteers, and also showed no gender-dependent effects in a pharmacokinetic study.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation of the pharmacokinetic has no reference to clinically significant differences in the ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetic.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripipezole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">One single dose study of subjects with different liver cirrhosis (child-pugh class A, B and C) did not show any significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function to the pharmacokinetic of the class C, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, reproduction toxicity, genotoxicity and for cancerous potential, the shape clinical data had no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures that significantly exceed the maximum dosage or exposure of human beings, they have limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">Effects include a dose-dependent by side effects (Lipofuscin pigments accumulation and / or parenchycell-exposure) in rats from 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to the average maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day (the 10fold of the middle Steady State exposition (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose when humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholesterol drug was determined as a result of the precipitation of Sulphate conjuction of the hydroxyz metabolites in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25-125 mg / kg / day (1-3 times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of found in the Sulphate-conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole have been found no more than 6% of the concentrations that were found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">These effects were observed in rabbits that lead to expositions of 3- and 11ms of the mid-level Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubless active ingredient which supports the relocation of the microtubules from the tubular tubes and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their depression.</seg>
<seg id="303">These stabilization leads to inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network which is essential for the vitational interphase and the mitotic membrane functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albani conveys the transocytosis of Plasmacomponents into the endothelial cells and in the framework of in-vitro studies prove that the presence of Albumin conveys the transport of paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transgenotheliale transport is conveyed by the gp-60 aluminumreceptor and due to the alumininert Proteins SPARC (spected protein acidic rich in cysteine), a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two unfold-blind studies and of 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of about 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received every 3 weeks for treatment with paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as 3-hour infusion with premediation to the prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without pretreatment (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had an impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metalysts.</seg>

<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid clinical tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane-Gift (43%) than after a solvent containing Paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and rifice stories, Paclitaxel is primarily metabolized by using two smaller Metabolites (3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was the mean value of the unaltered substitute of 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="369">Abseamed was induced as an injection in a Vene as part of a main study with 479 patients who were suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected at least eight weeks before Eprex / Erypo had been injected at a junction previously or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicative for efficacy was the change of hemoglobinders between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects were investigated by the skin specklamed Abseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who were induced by kidney problems, the hemoglobinaries of patients who were amed on Abseamed were able to maintain the same degree as in those patients who continue to get Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In contrast to this, the patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo, an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stealing migratory headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be applied to patients who may possibly have hypersensitive (allergic) against epoxy or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems, as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions.</seg>

<seg id="387">An increase in hemogloins by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin associated with or below the hemoglobin target can be observed.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobinvariability a corresponding dose of dosing should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin is increased by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent hemoglobinaries exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epochal alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Fund (EPAR) in which it is explained how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has decided to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes), in which metformin (especially overweight patients) is not shown. • It can be used together with another diabetic medication (therapy medicine).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin patients (especially overweight patients), patients with metformin alone can not be satisfactory in the highest tolerable dose alone.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfa resin or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfa drugs or insulin can be maintained, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reducing the dose of the sulfa drugs or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be utilized and the blood sugar level drops, which makes type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos has been examined in tripletherapy; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfa resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, concentration in the blood was measured in the blood (glycaine hemoglobin, HbA1c) which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos lead to a reduction in the HbA1c value, which indicates that the blood sugar levels have been reduced by 15 mg, 30mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study the effect of an additional gift from Actos remained an existing treatment with metformin and a sulfa resin in a decrease of the HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study involving the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients the patients who also had Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease of the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were visual disorders, infections of the upper respiratory tract, weight gain and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be applied in patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) to Pioglitazon or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic Ketoazide (high concentration of acid - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin patients in which metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000 the European Commission granted the "Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited adopted a permit for the transport of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other hand the signature "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and in cases metformin due to contraindications or intolerability (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor (e.g.: early heart attacks or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oil, especially those with reduced cardiogenic reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">In signs and symptoms of heart failure, patients should be observed if Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular disease with Pioglitazon was performed in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports on cardiac sufficiency appears, which resulted in an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased input liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit for normal range) or with other signs of liver illness, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased till 3 times the maximum limit of the norm range, the liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control.</seg>
<seg id="773">If patient symptoms are developed to point out to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unsolved nausea, vomiting, abdominal breathing, fatigue, appetite and / or darker Harn, are the liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon is continued until the procedure of the laboratory can be guided by the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon a dose-dependent weight gain was detected, that can be stirred from fat deposits and in some cases connected with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a consequence of a hemodilution with Pioglitazon a minor reduction in the medium hemoglobin (relative reduction of 4%) and hematrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed for comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of the hemogrits by 3-4%) and to a lower extent also in patients with sulfa drugs and insulin (relative reduction of the hemogrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin-sensitive patients in patients with Pioglitazon as oral or triple-combination therapy with a sulfa resin, or as a branch combination with insulin, the risk of a dosed addictive hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, Thiazolidindia, including Pioglitazon, was reported on a occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular deacons with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear if there is a direct link between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of maculaödema, but the possibility of a Makulaödems should be aware of the potential of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary of messages undesirable adverse events regarding bone fragmentation, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated Fraktur was composed of 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) were treated in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to use a pregnancy or intake this entrance (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on investigating the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that become metabolized by these enzymes, such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium-channel blocker and HMGCoA-reductinhibitor are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC of Pioglitazon around 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pioglitazon, the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistant insulin is diminished, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the preoctal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; commonly &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare cases: unknown (not predictable from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the index of the lens, as they can also be observed with other hypoglycaemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT-Anascge came out over threefold the threshold range beyond the standard, but less often than in a placebo or sulfa drugs.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with precursors of advanced macrovascular disease was the frequency of a serious heart failure under Pioglitazon by 1.6% higher than placebo, when Pioglitazon resp.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch was seldom been reported in the heart failure under Pioglitazon, but if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="795">A comprehensive analysis of messages derived from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8.100 patients in patients treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients in comparative medication-treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the PROACTIVE study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">If taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not cause symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator), which results in the animal model to an increased insulin-sensitive skin of liver, grease and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose in the case of insulin-resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as a physiotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was upheld by Pioglitazon in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar were inadequate despite the 3-month optimisation phase with insulin, randomized to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon the average HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients who continued to take insulin; a reduction in the insulin treatment with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year, below Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinine quota was observed in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, an 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction in the plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol level as well as slightly, however clinically significant increased LDL cholesterol levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasmatriglycerides and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase of LDL cholesterol was observed, while under metformin and gliclazid lower values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial raised triglyceride levels, this is both an effect on triglyceride absorption and the pacetic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular disease in groups, 5238 patients were randomized with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is absorbed quickly, with the peak concentrations of the unaltered Pioglitazon normally within 2 hours of application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution from M-IV used to efficacy in approximately the triple of the efficacy of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">Following oral application of radioactive Pioglitazon in humans the marker was found mainly in the thread (55%) and to a lower extent in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination time of unaltered Pioglitazon is 5-6 hours in humans, and the entire active metabolism is 16-23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazon and its Metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearing are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys coincided after repeating plasma volume magnification with hemodilution, anemia and reversibly excentric heart hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under the treatment of Pioglitazon, the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistant insulin is reduced by the metabolic substrates which will reduce the preoctal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased inconsistencies of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) induced the urinary epithous epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a veterinary model of the family spinal polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazolidindions led to an increased frequency of colontumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "30" and on the other hand the signature "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated Fraktur was composed of 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) were treated in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study over two years the effects of combination therapy of metformin each have been examined with Pioglitazon or Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, below Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinine quota was observed in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial raised triglyceride levels, this has an effect on the tryglyceride absorption and also the patic Tryglizard synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the objective of its primary endpoint, a combination of the overall mortal infection, stroke, akutonic coronarisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, put the results in close that with the intake of Pioglitazon are not related any cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "45" and on the other hand the signature "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarizing analysis of messages from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who received comparative medication, showed an increased incidence of bone fragmentation among women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) were treated in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial raised triglyceride levels, this has an effect on the triglyceride absorption and the pacetic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane has been involved in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin and type 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to use insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">The study found the concentration of a substance (glycaine hemoglobin (HbA1c) after 12 weeks, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c reflections that indicates that the blood sugar levels were greatly reduced as strongly as with another humanity.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied in patients that may possibly have hypersensitive (allergic) to human digestion (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, doses of Actraphane may need to be adapted if combined with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar (the full list is valid for the package age).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Actraphane were overthrown during the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002 the European Commission granted the Novo Nordisk A / S company approval for the acquisition of Actraphane in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily, if a quick initial effect is pressed together with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection pin has to be placed under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose hemorrhage was significantly improved by a intensified insulin therapy, the hypoglycemia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any amendment to the strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting insulin, long-acting insulin, human body or insulin delivery) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA compared to insulin in animal origin) may cause a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If changing to Actraphane can be necessary in the patient with a dose adjustment, it may be necessary during the first time or within the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients receiving hypoglycemia reactions after a change from animal on human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemia were less pronounced than with their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Prior to travelling, which should go over several time zones, the patient should be advised to get the advice of his doctor, as such travels may be applied or taken to other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore investigate possible interactions in the therapy and to ask about other medicines referred to in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 soar hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia which can occur in a non-sufficient diabetic therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>

<seg id="885">Disorders of the immune system articular - Urtikaria, Exanthem Very rarely - anaphylactic reactions, itching, gastrointestinal disorders, angiogenic, gastrointestinal disorders, breathing difficulties, heart beat, lower blood pressure and powerlessness.</seg>
<seg id="886">A hypoglycemia may, however, gradually develop: • Easy hypoglycums can be treated by oral feeding of glucose or sugar foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, candy, or sugar fruit juice with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1.0 mg) or glucose through the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum concentration will be reached within 2-8 hours and the total duration of the work is up to 24 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1404">The main indicative of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplant was cancelled after a period of a year (for example it was investigated as often a renewed organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis) was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more recent studies of 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients were performed with liver transplantation and studied with liver transplantation and studied as Advagraf have been recorded in comparison to Prograf / Prograft of the body.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors, who are familiar with immunossuppressive therapy and treatment of transplantation constants, should make this medicine or make changes in immunossuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure from Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplantation or an increased incidence of side effects, including subtypes or overrainfall.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolim formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changeovers of formulation or regimes should only be performed under the engaging control of an experienced physician (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosing adaptions must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tactile remains preserved.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dose of Advagraf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in the individual case and on blood levels (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After changeover from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus Valley nose should be controlled prior to the switch and over two weeks after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4 the systemic exposure was measured with both cases of liver and liver transplant patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus valley are recommended during the first two weeks of transplantation under Advagraf to ensure proper substance-exposure in immediate reproduction phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low Clearance, an adaptation of the adult dose can take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Other dose adjustments may be required later, as the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus can change in the process of stabilisation of the patient after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Recommended dosing - liver transplant prophylaxis of transplantation. the oral adsorraf therapy should start with 0,10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dose of dosing - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf have to be converted to a daily dose of twice daily dose of prograf capsules at once daily intake of Advagraf. this changeover is to take place twice daily with a dose of 1: 1 (mg: mg), based on the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After a changeover from other immunosuppressants on admitraf once daily the treatment with the recommended oral and liver transplantation should start daily for the prophylaxis of transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation in adult patients who have been converted to Admalaria is an oral initiation of 0,15 mg / kg / day a day to take.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other Transplances, although there are no clinical experience with Advagraf in pneum-, pankrein and darmtransplant patients in an oral initiation of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in rectal transplant patients in an oral initiation of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initiation of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the target range can be required in case of patients with severe liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since the kidney function exerts no influence on the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of Tacrolimus, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of serum creatine) is recommended to calculation of the creatine capsule and monitoring the urethra.</seg>

<seg id="1435">As Advagraf introduced a medicine with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may need several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials make it possible that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the vantage levels in the blood exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the lower blood levels of Tacrolimus are usually in the first time after liver transplantation usually in the range from 5 to 20 ng / ml, and heart transplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent therapy of liver, kidney, cardiac transplants usually blood concentrations were used in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has lead to serious adverse events, including transplantation or other side effects resulting from Tacrolimus sub-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolim formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changeovers of formulation or regimes should only be performed under the engaging control of an experienced physician (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 In the treatment of adult patients with transplantation treatment, which have been proven against other immunosuppresants or therapies, there are still no clinical data for the retardated formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">No clinical data for the retardation formulation of Advagraf have not been found for the prophylaxis of transplantation in adult heart transplantation and transplantation in children's age.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible effects, which may lead to a reduction in the Tacrolimus blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, or other plant healing agents (hypericum perforatum), or other plant healing agents during a treatment with Advagraf. (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of tactile concentrations in the blood, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases aggraf can be seen as a cardiomyopathy called aqueous hypertrophie, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders, are an already existing cardiac disease, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, fluid effects and oils.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; hence, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus can be metabolized by CYP3A4 that may impair metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus can lower the clearing of steroid-contraceptives and thereby increase the hormone exposure, is very careful with regard to sensitive measures.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocate is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (one by the lack of factor VIII, congenital blood pressure disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application focus on whether an Advocate for the treatment of bleeding occurs in surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII lack, which causes blood clots like bleeding in the joints, muscles, or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa cannot be extracted from human plasma, but named after a method called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which they are capable of forming the human blood pressure VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is a medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is produced differently, so the medicine does not contain protein human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of severe and moderate haemophilia A, among them a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding as well as surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of advocates for the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new levels of blood level with "excellent" or "well" assessed.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advance (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances may not be applied in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) against the human ear factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the Baxter AG company for the Intranet of Advancement in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage A dosage and duration of the substitution therapy is determined according to the severity of the factor VIII-Mangels, according to the degree of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not drop under the specified plasma level (in% of the standard or in I.U. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours for patients under 6 years) can repeat for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute attacks are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6 to 12 hours for patients under 6 years) repeat until the danger is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment course, a corresponding dose of the injections of the administered dose and the frequency of injections is an adequate determination of the factor VIII-plasma cutting.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo Recovery and exhibit different halfway times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-Plasmaactivity cannot be reached, or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to suggest an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration of the administration should be directed at the end of the patient, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in treating patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII and IgG Immunglobuline, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml Plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlates with the degree of exposure to the factor VIII, which depends on the risk within the first 20 movement stage of the largest and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 precursor and anamnetable-known inhibitor development, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII-product, the inhibitors of (lowest) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Because of the rare occlwing of haemophilia A in women lie on the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) who have all previously untreated patients having a higher risk to create inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (each of 3 patients).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100), frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10.000 to 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not predictable).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval of the CHMP, the CHMP has continued to be rated as positive, but considered that the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore CHMP has therefore agreed on the basis of the security profile of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months required, the authorisation holder shall apply for a further extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP), officially announced that the company retracted its application for the use of an Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue, which connects other structures in the body, is affected and supported).</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a type of virus which is genetically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," that has changed so that there is no copies of yourself and therefore no infections can trigger when humans can trigger.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advoin would have been injected directly into the tumours and thus facilitate the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein that is formed from the undefective human body of the p53 gene, usually contributes to damage damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA can not be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni Cancer, where the p53-gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient prior to Li-Fraumeni Cancer in the area of sub-construction, which occurred in bone and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP concerns the company's answers to the questions asked, there were still a few questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the documents, initially submitted documents, CHMP has submitted a list of questions that will be sent to the company by day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP opinion has not been sufficient to bring Advexin Advexin to Li-Fraumeni-tumours benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee had further concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not sufficiently documented that an ecin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment, nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company didn't inform the CHMP of it whether the withdrawal symptoms of patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"modified drug release" means that the tablets are so composed of that one of the effective components should be emitted immediately and the other slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerunaze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), caused by an allergy to pollen (nasal detours) in patients with nasal muctival swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and teenagers over 12 years, the recommended dose of Aeroplan is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as soon as possible and terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), clutured.</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be put on the blockage of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main features were the changes of the severity of the fever blip symptoms, which were reported by patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed according to a standard scale, how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hypocrusupfene symptoms apart from the constipation of the nose, the patients who had flown with Aeropade decreased by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the weakening of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients suffer from Aeropaze a relieving of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who are Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerunaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speediness (inflammation), pharyngitis (calling itlessness), inconstipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleep sincerity), somnia and nervousness (insomnia), somnia.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeropol may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive against Desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other components, against adrenal agents or loratadin (another drug for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerunaze can also not be applied in patients who have caused hypertension (hypertension), ureteries (hypertension), hyperthyrophy (hypertension), hyperthyrootic stroke (hyperthymus), or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke (causing a hemorrhagic stroke) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On July 30, 2007, the European Commission granted the SP Europe to a permit for the transport of passengers on the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however it is to swallow (i.e. without them to crush or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerunaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data for irritability and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long term application the activity of pseudoephehedrine can take off with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the reduction in the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a physiotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (Mao) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity of combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrides such as broocripamine or other deongestiva, the peroral or nasal as abduced rhinoemulsion (phenylpropanolamine, phenyleazoline, ephedryolin, nigolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient's centrifugal and does not suffice to address corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerunaze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data do not suffice to address corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that treatment with the occurrence of hypertension or an Tachyon or of palpitations, heart rhythm, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or a reinforcement of headaches) has to be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups, patients with heart rhythm • patients with heart rhythm disorders • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in the history of diabetes, diabetes mellitus, bladder or bronchospasm in the history of history.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerunaze has dissociate at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamine has otherwise shown positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or reduce severity.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In addition to clinical exams with Desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were given additionally, however no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">With the results of the psychotropical tests no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and those treated with placebo were regardless of whether Desloratadin had taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme for the Metabolism of Desloratadin responsible enzyme has not yet been identified, so that interaction with other medicines may not be excluded entirely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4, and in vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drugs are not inhibits neither a substrate or an inhibitor of P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The insecurity of the use of aerobtains during pregnancy is not secured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancy, however no raising the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals not always transferred to humans and on the basis of the vasoconstrictor properties of pseudoephedrine, aerobbles should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases it may lead to a impairment of traffic or ability to serve machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular disease (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, fear, scraping, muscular deficiency, muscular deficiency, artery insufficiency, heart rhythm, dilapse, vomiting, nausea, vomiting, malicious pain, dizziness, Tinnitus, ataxia, sincereal, hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulating is especially probable in children as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouthness, pupil starbase and - dilatation, skin comfort, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-8 and IL-13 out of human mast cells / basophili as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-Selective on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">For a single dose-study with an adult, Desloratadine showed no effect on standard measurement sizes of the fluid, including the reinforcement of subjective hits or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily did not improve the frequency of drowsiness in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage may cause more sympathomimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, an speedometer or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal unusual rhinitis, where 414 patients received Aeropard tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies histaminantagonistic effectiveness of Aeropard tablets, determines the overall cores for symptoms (except of nasal muctival swelling), significantly higher than under a therapy with pseudoephedrine about the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerunaze tablets in regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal muginal swelling, was significantly higher than an chemotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerunaze pills showed no significant differences in regard to gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose-study on pharmacokinetics of Aerobaze, Desloratadin is detectable in the plasma within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of Aeropaze at healthy volunteers for 14 days, the flow-weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on Day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the framework of a pharmacokinetic multidoscope study, which was carried out with formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, four subjects died Desloratadin badly dependent metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components of interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent according to the gift of a aerinct tablet in the general form of pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, the toxicity at repeated gift, for genotoxicity and for reproduction, the preclinical data with the Desloratadine have no particular dangers to recognize humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no larger toxicity as their individual components, and the observed effects were generally in connection with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproduction of oxic studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not iterated at an dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the application for pharmacovigilanzines established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body-own substance to unfold its effect.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the launch of Desloratadin a very rare cases of severe allergic reactions (asthma, pipes of breathing, itching, hives, hives, and skin eruptions) was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Over cases of palpitations, heart hunt, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, diarrhea, painlessness, painlessness, painlessness, painlessness, painless disease and over cases of conspicuous liver.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablets, 5 mg- Lyonhelisat for intake (soluble chalets), 2.5 mg / ml syrup (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1,25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 mL syrup or resp.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children ages six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (among them four trials of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two trials in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of squares, impairment of sleep and efficiency on days) before and after six weeks of treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to intake and melting the fusion in the same way as the tablets and the application of children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In an allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were examined, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom (symptom percentage points) by 25 to 26% in the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urtikaria the decrease of the symptom after six-week treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to patients treated with placebo were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadin, laurel or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">January 2001 the European Commission granted the SP Europe to grant access to the European Community by Aerius in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet a day, with or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience of clinical studies on efficacy of desloratadin with juveniles from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should occur in accordance with the previous illness-laufer and may end up after the end of the symptoms and can reoccur again.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) patients may be recommended during the everyday life a constant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinical trials were not identified as part of clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were given additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the dose of alcohol and alcohol was not amplified by alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases it may lead to impairment of traffic or ability to serve machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical studies in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, with the recommended dose of 5 mg daily, 3% more side effects in patients with aerius were reported as in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that were reported more often than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), mouth fluidity (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years the most common low-effect headache has been treated with 5,9% of patients who were treated with Desloratadin and 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-phase study, at which up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (ninety clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-8 and IL-13 out of human mast cells / basophili as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses, the Desloratadine was administered at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days a day was not statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in the Desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1743">For a single dossier trial with an adult, Desloratadine showed no effect on standard measurement sizes of the fluid, including the reinforcement of subjective hits or tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as niesen, nose secretion and itching the nose, itching, trump infant and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be placed in dependence on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">An intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown in the overall cores of the questionnaire on the quality of life at Rhino-conjuncitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was representative of other forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathphysiology is very similar to the etiology in different shapes and chronic patients can be easier prospective.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine release is a causal factor in all urinary diseases, is expected that Desloratadin leads to an improvement in the chronic idiopathic urticaria in addition to improving the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving manuritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first tin-intervalls.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines, were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the rate of cancer by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin treated patients, compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and growth significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal rhinitis. population was higher in 4% of patients a higher concentration of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after a day of daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme for the Metabolism of Desloratadin was not identified yet, so that interactions with other medicines aren't excluded entirely</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug is not inhibits neither a substrate or an inhibitor of P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single-dosed study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, low calorie) do not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials performed with Desloratadin and Loratadin performed with a comparative degree of exposure of Desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences in relation to the toxicity profiles of Desloratadin and loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, genotoxicity and for reproduction, the preclinical data with Desloratadin can no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Colourless film (includes lactose-Monohydrate, hypromellose, Titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colorless film (includes hypromellose, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The remaining doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 are caused by an infection (see Section 4.4) and that no data are occurring, which support treatment of a infectious rhinitis with aerius treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respirations or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of the history of care should play a role in diagnosis, physical testing and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolized Desloratadin and experience a higher substrate (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Siris for children between 2 and 11 years, which is fully metabolized - is identical to children who metabolized up normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with severe problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose skin insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were given additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, equality of Aerius tablets and alcohol was not reinforced under the influence of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total stiffness of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar in the Aerius syrup-Group, similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported in the recommended dose of 3% more side effects in patients with aerius, when treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-phase study of adults and adolescents, at which up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (ninety clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11 were given as a result of an antihistamine dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years old) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin in adults and children can be similar, the efficacy data of Desloratadin can be extrapolated in adults on children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin dose of up to 20 mg daily, no statistically significant or clinically significant-cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) was used over ten days in adults, no extension of the QTc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents had no increased frequency of drowsiness in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">For an single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets were in clinical trials to no impairment of the Psychomotor.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinically pharmacological studies in adults it did not affect the simultaneous production of alcohol-induced performance impairment nor an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and youthful patients with allergic rhinitis, acerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as niesen, nose secretion and itching the nose, itching, tritching and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown in the overall cores of the questionnaire on the quality of life at Rhino-sttivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the seasonal allergic rhinitis caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving manuritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first tin-intervalls.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this fully metabolized phenotyps was similar in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacmacromodial parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multifunction study involving children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which metabolized and metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6x higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax lasts approximately 3 to 4 times higher with the terminal time of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for clinically relevant active ingredient pain after a day of daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially distributed the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of Aflunov to prevent the regulatory H5N1 submerenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu, which is caused by the flu (Type) H5N1 flu-virus infection.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine which could cause a trunk of influenza, which could cause future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A influenza pandemic breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus appears that can easily spread human beings because humans have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system contained in the vaccine contained parts of the Grippevirus as "bodies alien" and forms antibodies to it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in a position to make contact with a Grippevirus of this Staml faster antibody.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the aphragm of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which detects the human body as a body), was cleaned, cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This gave the scope of the clinical data base to assess the safety of vaccination, to meet the requirements of the EMEA region guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you participate in clinical testing and require further information on your treatment, please contact your doctor's doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years using the Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), which are caused by the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow their capsules directly, Ageneric ase is available as a solution for use, but this cannot be taken along with Ritonavir, since the safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Ageneric ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has tested the antiviral drug of the patient before, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Ageneric ase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Aging in combination with other antiviral drugs decreases the HIV-amount in the blood and holds it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not to heal, however, the damage of the immune system and thus can result in the development of infections related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Ageneric ase was investigated in combination with other antiviral agents, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who previously had not been treated with ease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The medicines that were low with dodised Ritonavir reinforced Medicines were compared with 206 adults who used earlier proteases, compared with other proteases.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main indicative for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-proven concentration of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the variation of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies of patients who had previously had no proteases had taken, after 48 weeks under Ageneric power, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml as under placebo, but Ageneric ase was less effective than inddinvir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Ageneric ase also reduced the viral load, but of the children who used to deal with proteases earlier, were only very few on treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study involving adults who were previously treated with proteases, this drug was treated with ritonavir amplified drugs to increase the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as other Protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came to a stronger decrease in viral load after four weeks than with the patients who farmed their previous proteases:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Ageneric (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), wind (nausea), vomiting, rashes and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Ageneric contamination may not be applied in patients, possibly allergic to amnibr or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Ageneric may also not be used in patients receiving currants (an herbal supplement for treating depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are the same as aging gases and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood to health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other drugs against HIV, in patients suffering Ageneric ase, the risk of a lifelystrophie (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteonectonic (symptoms of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndroms (symptoms of an infection caused by a soothing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">Finally, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ageneric application in combination with other antiretroviral drugs are used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Ageneric is usually taken along with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefits of Ageneric in combination with Ritonavir in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously had no proteases could have taken.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Ageneric ase was originally approved under "extraordinary circumstances" as the date of approval of scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited, a permit for the transport of people across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Ageneric ase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral pharmaceuticals for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteases inhibitor (PI) -pre-treated adults and children 4 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1927">It is usually intended to be given to the pharmacokineo booster of Amgenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of ambabor should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of ambabor as a solution to intake is 14% less than from amnibr as capsule; therefore, Ageneric intake capsules and solution are not exchangeable on a milligrams per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Ageneric ase capsules is 600 mg amnibr twice daily combined with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Ageneric capsules can be applied without the increased addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses should be applied to ambigase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Ageneric ase capsules is 20 mg of amnibr / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amnibr which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Ageneric ase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteases could not be investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Ageneric is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the lack of data for infinity and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with severe liver function problems at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function problems, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Ageneric ase can not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations, the currant (hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to risk of reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of amitavir during the intake of amnibr (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Ageneric or any other antiretroviral therapy does not result in HIV infection, and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Ageneric asis prevents the risk of transmitting HIV to other sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">It is usually intended to be used with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who are treated in chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy, have increased risk of severe liver disease with potentially fatal journeys.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing reduced liver function including chronic hepatitis or chronic hepatitis show increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under a antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous application of Ageneric ase and Ritonavir with fluticular or other glucoDoctor are not recommended to use it because the possible use of a treatment the risk of systemic corneal eroid effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the extraction of HMG-CoA-reductatin and Simvastatin be strongly relieved of CYP3A4, including hysteratin and Simvastatin for increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring the International normalised Ratio), are used methods to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients that use these drugs simultaneously, Ageneric can be less effective for reduced plasma sensors (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabodic interactions with Amgenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to alter the type of interaction.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadone is given at the same time with Amgenavir, patients should therefore be monitored at Opiatric symptoms, especially if additionally, low doses of Ritonavir are given next.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity according to the high propyl alcohol content of the Ageneric remedy, this formulation of treatment is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with care in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Ageneric ase should be absent to duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms, or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received anti-viral therapy including proteases, hyperglycemic or an exazheration of an existing diabetes mellitus have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had diseases to their therapy drugs were required which are associated with diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-related factors such as a long lasting antiretroviral therapy and associated metabolic disorders, associated with related metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hologophiles patients (type A and B) treated with proteases reports, reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous kutans hematology and hemorlistsen.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-viral combination therapy (ART) can develop an anti-allergic reaction to asymptomatic or residenistic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is adopted (including use of coronosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher Body-Mass Index), cases of osteonnecrosis were reported in particular for patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width athase can not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low-therapeutic width Ageneric ase with Ritonavir must not be combined with drugs, which are mainly mixed with CYP2D6 and are connected to higher plasma screens with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in AUC of Amgenavir, which can lead to a virology failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In an attempt to compensate the decreased plasma sensor by a dose of other Protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, were often observed undesirable effects on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum level of ambabor can be decreased by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with currant herbs (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taking St. John's wort, the Amgenavirus mirror and, if possible to suspend the viral load and seduce St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for any of the medicine is not necessary when clofinavir is administered together with amnibr (see also efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased by 30% for Cmax, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amonavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg Amgenavir were taken twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day that demonstrate their effectiveness and immacekeeping of this treatment schematias.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% moderated if amnibr (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was given.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amonavir in the plasma at the combination of amnibr (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg kelonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amnibabor (600 mg twice daily) can be administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amgenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended to establish a clear monitoring as the effectiveness and irritability of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinic study on use of Ageneric ase in combination with Didanosin, but is advised due to the antacid component of Didanosin, that the income of Didanosin and Ageneric ase are at least an hour apart. (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, with the gift of efavirenz in combination with amonavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with avavirenz in combination with amorphic and saquinabor is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be debrated.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapine to other proteases or existing limited data can be discouraged that Nevirapine may be sunk to the serum concentration of amitavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin could be less effective because of a reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma cutting.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virology monitor should be carried out as an accurate prediction of the combination of amitavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Amgenavir and Rifabutin resulted in an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in non-toxic effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is required for clinical reasons, Rifabutin should be administered in together with Ageneric medicines to reduce the dose of Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmaceutical-studies with Ageneric medicines in combination with erythromycin have not been performed, but the plasma level of both pharmaceuticals could be increased in the event of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fosamphivir and 100 mg kelonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily resulted in increasing the Cmax of Ketoconazole a day in comparison to the value that was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole a day without simultaneous use of Fosampabravir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can be applied together with aspects, may cause interaction.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored using toxic reactions which are monitored using these drugs if they are used in combination with aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteases, it is advisable that Antazida should not be taken at the same time as Ageneric ase, as it may come to resume disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous application of anticonvulsants known as an enzyme called phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, carbamazepine, with ambamazepine can lead to a lower level of plasma sensors.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Simultaneous treatment with Ageneric ase can increase the plasma concentration of the plasma and increase with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotics, sincerities and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times daily), the Fluticasonpropionate Plasma (4 times daily) rose by approximately 86% (90% -Konfidenzinterval (82% to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous gift of Ageneric ase with Ritonavir is not recommended together with these glucooortic oids, unless the possible use of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic corneal eroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor, such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, which is dependant on CYP3A4, can be expected to increase the result of the plasma level upon reaching Ageneric administration.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma screens of this HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor may lead to myopathy, including a subabyolysis, combined use of this medicine with ambabor is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There will be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentration to stabilization of the mirrors, as the plasma key of Cyclosporine, Rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased to the simultaneous gift of Amasiavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Hence, Ageneric ase can not be applied together with oral itant Midazolam (see section 4.3) while in case of simultaneous application of Ageneric Midazolam caution is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteases can point to a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with Amgenavir, patients should therefore be monitored at Opiatric symptoms, especially if additionally, low doses of Ritonavir are given next.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to its extremely low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given, such as Amonavir- dose can be treated when amnibr is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the simultaneous gift of warfarin or other oral antibodies together with Ageneric ase, an increased control of the INR (International normalised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weakening or reinforcement of antithrombo effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods are recommended for contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended in the same gift of Ageneric (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be applied by careful consideration of the possible user for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amgenavir-related substances were detected in milk lacrimal rats, but it is not known whether amnibr passes into the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction Study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the nidation in the uterus up to the end of the breastfeeding, showed a diminishing increase of 12 body weight during the downtime.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of the seed, including heatility and reproduction, was not affected by the administration of Amgenavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The irreversible of Ageneric asis was investigated in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side-related side effects related side effects were mild to moderately, occurred early on and rarely lead to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified whether in connection with the intake of Ageneric medicines or other medicines applied to HIV medicine, or whether they are a result of undergone disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side-mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with Protease inhibitors have not received 1,200 mg of Ageneric ase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were standing by the investigators as in connection with study medicine and more than 1% of patients, were performed as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy has been associated with an redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophie) with HIV patients, including a loss of peripherals and skin fatty tissue, more intraocular and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophony of the breasts and dorsozerato fat accumulation (Stifter).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroactive ones, which were treated with amonavir in combination with lamivudine in combination with lamivudine / Zidovudine over a medium duration of 36 weeks, was observed only a case (stacks) (&lt; 1%).</seg>

<seg id="2011">Skin rash were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or macrolopapulse nature, with or without itching and appeared spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously in two weeks without the treatment with amnibr.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonnecrosis were reported in particular for patients with generally known risk factors, advanced HIV-disease or long term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-viral combination therapy (ART) can develop an anti-allergic reaction to asymptomatic or residenistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In with PI pre-treated patients, which were observed 600 mg Ageneric twice daily with low-dosed Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), an exception of the triglycerid- and CPK values were observed with low-dosed Ritonavir, which occurred very often.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose the patient is observable to observe an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, are necessary supporting measures necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amgenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protein and thus prevents the process of viral gag- and gag-pol- polyproteinated polygons, not infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">Antiviral activity in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in both acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Heminkonzentration (IC50) of Amgenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0,08 µM in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronic cells</seg>

<seg id="2025">Genotypical interpretations of the analysis of genotypic interpretations can be applied to the estimation of the activity of amitavir / Ritonavir or Fosampleavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm is defined as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, I54A / C / S / S / S / S / S / S / T / V, I72A / C / M / S / T / S / S / T / S / T / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / M / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / M / V / V / V / V / V / V / M / V / V / V / V / V / V / M / V / V / V / V / V / M / V / V / M / M / S / T / V / M / T / V / V / V / M / T / V / V / V / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / V / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / V / M / T / S / T /</seg>

<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests, have developed clinical phenotypic cut-off (dividing points) for FPV / RTV, which can be applied to interpret results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to ambabor associated genprophetic patterns produces a certain cross-resistant against Ritonavir, sensitivity to Indinavir, nelfinavir and Saquinavir, though, remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There is currently data to be protected between Amgenavir and other proteases for all 4 fosamphavir resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on five-five antiretrospective substances, in which a Fosampavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), the imimavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), imimavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), imimavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), slamavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolation), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), babobabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates) and tiquavir / Ritonavir</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amgenavir reserves his activity against some other proteases of the inhibitor-resistant insulation; the obtaining of this activity seems to be dependent upon the number and the type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a different therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries that can affect the subsequent treatment adversely.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The cover of the efficacy of Ageneric ase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which with PI pretreated patients (standard of care, SOC) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with low formaldehyde contents.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Ageneric ase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the substudy A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-subsuperiority of APV / Ritonavir in comparison to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, in case of non-sub-volume threshold of 0.4 (10 copies / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of efficacy of unbleed Ageneric Ageneric Study is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In trials, Ageneric ase has been administered three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, and the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">It was not given a low-dosed Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI previously had at least one (78%) or two (42%) who together with Ageneric NRTIs were given.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of the patients included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered as an expected benefit of "unborn" Ageneric application with PI pre-treated kids.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the medium duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amgenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, for Cmax reduction by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given to amnibr (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amonavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amnibr 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Thus, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was uninfluenced by the food intake, although the simultaneous quotation is influenced by the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg) and can be reduced to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of Amgenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of active substance in plasma, whereby the amount of unborn ambabor, which represents the active portion, is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unconnected ambabor remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredients during the dosing interval during the dosing interval in the Steady state during the dosing state of Cmax, ss by Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicine we need to induce or inhibit or inhibit a substrate of CYP3A4, with caution being given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Ageneric ase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amuseavir exposure as in adults with an dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amuseavir is made of the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore Ageneric solution and Ageneric capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrams basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligibly negligibly, hence the effect of a kidney function to the elimination of Amonavir and Ritonavir should be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These therapy schemes lead to amonavir plasma sensors that can be obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1,200 mg of Amgenavir twice daily without simultaneous access to Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on the carcinogenicity with Amgenavir in mice and rats appeared in male animals of benigne toddlers, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (Mice) or 3,8- multiple (rats) of exposure to people, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amnibr.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of heptoheaters and carcinomas has not yet been cleared up and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">The present exposure data on people, both clinical trials and therapeutic use, showed little clues for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro-genotoxettests, the bacterial, reverse-lymphoma test, microkernel test at rats and chromosomenaberrations in human peripheral lymphocytes was Amgenavir neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be demonstrated and demonstrated in clinical life by measuring the AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, clinical trials haven't been observed in clinical studies, neither during the administration of Ageneric purposes nor after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies with toxicity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in the control animals and with the amonavir treated animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposure that was significantly lower (rabbits) or significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure of the therapeutic dosage was observed, however, a number of minor changes including thymus juongation and minor skeletal changes were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Ageneric capsules can be applied without the increased addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses should be applied to ambigase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Ageneric ase capsules is 20 mg of amnibr / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amnibr which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous application should be performed in patients with weak or light liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function problems it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring the International normalised Ratio), are used methods to determine the drug concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, however its effectiveness (by reducing its effect in relation to the reduction of Gag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was studied).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years of age, Aldurazyme increased the Gag concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated kids demonstrated a normal large liver at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of aldurazyme in patients at the age of over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are earache, nausea, abdominal pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever, and reactions to the fusion station.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common adverse events in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever, and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used to respond to patients who may possibly respond to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic response).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will see all new information that may be known, check and update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturers of Aldurazyme will receive patients who observe aldurazyme in terms of reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the International Commission of Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the transport of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant type of the human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using Cho-Mammalogy Cell Culture (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Egstock of the Chinese Hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indexed to the long-term enzymes in patients with a mucysaccharides I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be done by a physician, which has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other physical metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient carries this, every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosage scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not measured, and for these patients no dosage scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyme are able to develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any associated side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be engorously monitored, and an infusion of aldurazyme should only be available in an appropriate clinical environment where revitational devices are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, nearly all patients were to form IgG antibody against laronidase, usually within 3 months from treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related response must be treated with care (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, due to the theoretical higher risk reaction, the treatment must be cautious after an interruption of treatment carefully.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Treat 60 minutes before the infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antibiotics) to minimize the potential impact infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / imbuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of infusion rate on the half of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, heavy infusion-related reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are associated with antihistamines and paracetamol / imbuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed using a reduction in infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and paracetamol / imbuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction in infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, which occurred the previous reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquine or Procain, because a potential risk of interference with intracellular absorption of laronidase should be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies not respond to direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, which were exported to Laronidase about breast milk, is advised to satisfy while treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical trials were primarily associated with infusion-related reactions which were observed at 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyma, which were observed during the phase-3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or over, are listed in the following table for the following stages: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory phases and lungs, there were also severe reactions to, including bronchospasm, respiratory and visual acuity (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted Drug influences in connection with Aldurazyma, which was reported during an Phase- 2 trial with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly moderate form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously every week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came to a serpon version within 3 months, with the patients at the age of 5 (average age of 5) compared to a serpon version (on average after 26 days over 45 days in patients with the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or until a premature retirement from the study) were found in 13 / 45 patients with immunoreccipitation (RIP) Assay, among them 3 patients with which it never came to serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing up to a low antibody level showed a robust reduction in the Gag mirror in Harn, while in patients with high antibody titers, a variable reduction of gag in hardship was noted.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed marginal to low-neutralised effect on enzymatic laronidase- activity in vitro, which seemed not to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of undesirable drug actions, even if the occurrence of unwanted drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasoning for enzymes is located in one for the hydrolysis of accumulated substrates and preventing further accumulation of rejectivity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion Laronidase is removed quickly from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the lynosomes, most likely for manose-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study enrolled 45 patients (age 6-43).</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of the patients showed the phenotype and only one patient had the masculine phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients have been recruited if they had an ongoing expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute walking distance in the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study where they received another 3,5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme compared to the placebo group had an improvement in the pneumatics function and the inability that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In an open extension study, an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks showed up to an Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyme group as from the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decline of FEW at the expected percentage is not statistically significant over this period of time and the absolute lung-volumes increased further proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatoma gene, 22 (85%) had reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the gag mirror in Harn (µg / mg of Creatinine) was determined, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In regard to the heterogeneous disease presentation between the patient, which was taken into account of a combined end point for five efficacy-variable (58%), was generally assumed to be observed in 26 patients (22%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">One year's open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of aldurazyme in 20 patients was investigated at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased GAG- mirror in the harlot during the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-Score for this age group (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas during the older patients with severe injections only limited or no progressed in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a Phase 4 study, tests to pharmacovodynamic effects of different altdurazyme dosing schemes were performed on the gag mirror in the harn, the liver oil and the 6-minute test test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously every week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be represented in patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions, a represented alternative; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of this two dosage schemata is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate every new information that will evaluate each year, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug may be updated.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of alxi can be increased by using a Corticosteroids (a medicinal product, which can be used as antiemetics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, as the effects in this age group did not provide enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), which prevents the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Alxi was studied in three main studies on 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regimens, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, showed 59% of the patients who were treated with Aloxi in 24 hours after chemotherapy was not treated with ondansetron in patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi were not treated in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), over 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">Comparing Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a approval of the company HelsingBirex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a permit for the course of transport of Aloxi within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alxi is indexed: in prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strong emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting at moderately wetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of alxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding one before chemotherapy-given Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon porridge, patients with amnesty fruit ipation or signs of a substrate Ilius should be monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable on the same gift of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT-intervals or in patients with which the QT- interval is extended or the intake of such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy with chemotherapy for chemotherapy, alxi is to be used neither to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five investigated chemotherapist (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabubicine and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there are no significant pharmacocene interaction between a one-time dose of palonosetron and a steady states- concentration of an CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one population based on a population of CYP2D6-Inhibitors (dexamethasper and Rifampicin, chloramoxicin, fluoxetine, haloperidol, ranitietine, telectrine, Sertrine and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience on the application of Palonosetron in human gestures are not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied during pregnancy, unless it is deemed to be treated by the treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most commonly observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients) that at least albeit with alxi in connection, headaches (9%) and orchards (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions in the administration location (burning, hardening, complaints and pains) were reported in post-marketing experience report.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar problems showed some adverse events such as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out due to the great manifold volume, however, a dialysis is probably not an effective therapy at an aloe overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate-etogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 250 mg of ondansetron (half-time 7.3 hour) received intravenously a day 1 without dexamethasron (half-time 7.3 hour).</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine, 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were given to patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron, given to day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of clinical trials with moderate chemotherapy and the study with highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters were comparable with the appropriate effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ionic channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation, and extend the duration of action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the assessment of the EKG effects of I.V. in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentration, a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) is generally in the whole dose of 0.-90 μ g / kg in patients with patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean age ranged from day 1 to day 5 measured in the palonosetron plasma concentration of 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations proceeded that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached the total value of 0.75 mg of measured value; however, the Cmax after the injection of 0.75 mg was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolic compounds containing in comparison to Palonosetron above fewer than 1% of the antagonistic effect at 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies we have shown that there are CYP2D6 and, lesser extent that CYP2A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unaltered ingredient made approximately 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single-time pre-injection parakening was the total of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function interferment the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increases, however, it is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions that are sufficiently exposed over the maximum humanist exposure, which indicates a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 According to pre-clinical trials, indications that Palonosetron can only be used at very high concentrations of ionisation of ions, which are attributable to ventricular de- and repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure of human cancer) which were given daily over two years resulted in an increased frequency of liver cancer, endocrines neoplasm (in thyroid, pituitary, pankreas, adrenerenmark) and skin cancer in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but as a result of the high dosages and as alanxi is determined for a unique application, the relevance of these results will be minimal for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) approved a negative report in which the application for the use of hepatitis C drug provided by Alpheon 6 million in the IE / ml injection solution was recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicines called Roferon-A with the same drug substitute that is already approved in the EU (also known as reference agent).</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a viral infection caused by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">For microscopic testing the liver tissue is damages, moreover the values of the liver enzyme Alanin- aminotransferase (ALT) is increased to the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was applied to stimulate the substance of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon demonstrated data, that cover the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active structure, composition and purity of the drug, function changes, safety and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to the efficacy of the reference dosage of 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured how many patients were treated after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of the treatment (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the substance and the use of drugs are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which spoke to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After adjusting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease in more patients flamed up than with the reference agent; moreover Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test conducted in the study was to test the question, to what extent the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection) and small ininfected laundering (Riss- or sawn-wounds), depreciation and sewn wound.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infection caused by a methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against this type of infections may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but with patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days, the physician should study the patient again and undergo alternative treatment in consideration.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial cells (the parts of the bacteria cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Main indicative effectiveness in all five studies of patients whose infection was handled after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients were given to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected-wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar contact: if the results of both studies were examined during skin wounds, about 90% of the patients showed both groups on treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, was noted that Altargo was used in the treatment of abszessen (eitful cavities in the body tissue) or of infections, which have been proven to be proven by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo were overthrown during the short treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, sculsions, or wires wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd., a permit for the inception of Altargo in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients with which no improvements occurred within two to three days should be examined once again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensibility or serious local irritation by the use of retapamulin Saline, the treatment is aborted to uncover the ointment and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or assumed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">Clinical trials in clinical studies of secondary wounds caused the effectiveness of retapamulin for patients with infections, which were caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered in consideration if after a 2- or 3-day treatment does not enter a improvement or a worsening of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical products on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentration, which have been achieved when humans have been achieved using topical skin or infected surfaces, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 In concurrent injection of 2 times a day, 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the average retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax to topical application of 1% retapamulin for a reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure of topical treatment in patients, dosing adjustments may not be required if topical retapamulin will be applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction elasticity after oral ingestion and are insufficient in terms of a statement regarding the birth and the federal financial / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is preferable to the gift of an ic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding, the breastfeeding continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo is to be continued / terminated is considering the benefit of the nursing infant for the infant and benefit of the agtargo therapy for woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo had been applied, the most commonly reported adverse events was about 1% of patients concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleukutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus (formerly Pleurotus passeckanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of the retapamulin is based on the selective inhibitor of the bacterial protein synthesis in the 50s subunit of the bacterial chromosome that differs from the binding of other ribosomal interacts antibacterial infections.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the Treaties of ribosom protein L3 are involved and associated with the ribosom P-binding agency and the Peptidyltransferingen center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding agent Pleukutiline block the peptidylbenzene, block partially P-binding interactions and prevent the normal development of active 50s ribosom subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance the use of retapamulin in at least some infections of infection should appear to be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of retapamulin to S.aureus, regardless of whether the insulator were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure on treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine and Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption in a study with healthy adults was applied 1% retapamulin Saline daily under Okclusion up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retapamulin Saline twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatical wounds, single plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling procedure was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients in front of Mediation and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum personic absorption per person was given to the topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of peeled skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The Metabolism in vitro was characterized by retapamulin in human liver microsomes primarily with CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats at in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">Neither in male nor female rats were neither male nor female rats with oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has been achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest quality of the human being (topical application on 200 cm2 of lypted skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were determined with oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times of the estimated body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The file controller must ensure that a pharmacovilage system is to ensure that a pharmacovilage system is present in the 1.8.1 of the application form (version 6.2) and will work before the product is being marketed as long as the market is being marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the consent of the Inhallway is obliged to undertake detailed analysis and additional pharmacovilations to be described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the 1.8.2 of the approval application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for" products for human use ", the updated RMP should be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or any other signs and symptoms of the treated place, you should end the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions in the area that will be treated with Altargo unless expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be applied in eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is seen from one of these areas, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if disputes occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the Saline you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gazing band, unless your doctor has advised you to cover the area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases which affect the liver) in children between the ages of 15 and 15, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of one of two doses existing vaccination, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">This reason, Ambirix is only allowed to be used when during immunisation, a low risk of hepatitis B infection is provided and ensured that the vaccine plan can be brought to an end from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Whenever a rushing dose is undesired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix can also be given an other hepatitis B or B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act as they can teach the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "how it can defend against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and the surface antigens of "alien" and antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the accine accine of Twinrix Kinder since 1996 and the accine of Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Twinrix adults and Twinrix are used, however, to treat the three vaccines to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults are administered in one out of three doses of existing vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix are identical ingredients, some of the data that support the use of Twinrix adults are also used as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicative for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated kids, which had been developed a month after the last injection of antibody-concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month interval between both injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">At between 98 and 100% of vaccinated kids, Ambirix was a month after the last injection of the antibody drug against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of the Protection of Ambirix was similar at a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturity (tiredness) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix is able to respond to patients that are possibly allergic to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. a permit for the ownership of the company concerned by the Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization board with Ambirix consists of two vaccination boxes with the first dose to be given at the appointment of the election and the second dose ranges from six to twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a rinsing vaccination is requested for hepatitis B as well as for hepatitis B, vaccinated may be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalous vaccines or with a combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis virus and anti-hepatitis virus (anti-HBsAg) anti-hepatitis virus (anti-HAV) antigen levels are in the same size as after vaccination with the relevant monovalants vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured if immunwledgeable persons who have been awarded to a Hepatitis A- vaccination, because they may not be protected as protection, because it may well be protected from immunological antibodies by the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection components, for the rare case of anaphylactic response, such opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring may always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is needed, the standardization scheme is recommended to combine 360 ELISA units formless inactive hepatitis C virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of haemulation patients and persons with malfunctions of the immune system, it is possible to have sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibody worth, so in these cases the gift of other vaccination may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal importer, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of throbocytopenia or hemorinterferences, Ambirix can also injected, as it can occur in these cases to intramuscular administration to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the second year of life with a combined diphthie-, tetanus-, azellophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / HIB) or with a combined massima mumps, the immune response was adequate for all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosusive therapy or for patients with immune defects, no sufficient immune response must be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study that was conducted with 3 vaccine doses of these formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, pain, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever is comparable with the frequency which was observed in the previous thiomeric and preservative-containing vaccination formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines Ambirix were given to a total of 1027 vaccinations at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 and up to 15 years the compatibility of Ambirix was compared to the 3-doses-combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturities at a calculated base per vaccine, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix with 50.7% of subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses-combination.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the entire vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the subjects agreed to the Ambirix were over pain, compared with 63.8% for the subjects which were vaccinated with the 3-dose combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Matter was comparable per proband (i.e. across the entire vaccinations at 39,6% of subjects, the Ambirix was compared with 36.2% for the subjects which received the 3-doses-combination.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of pain and maturities was low and comparable to that, which was observed after administration of combining the combination of 3 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year vaccines the occurrence of local reactions and general reaction in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to the hepatitis C virus and 10 µg of recombined hepatitis B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, in the 6- to 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, however, was reported a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that have severe side effects during the 2-cans octagas with Ambirix or during the 3-cans octopas with combined hepatitis C virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B-B- surface antigen, was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were performed in vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the serum rates for anti-HAV 99,1% were a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for the month of 6 given dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-hbs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for the month of 6 given dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year olds, 142 two doses Toxrix and 147 received the standard combined fabric with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">At the 289 persons whose immunity was excreable, the serum rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose-vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which was reached in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old one month after the completion of the full vaccine series (i.e. in the month of 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-doses of inoculations with Ambirix or 3-cans oculations with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis B-B and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B-Surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">Persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years old were able to prove the consistency of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies over at least 24 months after the immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response to both antigens observed in this study was comparable to vaccination of 3 doses, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B and 10 µg of recombined hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies were compared 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccinations.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was administered at the same time with the indemnification of a combined diphthie-, tetanus-, acellophilus influenza vaccination, inactivated Poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccination, was the immune response to all antigens adequate.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults was demonstrated to present formulation similar to serum samples and serokonsion rates as for former formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the reset level on any foreign particles and / or physical changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, an pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines Ambirix can not fully protect from an infection with hepatitis virus or hepatitis B virus, even if the full vaccine series was completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are infected with hepatitis virus or hepatitis B virus in the administration of both vaccines (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel) a vaccine may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that harm the liver or symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• When your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix, or any part of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can result in itching skin rash, asthma or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have occurred in your child an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child have a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly create a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and in the conventionally agreed agreement of the second vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2785">If a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead he recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis C / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components (360 ELISA units of a formal inactive hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination of this vaccine with low levels of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination before ending the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is sprayed on people who are in the muscle and not injected into the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to a disease or treatment in your / her body's defense, or if you / your child fold in a tick.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons on the vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / she / her child receive further medicines (including those who have been vaccinated without prescribing) or if you / your child have been vaccinated / has been given or immunoglobulins (antibodies) or has been planned or that in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine is at the same time has to be treated with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as possible limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">When Ambirix was given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix can not be administered during pregnancy or lactating women, except for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information on certain other parts of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (anti-antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on data, which has become known for the first approval of the first permit for the inception, CHMP noted the benefit of the benefits of the Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix, however, is only limited in one member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited because of the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammoniakage concentrations) in the prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is served - devided to several single doses to the meals alone, mixed by the food or via a Gastrostomieset (by the abdominal wall in the stomach) or a Nasenonde (induced by the nose in the stomach).</seg>

<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also result in appetite loss, an abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, nausea, vomiting, nausea, blockage, skin rash, skin rash or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that ammonium in patients with disorders of the urea cycle is effectively avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonium has been approved under "extraordinary circumstances" as a result of the approval of the disease at the time of approval, limited information about this drug.</seg>
<seg id="2813">It is indexed in all patients with a complete enumage of enzyme already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifested form (incomplete enzyme defective, which manifests itself after the first life month) there is an indication for the use when in the history of the history of genealogical Encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, not able to swallow up tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account of protein tolerance and the needed daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium methyl butyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg and for adolescent and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early manifest deficiency of carbylphosphatsynthetic or Ornithintrance bamylase, substitution of citruline or arginine is required at a time of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatsynthetic vitamin deficiency have to receive arginine in an dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is risk for the birth of estophagushera if the tablets does not reach the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2,5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g of sodium methyl butyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be applied to patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and oil deformation, only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because Metabolism and excretion of sodium methylene glyphate has been taken over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied with extreme caution on patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The meaning of these results in respect to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In a subcutaneous gift of phenylacetat of young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), it became a slowdown of neuronal tasting and to a increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delusion of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found whether phenylacetat is excreted by humans into the mother's milk, and for that reason the use of AMMONAPS during the lactation is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least 56% of patients have at least one undesirable event (AU) and at 78% of these adverse events was assumed that they were not connected to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year-old anoretic female patient who has been using a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactacid, severe hypokalemia, armoravian, peripheral Neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The case of an overdose stood at a 5-month old infant with a accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go on an accumulation of phenylacetat, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in a intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetat is a metabolized active connection, which is conjugated by acetyl to phenylamine glutamine which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Kerosacetylglutamine with urea is comparable (both compounds containing 2 nitric oxide); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suited as an alternative carrier for the determination of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with malfunctions of the urea cycle can be assumed that every gram of methylene glycemyrate can be used between 0.12 and 0.15 g Phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms of newborns was earlier almost ever faust and the disease himself led to death with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids, in the first year of life to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to haemalysis, the use of alternative means of nitrogen excretion (sodium zoyl butyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium discharge of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns at postpartally (but within the first life-month) to increase diagnostic diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were treated before the first occurrence of a hyper encephalopathy was demonstrated, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was diagnosed with many intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficit.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifested form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozyginal form of the Ornithintrance bamylase deficiency) which were treated by a hyperopic encephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium methylbutyrate and a proteinated diet was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are already very reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylalyrate is oxidised to phenylacetat, which is conjugated in liver and kidney disease with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its Metabolites in plasma and urine have been determined after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate for patients with disorders of the urea-cycle, haemulation and repeated gifts of oral dosages of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also studied for cancer patients with an intravenous administration of Nazibutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetat.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylalyal in tablet form, 15 minutes after ingestion plasma concentration of phenylbutyrate have been established.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea disorders, or hemogloopopathies, in different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning no Phenylacetat in plasma was detectable.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeated using Sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher compared to the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product Phenylacetylglutamine by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus test, sodium methylene glyphate had no toxic effects of toxic effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken orally taken (infants and children who still don't swallow any tablets or patients with canopy) or a Gastrostomiard or a Nasenonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium methyl butyrate is: 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg and for adolescent and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine, serum samples in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early manifest deficiency of carbylphosphatsynthetic or Ornithintrance bamylase, substitution of citruline or arginine is required at a time of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium methyl butyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium methyl butyrate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat droutes were exposed to phenylacetat (active metabolit, phenylbutyrat), there came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year-old anoretic female patient who has been using a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactacid, severe hypokalemia, armoravian, peripheral Neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine with urea is comparable (both compounds containing 2 nitric atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suited as an alternative carrier for the discharge of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of examinations on phenylacetylglutamine in patients with malfunctions of the urea-cycle can be assumed that every gram of methylene glycemyrate can be used between 0,12 and 0.15 g Phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are already very reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylalyal in granulatform, 15 minutes after ingestion plasma concentration of phenylbutyrate have been established.</seg>

<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g Sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must receive the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium methyl butyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare illnesses, certain liver enzymes are absent, so that they can accumulate the nitrogen-containing products that are consumed by the intake of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">When you check laboratory tests, you must inform the physician that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium discharge the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with "acute coronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood sugar (a form of pain in the chest, with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) or myocardial infarction (an anomal measuring value of electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients receiving a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with Angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox is used in allsome administration or in connection with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIA inhibitor (GPI, another anti-anticoagulans) and a GPI compared to a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was used to treat the patient a stent (a short tube in the arteries to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, like Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year, as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent one PCI, angiox was as effective in all indicators as effective as Heparin, except for heavy bleeding in which it was more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other stags or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Moreover, it may not be applied in patients who recently had a hemorrhage, as well as with people with strong blood pressure or serious kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that angiox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve approval of the agency of Angiox throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndromes (instabile Angina / Non- ST / NSTEMI) in an emergency raid or if an early intervention is envisaged.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous combination of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in another row a PCI should be given an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg and infusion for the duration of the surgery at 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After clinical results, the reduced infusion dosage can be recovered from 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours after clinical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the input.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of a initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of which immediately followed intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Security and effectiveness of a single Bolus-gift from angiox is not been studied and is not recommended, even if a short PCI surgery is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT is shortened after 5 minutes) to under 225 seconds, a second bolt should be 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and administered intravenously using the application dose.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT score is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min) that is treated with a PCI (whether Bivalirudin vs ACS or not), a lower incinerrate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT score is below 225 seconds, a second one is given by 0.3 mg / kg, and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt brake again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which led to approval of III- PCI study (Replace-2), the ACT score was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudin-Bolus with no dose adjustment on average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox may be initiated 30 minutes after the completion of the administered intravenous unquestioned Heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous gift of low-molecular Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• High sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against herdsmiine • active hemorrhage or higher risk of blood due to a fault of the hemostatic system and / or irreversible bacterial infections. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulation (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though in patients with bivalirudine, most blood cells in the arterial spot points can occur in patients that occur in a perkutant coronary intervention (PCI), during the treatment as well as bleeding everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are treated warfarin and treated with bivalirudine, a monitoring of INR value (International normalised Ratio) should be considerate to ensure that the value after radiation treatment is achieved before the treatment existing at Bivalirudine.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge about the mechanism of antibodies (Heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocytes aggregationshemmer) can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalirudin with throbocytes aggregates or antibodies, the clinical and biological hemostatic parameters in any case can be monitored regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Experimental examinations are due to impact on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, insufficient or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudine plus GPIB / IIIA Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either infractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIB / IIIA Inhibitor.</seg>

<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding as defined in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both lightweight and severe bleeding happened at Bivalirudin alone than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIB / IIIA Inhibitor plus GPIB / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding within the point of the point, reducing hemoglobinds of ≥ 3 g / dl with unknown blood station, reoperation based on bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood localization, which occurred in more than 0.1% (sometimes), were "other" point points, retroperitoneal, gastrophoneal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical study involving Bivalirudin in 6000 patients who underwent a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalirudin group as well as in the patients treated with Heparin, it was more common in women and in patients over 65 years more common than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">In both light and severe bleeding problems occurred lower than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIB / IIIA Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects that are not listed above have been reported in practice after comprehensive application and are classified according to system organclasses in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose the treatment with bivalirudine is disrupted immediately and the patient becomes concise in relation to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombinor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and the annion bindings of thrombin, irrespective of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or of the agulsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond by Bivalirudin to thrombin, and therewith its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin has evaporated slowly the bond of bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 so that the function of active centre is regenerated by Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudin serum-induced Thrombozytopenia / heparinsurgically-induced Thrombosis Syndrome (HIT / HITTS) was unable to induce thrombocytes aggregation.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients Bivalirudin shows a dose of dosing and concentration dependent on the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR, and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In case a PCI was carried out in the following cases, an additional bolt should be increased by 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudine and infusion for the duration of the surgery on 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes, which require a treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected in the abdominal wall, the upper thighs or the upper arm, or infusion as continuous fusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin to regulate the glucose level or the insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-insulin differs very slightly from Humanité, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter form of action has as a short-effective humanist.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-effective insulin-type 1 diabetes in which the body can not produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body insulin can not operate effectively, Apidra was enrolled in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicative for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosmoped hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, in six months a reduction of 0.14% (of 7,60% to 7.46%) was observed in comparison to a reduction of 0.14% with insulin-per-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra as compared to 0.30% in human normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra can not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive to insulin or any of the other components, or patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may have to be adjusted, if combined with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Commissioner Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to take approval from Apidra to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is to be used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, thighs or wildecontamination by continuous infusion in the area of abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose levels and the reduced insulin delivery, the insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Each change in force (s), the type of insulin (normal, NPH, zinc delaying, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin delivery) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment, especially in patients with an insulant diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic Ketoazide; these states are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The switch of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin should be under strict medical supervision and may be required to change the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycemia depends on the insulin profile of the insulin dose and can therefore change with changeover of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances which increase the blood sugar sensory activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycopics, include oral antidiabetics, angiotoxetine, oxetoxetine, monooxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates, and sulfa drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition under the effect of sympathizolines such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and Reserva the symptoms of adrenaline circulation are weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on refractive elasticity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humanitarian in relation to the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin injections occurs in human breast milk but generally, insulin is not absorbed in the breast milk, nor is it resordered after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are the symptoms of clinical trials which are identified in clinical trials, grouped according to system organclasses and in order following the severity of her appearance (very common: ≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000; rare).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, fear, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, loss of loss, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophie is missed, to change the injection point inside the injection unit continuously, it may occur following a Lipodystrophie at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglycops with a vielessness can be given by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given to a doctor by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucoagonal injection the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the judging item for the heavy pituoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose levels (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous gauze results are quicker and the effect is shorter than near hu- manem.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50, with type 1 diabetes, the insulin-relevant metering range of 0.075 to 0,15 E / kg demonstrated a proportional rise in the dose-glucose tolerance effect, and with 0.3 e / kg or more, a proportional rise in the glucose tolerance effect.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-insulin has a double effectiveness occurring like normal human rights and achieves the complete glucose tolerance effect for about 2 hours earlier than humanity.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Data from the data was visibly given that a similar postpranciary glycaemic control was reached in 2 minutes before the meal, as with human normal insulin, which is 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Was geared in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpranial control was given a better postpranial control that was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned to 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a similar glycemic control is achieved as for human normal currents (see Figure 1) in front of the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin for 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the beginning of the meal, which was given in a comparison to humankind standard, the last 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the beginning of the meal was given (Figure 1A) as well as a meal in front of a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after the beginning of the meal) after the beginning of the meal, after the beginning of the meal, which was 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) was given before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
