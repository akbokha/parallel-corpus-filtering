this is a list of standard modules from the k@@ de package ; add @-@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
if you install k@@ de@@ base , you should install the k@@ de@@ base package before comp@@ ile this package .
in order to use the crash module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to the ex@@ quer@@ or ; then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crash@@ es if available .
the Spec@@ ific filter ( also called folder filter ) is available in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar with ex@@ tras . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory aimed at different types of filters .
to view the DO@@ M tree in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can select Extras DO@@ M tree . as pres@@ et@@ ting the ad begins with the root mark of the document , example : document@@ an , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root of roots .
the Module &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; offers a further view for objects with the M@@ IME @-@ type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ bar and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the pec@@ uli@@ arity of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists of a @-@ called folder hierarchy with the help of a so @-@ called tree @-@ map . each object is proportional to its size . the size must be proportional to its size . the size must have the size of equal objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder where the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries within . accordingly , it can be easily detected as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you can be considered .
in &amp; fs@@ view , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display provides a rectangle , which represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have reasonable color and labelling settings .
the colour of a rectangle , which is switched over the view color mode , can either be depth for the slight detection of the waste depth or the picture of another file size as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can specify if sufficient space is present or if the area is displayed by limitations during the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . in addition , you can define the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rectangle below .
with the creation algorithm for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule is proportional to the size of the entry . at the tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this goal will not always be kept . note that less space for the frame is lost when the rectangle is square .
as an indication of the area of a single entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation will be provided so that there are always beneficial the surfaces that are square . the best methods of this respect are lines , columns or rec@@ al@@ sive second .
you can set the minim@@ ally described area for an entry on the menu entry pin . instead , a pre@@ ten@@ ant pattern is drawn in the area of the parent entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .
it was originally intended as a little test application and introduced to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map @-@ Wid@@ gets , which was developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ rin@@ d .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera body will be provided to you to connect with your digital camera and then supports your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ous ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and any card reader , which is supported by your OS , work with &amp; digi@@ ous ; working together .
&amp; digi@@ der , contains a quick image processing with basic training tools . you can use these to evaluate and correct your photos . evaluate and evaluate the work capabilities can easily be expanded with the K@@ DE image plug@@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
though &amp; digi@@ ous , easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G export and ICC @-@ color administ@@ er workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over camera or lens , can be searched using .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end user . therefore , you should contact problems and improvement options .
&amp; digi@@ der , the det@@ ach@@ ment of any problems or improvement to make it easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the fault report . all necessary information will be registered here . follow only the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ ous , is a project supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developer may help each other . if you are invited to answer a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ous , and hopefully soon we will ask you another user questions . in this mailing list it will be English , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also see the digi@@ plug ; homepage visit , news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ came ; to learn .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ ous ; registration in the developer mailing list . guidance for regist@@ ering in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ ous ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ der , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folders . simply enter the folder icon or click the Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your machine . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add a lot of folders like you like . &amp; digi@@ der , you will also use an aluminum library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , which contains images as the base folder . no picture will be changed as an album . no picture will be changed . during the search of the folder you get a progress indicator show like this :
&amp; digi@@ ous , thir@@ st for the libr@@ arian in all its depth . you cannot fill any sub@@ folder , unless it is in a hidden folder , so you can insert an item &amp; digi@@ plug ; set a point in front of the folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ der are not taking photos as symbols . you can modify the albums by using any photos and this will be used as an album symbol . further details can be found in section albums .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Al@@ bums and My Computer button to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ Hel@@ ung .
how to set up and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera body will be provided to you to connect with your digital camera and then supports your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ous ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and any card reader , which is supported by your OS , work with &amp; digi@@ ous ; working together .
modern digital cameras are based on the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards , USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for the actual transfer . the camera will then be implemented as a disk drive . the camera can also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ist , the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 is used for communic@@ ating digital cameras , which has an ever increasing number of digital cameras , a widely used protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ is@@ sions over the serial port , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ plug , this link supports the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that EX@@ IF support is necessary to read the thumb@@ nails . if EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may be unable to do any thumb@@ nails or creating it may be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ ous , how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug@@ ins interface project ( Hand@@ book ) is a basic module for &amp; digi@@ ous ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide the modules for all video programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manip@@ ulate images in virtually any way as it is also a user . your advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ came ; by writing a small module to complement a function when changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; self @-@ performed .
to simplify the windows , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; switch or switch to full screen mode using F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
removing and removing pictures works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the al@@ ben@@ bau@@ d , via the horizontal divi@@ ding line or in another application window . the only limitation is that one picture is not in keywords , data list or searching .
- a file selection allows you to get the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields which are displayed in the symbol view . so the fil@@ tering is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind the symbol view is displayed . which fields can be displayed in the nam@@ ing dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ke@@ .it ; provides a organized view of your photo albums under the name of their collection , in which they are stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ chmarks or after the date when the album was created first , the album can be modified in the properties of the album .
if you have setup a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select an album import@@ ing photos directly to an album . select an album import@@ ing screenshot .
to copy or move an image from an album to another album , you can choose the photo with the mouse on the target album . you can also move or copy the picture by moving or copy . simply select all photos and move it to the target album .
one album includes a collection of photos and album features allow you to add information on this collection . to click on the album , click with the right button of the mouse and select the album features .
Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums in order that you can select them under a common name . select the collection from the tool bar or select &quot; View Al@@ bums &quot; from the collection . when you are adding new collections , you can do so in the collections for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : used when you sort your albums by Date with View Al@@ bums tab . sort by date .
the older r@@ ger , average , recent : these set the date on the one of the oldest , the newest image or the average of the album . this first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF data . if this fails , the date of the last change in this folder will be used instead .
when you first came up in &amp; digi@@ ous ; the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ke@@ .it ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you want to choose another photo as a symbol .
to select a different photo as an album icon , click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; In addition , you can choose the photo to the album in the list below to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in the collection and collections can &apos;t be ve@@ iled .
&amp; digi@@ ous , supported by keywords for individual photos in the area My key@@ note list on the left in the main window . album collections have all the photos of the album . they can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos .
the screen window gives you the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the screen window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can customize the size of this thumb@@ nail in the tool@@ bar .
if you &apos;re opening an album first time , you must wait briefly while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this you can avoid any thumb@@ nails in the menu Extras .
information on each picture will be displayed below the proper pre@@ viewing . here you can set up the settings dialog . select the Al@@ bums tab and customize the section thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails feature support window , which appear , when you leave the cursor at a moment on a picture . the screenshot above shows the key features including all keywords of an photos . the screen photo above shows the main window at the top in the main window .
photos are all that comes with &amp; digi@@ ous ; dies . albums and tags allow you to organize your photos and make you a number of improvements to this . you can choose the preview menu or the menu image in the menu bar . you have the choice between the look and the images , a slideshow or the editing of images .
you can open the image processing with a photo , using either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button and edit ... Select a guide to edit your photos . with the image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it can occur that &amp; digi@@ der ; the functionality you need , not available . you can open a photo in a different program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button , and how you will adapt the program from the sub@@ menu if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should consider that after processing other image processing programs may cause problems with the metadata in the image . some programs do not store data with the data contained in the image . this information does not save data from the EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , Bl@@ end , etc .
&amp; digi@@ plug , two possibilities are available for rotation . the easiest way to click and select for the right mouse button . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a picture , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ ti@@ f , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you can delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ ous , it will be postpon@@ ed to the tr@@ ash@@ can of &amp; k@@ de ; F8 picture del@@ etion or ent@@ f if you prefer to really delete , you can use it by using Shift ; ent@@ f .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ppers ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ p@@ tor , either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date picture below , so that only the pictures of the selected days will be shown .
photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and cat@@ alog@@ ical . tags are st@@ ic@@ kers , which can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword is assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword will appear .
tags can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . by clicking here you can find your keywords log@@ ically . you can also summar@@ ize parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword or quot ; you can find the keywords that you are looking for .
the key words are stored in a database for quick access and easy access to the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your key words in other programs . in addition , the tags are imported by losing the database , once &amp; digi@@ der , the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or add a new keyword if you clicked on a new keyword , this keyword will be added to this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and delete the keyword , the photo itself will not delete . just the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a sample by drag it to the desired position in the tree and then appear there . then , a menu that gives you the keyword to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword in clicking it with the right mouse button and in the context menu keyword . you can change the name and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ;
to select a different photo as an album icon , click the picture with the right button of the mouse and select it in the context menu as Alb@@ um@@ preview . in addition , you can put the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to use &amp; digi@@ ous ; s functionality using keyword means , you must first choose your photos with keyword ; once you click on the respective keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; you can also click on the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nails and select from the context menu keyword .
you can choose a photo with any number of words . the photo is displayed as soon as you can select one of the keywords associated with him . on this way , you can arrange one keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event , where it was made , etc .

you can also remove a keyword in which you can open the photos with the right mouse button of the menu and select from the tags menu . the menu shows you only the keywords that were assigned to the photograph .
the time jet display shows an adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a drop @-@ down can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . just click on the lower box of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . thereby , all the related pictures will appear in the main window .
in the field below you can input a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keyword , albums , collections , dat@@ est@@ amps and in the future more .
Neb@@ uch@@ ie Search box is a small bulb the green light if the search takes place . if you click here the fil@@ tering is deleted and all images will be displayed . then the lamp turns red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars under the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you can open this search here as the search crit@@ er@@ ion , you can always specify that which you have entered as the search crit@@ er@@ ion . after you saved the released filter in the list .

the Advanced search provides you an extended search form with many search parameters available with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set out the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ Bank . one option can add or delete all rules . any option can be added with others above the logical operations everyone ... , One ... , no ... or minimum ... Qu@@ ite you can create .
&amp; digi@@ ous , characterized by a long number with a special technology , the hair algorithm . this enables to compare pictures by compar@@ ing these signatures . depending on the difference between two no@@ bles , the more they match . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can let each picture fall in order to find a similar item . by using a s@@ al@@ erts , the result list can be enlarged or smaller . if you can open a picture of nowhere on the left side bar , then this will open and you can drop it there .
sk@@ etch : free hand color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and digi@@ plug ; find the right pictures , too . a swelling value can also be set here .
this rider introduces an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ atures . you can put it with the mouse wheel in or out or move it . put it in the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed . of course , this assumes that your pictures are contained in Ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folders .
&amp; digi@@ plug , presents a light in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L The light is added to the window menu . the selection is added to the window . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ous window , you can quickly open the light with L Extras .
from the preview pane , you can compare the pictures you want to compare , in the left or right pane of the window . if you can preview them out of the tool bar and operate storage operations on one of the images , then they will compare the same section of both images .
another mode is better suited to import quickly from a series of images . if you navigate from the tool bar , then the left mouse button will appear in the left side . this is easier to display on the left side . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar images .
of course , normal del@@ sch@@ reactions are also working directly from the ligh@@ test as e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it possible for example to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each unit you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ v@@ elling function you need to navigate to the cross@@ wise arrows . in order to hold the visible area of the picture , you must click on it and the L@@ MB ; in the mode preview the same image will show the same image area .
the zoom works just as in other views . simply use the zoom knob among the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both images if you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital matter management - off the bu@@ zz@@ word ? digital stock management considered every part of the process , after the picture has been taken up to the final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos stores , sc@@ oring or digital photos stores this form but not in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to backup , find , protect and use photos . we will focus on the procedures for digital photograph@@ ers the &amp; digi@@ plug ; we will consider downloading , ren@@ ame , optimize , maintain , maintain , and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xed , categor@@ ized , trans@@ forms , transform , conf@@ ected and exported contents to a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata are defined as data relating to data . metadata are provided according to your definition data that will provide information about or documentation other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you don &apos;t need more than 1000 photos on your computer . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to use the metadata in a database as well as in the image files . you can access it freely with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you want to fit any thing in your system . your image files must somehow take place on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved disk or if you need to change them to a reserved drive or if you need to change them to a bigger drive .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . for you , you can easily organize your memory location . if you have enough photos , then you will print sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a web page .
professional photograph@@ ers have other demands such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archiving , working processes , constant delivery of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will and you will not re @-@ organize your structure for that content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing simpler . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the metadata store in the format of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ plug ; this ensures that EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data can be stored into the file . if you remember , then you can select the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Edit menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change them ? this includes a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now start the real work , since you need to select each photo words , lab@@ eling and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that you can use the same attribute . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos .
now let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords , how you can proceed in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import a catalog from another source with embedded keywords , then apply the tree to the correct place . the change of the Hier@@ archy inside the tree is no problem and can be easily done by pulling a sub@@ tree on another . the modified box is being done by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while the sub@@ tree is pursued .
the graphic shows how different metadata is out@@ crop . this is a very rough representation , since each block consists of metadata in truth in many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keyword - the next section refers to lab@@ eling or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ise your metadata .
most people want to simply let your photos look simply , you want to share it with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . you are certainly interested in your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer to it , you &apos;ll catch some details to see it , the place .
and now I tell you this of the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing , you may even hear the silence , you might even hear the silence . the writing has changed your perception of this panorama .
for others consider the title is perhaps more important than the image itself to create a story . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to help him understand about the motive that you are moving about what you understand .
it &apos;s ok if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for themselves alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ous , you can save as much text in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , and you can even export a spell chec@@ ker . if you can even export your pictures to the label and / or the title of the web Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems if you don &apos;t have to tell you a second time for the recording and / or the title of the web gallery .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find yourself in another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train de@@ parts the spatial presentation now with light speed .
the possibilities of co @-@ use are already inn@@ um@@ erable and become deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your travels to Google Earth . you can also export the pictures in Google Earth . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc . by using Google Earth maps .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word play with Copyright and den@@ otes the practice the copyright to remove the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , thus also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographer , e.g. , in order to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organisation could not be changed . this field does not support Com@@ ma nor Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel ( syn@@ onym for author ) : links with the author . this field contains the job title of the photographer . examples of this can be as a freelance photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify which means a photo agency like Reuters or Associated Press , then these organizations might be listed here . if the photograph shows a picture , then the group / agency will be shown here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not have any protection against abuse . any one who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ ous , such a module will provide such a module for stap@@ le processing in the near future .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same they can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negative . in this section , these are problems with the so @-@ called new media .
bank@@ roll , the greatest data recovery firm in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a potential data loss .
to be able to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs which need to be kept more careful and one may not trust you more than a couple of years . of course there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 that piece that can claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it is in your modeling room .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable but you can use this risk in which you can use good disp@@ ks and good recording devices and keep them in the correct way , but they are much more expensive than the cheapest , but they are much reliable to choose .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able to mistakes , even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . because of this massive protection it is needed by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to do wonders for CDs and DVDs . it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that read damaged data from damaged flo@@ pp@@ ies , hard drives , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format of the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store up to 50 GB and thus , almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ Player DVD with 8,5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
slowly burn your data with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a not ex@@ propri@@ ate format . if you want to copy the media with a clean , dark dry and prior to animals protected site . please do not forget to print the data to the next generation of media or software that can read out the media .
disk@@ producers retain their statistics for themselves . your manufacturer factors include a new disk but not the data . Google sets a big field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives : disk error
in brief : dis@@ cos keep the longest when you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . these errors are the most common error cause , SM@@ ART can not determine this error . some of SM@@ ART reported error messages . these are particularly readers and publishing count . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only about the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a black@@ out before you secured the files , but these losses usually leave without any major problems .
while most electrical devices don &apos;t make much of those devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed profiles , these can take heavy damage . on your computer you can use these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , broken mother@@ boards and other defects . so , protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against currents is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs energy and the rest . it is usually ob@@ tain@@ able in the form of a plug @-@ in . however , remember that each plug @-@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ load protection , then you should take care of the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this ensures a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care of protecting the protection against lightning bolt and protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should also ensure that all peri@@ pher@@ als are connected to your system . some manufacturers provide an over@@ voltage for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modems and the TV .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore you also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a failure of only few seconds can result in the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it may therefore be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection against over@@ tension , these tools can automatically increase the battery power if a power out@@ age occurs . some models allow them to save them up to the stream . if you have a US@@ V then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
remember the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare it with costs for avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 euro . this is just a small price difference if you remember to keep your computer with it . at the end , you should always remember all cables to tr@@ enne before you get into the holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration you can connect this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; Mac , and Windows . this allows you to save this as a backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer that you can save any amounts of data .
they are very expensive in comparison to the hard drives at home but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data over a relatively slow internet .
solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is no general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online memory services that are stored on photos . their free memory is limited to 1@@ GB . the professional version provides you more at your disposal , in case of Flickr . for $ 25 a year you &apos;ll get unlimited memory , which should not be verified in reality .
in view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocols and the big companies are included in the offer of backup and f@@ itter memory . thus , they are deser@@ ving .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission sequence on the machine . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transfer errors . the fil@@ esystem support and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk safe .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . no one appears to be in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocols is much more secure data away than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transfers , because they generate inter@@ ferences within the data stream . with normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transfers , you should look into the future . before 2010 you &apos;ll see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates in order to handle and highly scalable : it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . this article is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and now , please read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate that ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the notebook and 46 % for the job systems . on not@@ ebooks already the proportion of rob@@ ber@@ y is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most . it leads to lower harm than such as theft or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; there was already no longer sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal even better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to the common file systems . find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : incorrect , only the rate of trial period during an operation is higher and a un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not completely saved before the problem came up , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : incorrect , theft and human error are the major causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are removed 1 @-@ 2 bl@@ inding settings from fundamental physical limits . the fact that during the technology , there is a natural limit for that progress . sensitivity and scope characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from that limit .
today &apos;s cameras enter the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deteri@@ or@@ ated for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive will be responsible today for 100 &amp; euro . so do not make anyone affected by any data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a data loss during each year and test this backup before you do anything out as the re@@ install of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash drives you happiness when the drive in the moment was not connected .
a disaster hits local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are safe enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention is not a local storage . bring your back@@ ups up to the stair@@ way , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as already mentioned above is a common cause of data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two points : the complete backup and the last difference backup .
in@@ incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can produce the original status at any time again . this f@@ use comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system the next one with the exception it is only ab@@ sent@@ ed and not going on .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily move to your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync just copied the difference of files that really changed . this happens and if you want to increase the security of ssh .
secure important images directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another visual medium .
this approach will allow you enough time to detect and recover losses . at the same time , you come up for the backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot of each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .

so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that is about the time span in which you really are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
because the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , you have to consider with caution and assess the time . unfortunately , there are no other possibility to be in@@ compatible as the current system . however , less versions you have used in the past , the easier is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by using the explanations in this document . use / switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
Virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that &apos;s important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and f@@ use technology or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means always increasing .
let &apos;s go that you have planning the scal@@ ability with it and put up the area you want on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it onto a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new plate was detected by the system , but they don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC # source , the new record / dev / S@@ DC &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ s ; # will change with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; residence permit / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of navigation FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create these yourself . this task is easier by year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that appears slowly from the market . you should therefore not use it any more .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard , but it can save a lot more . it is fun @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit , and full transparency . P@@ NG can be used as many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF , and this format will we recommend you to store your images .
TIFF was widely used as a picture format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed format or in a container with a loss@@ less compression sal@@ m . a problem is however , however , that this format has been adjusted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital neg@@ atives file format is a licensed and open image format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is now based on TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata . a hand@@ ful camera maker is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe introduced XML based X@@ MP technology ; it is a mix of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is available with the extension &amp; quot ; the file information is stored in the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers prefer to record a original of your recording , mostly seen in the raw format , as it saves the metadata in separately from the image file . however , you can think about the link between the metadata stream and the image file . therefore , you should think if you are using DN@@ G as a container and place everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that supports a great range of application and business models . among the activities of D@@ C@@ MI , the work on the D@@ C@@ MI work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ful efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera , you can use this as temporary f@@ use .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them to your repository . this function is not implemented yet .
you can use external programs for a layer of layer . when you return the images with &amp; digi@@ ous , then you should add the metadata again . these were then cut by other programs .
protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them in MPEG , you can use in MPEG , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ous ; add a description how you already have to add photos that you already have on your hard disk . but the camera interface lets you give you many advanced settings to import@@ ing images to your night@@ mare bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in your camera manual .
when you start the camera interface , it &apos;s trying to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ tile indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are shown . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame and a symbol for file access will appear for each file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to view the camera information to each entry . with the side@@ bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras , no information will be available .
the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer re@@ mark , GPS etc of the image . these information are the same as if the metadata side bar comes from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ous ; or the image processing . please note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all photos . this will download all photos from their camera into one single album in &amp; digi@@ ous ; . during download the photos are not deleted , and we recommend to check if you delete pictures from your camera .
if you do not want to download all photos you want to download the desired choice of default options by &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then select the selected one as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . these pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ous ; for example , the new pictures have been downloaded by a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you choose the buttons All download or download the chosen albums , a dialog with which you can select the target album is displayed in which the photos are sorted , see in section My Al@@ bums tab . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; download photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all of them . if you only want to delete a few , you must first select it and delete the selected file .
please note that there is no way to recover the photos you &apos;ve deleted from the camera . if you are not deleted from the camera . if you want to remove it completely from the camera . if you want to remove it from camera , you should make it more faster than the camera name , since it is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos frequently not meaningful name . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally utilized once again . this can be used to double file names , in case you have photos of different recording scenes in the same album . therefore , it may be reasonable , the date and time when the image was taken into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors the image and for data bases . if you are using this last option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options during the transmission opens three additional options that are done before the photos will be stored on the plate via the author in the standard tab . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the EX@@ IF data into the IP@@ TC @-@ fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . then switch on the date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you are using the option for camera fil@@ en@@ ames , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case if you prefer .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ plug , is displayed below the name , which will display the camera in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be stored and automatically used when you start the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ der , it is possible to use all information about the camera for the time point of recording , in order to perform an automatic rotation during the shut@@ down . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section side@@ bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t supply these information , leaves &amp; digi@@ der ; the photo in the original orientation or when you turn the automatic turn off and select the automatic rotation in the lower window of the window .
when your camera provides information on the date , at which the photo was made , can use &amp; digi@@ ous ; this sub@@ ver@@ bs are based on the image data . all images with the same date are available in the same sub @-@ album . not all the cameras make this information available . in the section lateral met@@ a data you can consult what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually off , and in this case , it stores &amp; digi@@ ous ; the photos directly from the target album . if you want to change this option , use the button labeled and select the Dat@@ eline @-@ based under@@ name at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to their camera is the button download . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog box &amp; k@@ de is to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks and digi@@ plug ; you , where the images will be uploaded . select the desired file and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Pos@@ iti@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant that can be displayed in longitud@@ inal and lat@@ itude , and the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photography can be interesting to link an image with a precise ge@@ ographic place . not everyone uses a plane to record an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental pl@@ anners , military , police , architectural office and estate agents can use this ability .
if you miss them later , where exactly the photo was taken , you can click with a click to view the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; user wishes to locate the place of the photos thus , it is good to save the position data of a photos .
the question is , how does the GPS data come in the image ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 is supported by many GPS data fields , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways of reaching the data and image files using the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and last about manual input of familiar locations .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated GPS unit . but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers . either as a map module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR R@@ ico@@ h Pro G3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ one or G@@ PS@@ Babel . however , they must save those data in GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the Ge@@ ograph@@ ical arrangement module .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you want to know the length and lat@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itud@@ inal and other data , then you can use this script using the ex@@ if@@ config utility by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of coated coordinates , e.g. by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street types . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ der , she tries to give you so much control over its operations as possible . there are many settings , which have to change the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ ous ; set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be displayed on rec@@ ted pre@@ viewing or starting image processing . so you place the default behaviour of &amp; digi@@ ous ; ti@@ ghtly , when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains how shown below , the standards did@@ actic and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , when the option is synchron@@ ized in the IP@@ TC data . this data is also written in the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for the author . this field should be the profession of the photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author , it must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify the photo . this should not be the author unless this is a picture agency like Reuters or Associated Press ; if the picture is a bearing picture , then the group or agency should be at your disposal here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions save the data in the respective IP@@ TC Fel@@ low . this causes the metadata permanently contained in the image and not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ ous ; these metadata is also available in &amp; digi@@ ous ; and they can be imported without losing .
mem@@ or@@ cs as embedded labelling ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : these synchron@@ izes the comments which you include too to your photos , which are contained in pictures that are already embedded in pictures , they are over@@ written by &amp; digi@@ ous .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear in the main window over a file . according to the selected option , this information will appear or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug , a number of different video formats and some video formats and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ p@@ ite , you can specify the file extensions of this list ; source folders which has no such extension has been ignored by &amp; digi@@ plug .
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the button update on the right of each category .
the settings of the light of &amp; digi@@ ous ; can be put on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can only get on fast computers . if you have one , then you can obtain better view results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can select it here . you can use the tool bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bri@@ ghter colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this picture mode can be switched off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ sampling , the images may be encoded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the close account .
with P@@ NG @-@ compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation is not reducing the image quality because P@@ NG has a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . this means that 1 : a low and 9 means a high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF @-@ files , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate comp@@ ress mode for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF output . it does not influence the image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is loss@@ less .
with the loss of loss JPEG 2000 files you can save loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files . even if you have written the loss set setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata is not yet supported but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ ous , the image processing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it evol@@ ves very quickly to manip@@ ulate your photos . with this dialog you can change the image processing settings .
the default is that all green pixels are identical . if you are using this option , this difference is a bit soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option disc@@ erns the picture a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ ing pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , whit@@ ef@@ ields will be used to the camera . otherwise , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white background is not set . it is used to use solid colour balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white map that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . the use of the second sensors have the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps will get more detail in the sh@@ af@@ ers . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is the top light , so the parts of your camera are the sear@@ ed to capture the h@@ ott@@ est white in the settings . in addition , the setting shines through the in@@ ability of your camera . last@@ ly , you can try to re@@ construct quite some parts of the missing information from the top light .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; twi@@ gs try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares of the yet not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question how much colour or white want you want .
when you select option re@@ construct , you will get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be customized for each picture .
set the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ine according to your taste . you will probably have to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the demo type , you should go conservative .
a demo icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the part rock data that have many cameras , and that is known as a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ B , and D@@ cra@@ w , give you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number from gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by myself . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a gra@@ dient correction , since you are performed during the conversion conversion .
one profile transl@@ ates the colour information and releases how they should be given back . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ous ; information such as colour content of a colour space in the other are also transl@@ ating colours as accurately as possible .
behaviour issues , when a picture is opened in image processing , the colour management module will start with raw files .
color Profile folders Send you the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / user / .@@ color / .@@ color / .@@ color / .@@ color / .@@ color ; investigated this file then during start .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the ability &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; you can change your profile settings again when opening the blank file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures colour@@ ing not the entire screen .
the input profiles should be used to the camera head and model you can use . not all profiles are made on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color mapping or g@@ amm@@ ak@@ or@@ if@@ ers . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not necessary for converting at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
there are further options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your printer can work again from one device . this is very useful for your camera and some colors can be saturated . so instead you can manually scale it on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile is intended for them . unfortunately not in the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles to fit together . this answer is , of course , in@@ officially :
the Canon Profile extension makes the style of the goal : F for an accurate style , l for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug @-@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a set of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing is supported ; many modules support to work with any program that supports K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you see a list of the available modules . select the modules that you want to use , and these will appear as new entries in the menu above the main window and beyond .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set manually in the menu under settings .
additional information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found via the K@@ IP@@ I project via the K@@ IP@@ I project via htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the Manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the image passes , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes activate the metadata in or out that appears at the lower end of the images during the ad .
the camera characteristics show on the left side a list of all the time supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is being connected to a camera that is properly connected , switched ON and in the screen mode . currently the port settings are supported here , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported here .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have a USB@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / Camera or / m@@ nt / , specify where you enter your camera .
to use your digital camera with digi@@ plug , you need to connect the camera to your computer , and turn it in the display mode .
check out if &amp; digi@@ der , the camera automatically recogni@@ zes . if not , you can set camera body and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert it all here .
you can view the dialog box dialog for the moving of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin . when del@@ eting a photos in an album , you can find further details when del@@ eting a photos and del@@ etion of an album .
the editorial changes made by the right side bar can be used tac@@ it by &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without rel@@ ap@@ ing . otherwise you have to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also see the display of the sp@@ lash screen of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when starting , it acceler@@ ates the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ ous .
the B@@ m start looking for new photos is for@@ cing &amp; digi@@ ous , looking for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time by &amp; digi@@ der ; if something from the base folder has been deleted , she asks if it wants to delete it from the database .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous ; in order to adapt the main window to your taste . you can select Pre@@ view Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs are defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ ous ; you will find further information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ case ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view and select your photos and the image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview menu and selection of the entry screen / editing .
the image processing contains a range of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; for example , you are not part of your distribution . further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the image processing section .
a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , and the current image size indicates .
one menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common functions .
editing features will alter your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you use File Save or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo you have saved the image .
so you possibly can customize a copy of your picture before you change it . you can save it with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image again by using from the File Recovery or button The button Rest@@ ore Re@@ produce in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change which you &apos;ve done using the photo since last saving .
nearly every action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ o or restored , by editing Edit restore from the menu .
if you are using this frequently , you should turn to the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ z to reverse and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you want to press the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the smoo@@ ther or Rest@@ ore button in the tool bar a moment longer press , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started playing image processing , you can choose between photos in the same album or the same keyword in the tool bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you want to make changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can in the photo set and out zoom in which you choose C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool bar or the entries in the applicant menu .
in order to adjust a photo to the window size , you can choose this button in the tool bar : enlargement factor automatically
view Full screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode . normally you come to the normal view in which you did not want the Es@@ c key . normally you can edit it in the Settings dialog box &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can also view this tool@@ bar ; main window . see the section for setting the image processing .
if you want to print the actual picture , you can print out the menu of the menu and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sets . all image examples are printed out of your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and import printer assistant . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ der , main window has a side bar at the right margin , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is also available , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked on :
multiple click on the same tab leaves the side@@ bar or disappear again .
in terms of writing , you can input or insert inscri@@ ptions with unlimited size or insert the note down . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all fonts are allowed to be used in EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that they can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII @-@ characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comment@@ aries are cut off after 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC @-@ labelling field in other applications , these restrictions should be considered .
after you commented it , you either use the button user or switch to the next picture , the labels will then be saved .
besides the user button , there is a button more . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . but you can also read the metadata into the files . but this will always be done if you &apos;ve selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the section rating shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars . it can be applied to the page bar with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the page bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to rate several pictures at the same time , choose them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field of gency . coding follows the schema in the following table :
the sampling point shows a search box for fil@@ tering the keywords , the sampling @-@ tree and a sel@@ ective box with the previously used in this &amp; digi@@ ous ; meeting displayed .
the keyword tree is adjusted dynam@@ ically to the entered keyword . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the lower end is another relief in the input of entries with a series of images . if you have entered various keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check@@ boxes in the tree . all words of an image are stored in the keyword in the IP@@ TC box .
if multiple images are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the whole selection , read the keyword filters section .
the keyword filters are used to change the selection of the displayed pictures in the main window . usually , the left side bar with their album , - dates , query and search purposes will be used . if additionally one or more sample filters are displayed on the right side , all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop down . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the keyword is already existed , you can simply drag the right side bar and click on the selection . then , a dialog box you ask if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window lists the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is selected on no keywords , which were selected with C@@ trl + a , and afterwards a keyword from the right keyword will be removed . a dialog appears whether this keyword should be set .
this search for changes happens at every start of the program . it can also be switched on various settings .
if you have a rule with and created , and realize that it would be one or should be , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and the rules range .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already in the database .
you can specify an extensive search for all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need to check the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have been basically modified and modified .
the reason why you have a color managed workflow is that the colors of your camera or scanner will achieve a predic@@ table devi@@ ation of the actual photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color@@ less workflow , you can easily print the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner or the colors you want to print out of your digital dar@@ k@@ room .
if the theme is coming to colour management , then everyone wants to know which buttons he would like to make for the results . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to give you adequate background information about colour management . in addition , you will make your own informed decisions that you get your own informed decisions that you get the desired result .
if you comply with all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t need to worry about colour management .
you are currently working on a monitor that has calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space ( see below )
their only other aspect expend@@ itu@@ res are sent by e @-@ mail or the Web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so , if s@@ RGB works so well and that life is so easy for everybody , why should one use another color space and have to worry about colour management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colours we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour gam@@ ut , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour spaces , please visit Bruce Lind@@ lad@@ oms Editor , and then click Info About RGB Working spaces .
do I have to vibr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! if you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to use your monitor , as s@@ RGB here is , so you have to use your monitor in s@@ RGB , then you need to either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , using a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions to improve the image in most cases . therefore , use it before attemp@@ ting to further manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize , un@@ equal , automatic and contrast extend from your colours the best . you will need to experiment the best with these effects . you will be experiment@@ ing with these effects to see which is best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method causes the magni@@ fication values beyond the whole picture , so that the dar@@ k@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point to change without its color sh@@ ady . this function is often a magnetic correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
the same method adap@@ ts the brightness of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity of the intensity is as flat as possible . thus , nearly every brightness of the contrast is generated , sometimes it does not produce a very powerful operation , which causes either mar@@ vel at an image or destroyed it .
automatic waste : this method maxim@@ izes color area in red , green and blue channel . they determine the dark and bright border lines and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the brightness of the RGB value of a picture by moving the lowest and highest values on the wid@@ est possible range and a new ji@@ ust@@ le of all values in between . this is only visible with balanced images and can be good correction for bad photos .
whit@@ ish effects of &amp; digi@@ ous , is a semi @-@ automatic tool to implement white and white photos .
the white un@@ equal correction is somewhat limited because you can have a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , you can perform the tin@@ ting mode in the mode , so your possibilities are better than falling .
this tool is based on a white background image protected by copyright Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m . you can take it over the menu entry colors white and the image processing .
the show@@ case can be adjusted in size . on the left , both the original image as well as the preview of the target picture . the preview can be seen dynam@@ ically the shape of the tool . if you want to see the original protein content , it is enough to click the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ancy of pixels under this mark@@ er is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
a hist@@ ogram appears on the right above , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ine values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on the shade , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow adjustment allows you to improve or di@@ mming the sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ ls of your photos .
login with the af@@ ore@@ mentioned inspec@@ tions , you should use the color temperature pip@@ ette . press on this button and then click anywhere on the image preview to calculate the color temperature of the white @-@ off . on this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white ink with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available :
the super@@ se@@ al@@ ding panel increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixels are over@@ exposed . this will display the combined result in the white background . this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and loading make it exactly this . each setting of the white @-@ file you have set you can save to a text file and load later again .
the button pres@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and the related neutral white @-@ comparison . note that even neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you store it your original image will be changed .
you can set the code depth in each color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this coding also needs more turn@@ table , ac@@ count@@ down and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw material . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the use of color profiles . a detailed guide for the use of colour profiles can be cons@@ ulted in the chapter of color management .
another important tool is available in the menu below colors . this tool is an integrated path that allows you to adjust several color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always use the same error and therefore you always need the same correction . in the manual for audio correc@@ tions , you will find further information .
a very powerful opportunity to correct expos@@ ing problems is the tool for gr@@ it , that you can find gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ plug case ; tool color effects will provide you four color effects , a Vel@@ via filter , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , even Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that emerged after a partial pressure of a short lightning . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar panel . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . finally , another incre@@ ment produces that so is not to produce phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar power buffer . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the revised intensity ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that makes it a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . simply try to em@@ bell@@ ish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an unusual painted colour film manufactured by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ via offers very satisfied colors in daylight and high contra@@ sts . the Vel@@ via offers very saturated color but also some photographer , especially those who under@@ side the little landscapes , too much .
the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on light to the contrast channel . the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repet@@ itions the thickness of the Ne@@ on@@ light . with large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos . once you are satisfied with the results you are using the button O@@ k and you will be used .
if you get a photo of bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation take a good choice to enhance the satur@@ ation . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool needed to improve the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need for the purpose of the use only the range of sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ ogram .
the window includes a graph of intensity levels , an hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph@@ s , three sli@@ der can be clicked into the picture , the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use is the controller to move and take care of how the image changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be seen . preview is dynam@@ ically updated , based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the hist@@ ogram can be displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear Hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic scale is more useful .
three knob : the top for dark tones used for light tones and the lowest for middle tones , frequently Gam@@ ma@@ der values .
the three color brush characters can be used in preview of the original image to adjust the inputs of the shade , medium and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values are the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used here as well . the compression of output values can be used for example . the compression of output values can be used for this , a hidden picture can be seen as background while something else is fore@@ seen in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the image values of the image .
save as and load : using these buttons , the set values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and re@@ loaded later . in addition , Gimp &apos;s level format will be used .
if you are using this mode and three color pip@@ ettes , once you use the color pip@@ ette you want to use the color pip@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the Hist@@ ogram program for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ as .
the option instru@@ cts allows all color channels to indicate over@@ exposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator that means you can only see the effect in preview and no effect can be seen during the final result .
below you can see an example of the adjustment of the procedures applied to red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . pre@@ viewing will be dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
modi@@ fying channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel which will be changed from the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures which have been recorded with a digital camera , linear mode is generated by a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps further .
for example , if you move a cran@@ age right to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can corresponding that these bright tones are correspon@@ dent and the corresponding picture pixel are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos , a red marking is displayed . if you wish to change this marking on the curve , a matching line is shown on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can make exactly this . every curve that you created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format is the Gimp course format .
if you make this method and the three color pip@@ ings create automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , central and solar tones . activate the color pip@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the In@@ struc@@ tor option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is a indicator that means you can only see the effect in preview and no effect can be seen during the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo which was adjusted in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ canal . shadow and solar tones were used with the color pipe and the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ der ; image processing is a tool to enhance the color channels , or change the color sh@@ ady of the photos .
the channel mixer is another high @-@ developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu @-@ channel mixer of the image processing .
using the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram . this gives you a first hint as you can correct the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows a preview of . the original can be seen for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . when positioned this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the respective color value .
the controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ators for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels as well . if you also enable the option of mon@@ och@@ rome , as the channel mixer is enabled to reduce the colour channel for creating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color to a visible noise , which looks from the colour of color . if this is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you can reduce the colour space first .
saving and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer settings will allow you to save and then load . the file format is the Gimp channel mixer format .
the option instru@@ cts allows all color channels to indicate over@@ exposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator that means you can only see the effect in preview and no effect can be seen during the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the original image is stored under ( 1 ) and the original image is shown below ( 1 ) .
black / white photograph was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photographs , black / white is a work step , because colour images can be easily converted to the machine . also with a set of film material profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good for all scenes and fits very well to portraits against the sky . thus , similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange film : sim@@ ulates a black / white film expos@@ ing with an orange lin@@ ter filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) or@@ an@@ ges .
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film expos@@ ing with a red linear filter . this creates dramatic asc@@ ension and can sim@@ ulate sc@@ y@@ li@@ ents to the day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Red filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm light and medium tones while keeping a bit cold in the shade . this is very similar to the process of the lead and re@@ development in a sep@@ sis . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similarly to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ har@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
when brow@@ ned with the digi@@ ous tool , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on one image .
by adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the car@@ ving of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for this .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of depth and tri@@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper reading effect was taken on the picture below . the original image is taken ( 1 ) and changed ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
with the digi@@ plug , tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to a picture .
holding the eye of an ob@@ tain@@ er in the boundaries of an photos is no easy task . this is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . this is a psychological barrier to the scatter@@ ing eye . in the picture frame , the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter you put the desired frame of the frame for your picture . with a thin line , down with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , gro@@ unded it with a nice three @-@ dimensional setting . ideal for a b@@ stone nail and decoration inser@@ ts a ornam@@ ental frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
that with the frame decorated with the frame image becomes greater than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially when you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert easily a format@@ ted text in a picture at any point . this goes well in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . the larger the image size must be adapted . the larger the image , the larger the character set must be adjusted . to the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting which you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you press the button &quot; OK &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore .
with &amp; digi@@ plug , tool templates can be applied to a template on a template .
the View Image template used in the image processing can be used to put templates on an image .
for sten@@ cil there is no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file size and should be adding with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template ; send you an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mailing list digi@@ plug @-@ user @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your template @-@ file with the button base folder in dialog . select the folder into which you have copied templates for the next start .
once the root folder has been set for templates , a build view is reflected in the folder structure of the template folder . the template &apos;s template is updated automatically .
under the preview are three buttons , which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the shown image . it is cent@@ ered around the position of your mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
Re@@ duction : this button resi@@ des the lower picture below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template around the image , you need to shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image lying below . take the image and put it in the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template onto your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ der , three different tools are available for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ed is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
the sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture of shar@@ per . actually it &apos;s not a bit , it &apos;s been working rather psychological and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is copy@@ righ@@ ted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
focus is perhaps the best of the three because it truly improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as the most digital images need a correc@@ ting of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the result of the dig@@ iti@@ zation of colors must be combined with only minimal differences in colour . the same phenomenon can be seen when color highlights are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras will normally need more in@@ toler@@ ant than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG image , the camera has often been applied to internal shar@@ pen@@ ing images . in contrast , images in the pipe format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some scanner turn a shar@@ pen@@ se filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can obtain useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness value , that can be viewed with the menu entry .
with this , however , carefully handle it , since the results are not very natural : sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you can find out more information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too scar@@ c@@ ely . the solution , which image is a little soft to draw . use the tool to draw a bit soft and experiment a bit with Settings . the show@@ case on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter f@@ avo@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool for removing ve@@ ils from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview can help process the image . the show@@ case shows the display of the filter with the current settings .
there are two key parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values produce often good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius and the amount should be tested first . if you create the bl@@ ur@@ red mask , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats are created near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels are affected by the filters on each side of the filters . high resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . they should be sharp@@ ly sharp@@ ly in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped picture added to the original . thereby , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is placed .
the Corpor@@ a value is a fra@@ ction from the maximum RGB value and the apply difference result . this way , it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for a duct of the filters . in this way , areas with a soft change is excluded , and therefore mostly f@@ law@@ less in faces , cel@@ est@@ ing and water surface .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp@@ ly mas@@ king filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . in@@ sharp@@ ly mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , sum = 0.5 and a Corpor@@ a = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ der , tool Re@@ focus transl@@ ates a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the protected directory @-@ design algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ si@@ zing quot ; in which it is a better way to shar@@ pen the picture . it is better using a technique called F@@ IR Wiener fil@@ tering . re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing mostly achieved better results than in@@ sharp@@ ly mas@@ king . you can start from the menu by pressing colours re@@ focus in the image processing .
in practice , the circular flow works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung . the G@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of G@@ auss , which is far from the original source , is influenced widely from the original pixels , even very strongly influenced by distant pixels . it causes unwanted results .
circular hot : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the main parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should set good results , but if your image should be very un@@ sharp , but then on Hei@@ ligen@@ repro@@ ach .
correlation : there can help a correlation of correlation . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
noise filters : an increase in the cat@@ er@@ filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 but are rarely useful . if the noise filter is too low . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will continue to over@@ write the image .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . this is the most common to avoid acci@@ dental radi@@ ance . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the cat@@ er@@ filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation unit . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular hot or the G@@ auss &apos;s focus . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any re @-@ focused parameter that you have set is stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all tri@@ mming , pain@@ t- and intensity classes on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before moving to the picture . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; when JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp masks produce better results as sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by sharp@@ ness that uses a large neighborhood as sharp@@ ness .
theore@@ tically you can always create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is always at least as good as the Un@@ sharp@@ ness M@@ ask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small , focused image , see :
the original un@@ sharp colour picture needs to be corrected . this picture was taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information about the focus on the shar@@ pen@@ al structure in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the knob has turned the sharp@@ ness of the area to be bl@@ acked out to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour ink enables a modified color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed mold to remove non @-@ desired arti@@ facts with un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented rate .
the algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains several pres@@ ets as star@@ base to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can do the tab for smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail pre@@ serv@@ icing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a smooth glass of smooth and smooth details . a value of 0.9 % should be provided so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be in@@ compatible . please note that the detailed maintenance is always subject to liability @-@ dependent .
direction depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ th@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 in one direction . if you have a film mes@@ hing , a high value of wind generate similar patterns . JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts are best removed with a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ es@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . hence set this value to the level of sound in your image .
Reg@@ ular@@ ity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects more structures . the higher this value is set , the more is needed , as it is difficult to estimate the image geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : returns how often the algorithm is passed . usually here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angular extent given &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected , it should also be small , so that small angle should be chosen a long runtime . thus , you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integr@@ al stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ al stri@@ de length in pixels . you should avoid the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never exceed 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the more quality you want through choice of this option is only low . it doubles but the runtime . we therefore recommend it to permit him .
the Save as and loading make it exactly this . a text file can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded again .
image errors correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it may last very long to draw and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore cancel the calculation anytime with the button closure .
below you can see how imag@@ ery can be removed using little arti@@ facts . the module is shown on a photo that was caused by an analog camera in Guatemala City . as you can see it is a unique black arti@@ fact that is causing the original picture below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ der , rou@@ gh@@ reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool is available to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens , it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects from scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about the sensor noise of digital cameras , you can read these in English in this tutorial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene that was done with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise which can be removed with this tool successfully .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you will need only the sub@@ window details and the advanced settings can remain at default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filters . large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can display the image and the color in it becomes smoo@@ ther and thus smaller mistakes .
sharp@@ ness : determines the sharp@@ ness that determines the pixel pitch in front of the filter . if the value is increased , you may need to change the edges of the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details do not get more and noise or shame can occur again .
edges : control the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not occur the whole cat@@ ches or noise peaks . set it on a value near the maximum amount when you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts if you want to lose without details .
lumin@@ ance : determines the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these att@@ itudes do not affect the smoo@@ thing process which is controlled by the details .
colour : controlled the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to enhance a picture . these att@@ itudes do not affect the smoo@@ thing process which is controlled by the details .
gamma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker ranges , which are typically more rough , but it does not stain the shadow zones .
d@@ amping : determines the adjustment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is lifted up , the edges appear on the edges . it can remove rust@@ le and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges . it can be loos@@ ening and is the recommended method for this .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how the reduction of your lives can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected point with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . using the tool to draw a little soft so much easier than an image is using the menu entry and experiment with the glass door . the show@@ case on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo .
die &amp; digi@@ ous ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo ar@@ te@@ facts .
this filter to restore gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undes@@ irable arti@@ facts , scrat@@ ches , scrat@@ ches , scrat@@ ches , compression ar@@ te@@ facts and local mistakes in digital , original , or later dig@@ iti@@ zed images , thereby receiving the content as it also makes human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for pain@@ t- and texture rendering , using the text error correction . the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ kre@@ i and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Arte@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ fact quot ; - small standards that are shown in the un@@ compressed image .
the Save as and loading make it exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded again .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore inter@@ rupt the calculation anytime with the button .
below you can reduce how to reduce a photo with a visual noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ ori@@ ous film version on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old colour photo taken with a scanner . you can see the scan @-@ arti@@ facts that are caused by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and photo scanner . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ der , tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove any photos with a CCD camera , eight were used . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are particularly a problem , because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ trac@@ ing method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button Dark . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . they are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels using CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right dark image to correct image . an automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixels . note that the assistant re@@ members the last night@@ fall and will automatically re@@ charges in the next session .
the image area and preview can help you correct the result . the display window displays the display of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all pro@@ positions .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ham : it is determined by average of the pixels . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation it is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less are raised to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used for pol@@ ishing the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , using a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ der , Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool for correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. , exposed corners to correct an image .
wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they can reduce the edges and edges of the picture by reducing the light the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ objective shows also this behavior .
however , it also has dis@@ advantages . many centers filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture table , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used , even with Center @-@ filters , an opening from f / 16 or smaller , otherwise bl@@ ur@@ ring effects arise through movement .
with the large layer of exposure to current felt and pain@@ t- and colour printing from digital cameras and film scanners , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ Filter by using a Center@@ Filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three controllers you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter , and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light weigh@@ ting at the point of the biggest density . the standard density is 2.0 , or at random an aperture level of 2 , or random and increases the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting .
cand@@ le@@ strength , contrast and gamma @-@ settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the goal with these options , as you have to raise only positive values , since you only need to raise the settings .
if you want a more sensitive new adjustment of the purpose of the target , let the values for brightness / contrast / Gamma arrive at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing from the menu Colour Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction to apply to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correct picture . a ampli@@ fication and contra@@ sting correction was also performed with this tool .
the digi@@ plug came , linear dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geometric dist@@ ortion . colour dist@@ or@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second ridge handles the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ fin@@ ed form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect effect , fl@@ atten@@ s off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth gravity correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second gravity . if you can combine these two geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion , almost eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of dist@@ ortion second . with negative values can be corrected ton@@ ic dist@@ ortion and positive values c@@ low@@ out dist@@ ortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of dist@@ ortion 4 Gra@@ des . this value acts stronger than in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameters has the opposite sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value scale the image size and thereby leads to the correct degree of gravity . negative values might increase during positive the picture .
clear : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase .
in order to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview the dist@@ ortion correction . the values you are using for your image are stored and used for the next start as default values .
the t@@ ooth@@ - resp@@ ann@@ ular correction should be carried out before all tri@@ mming or size changes . the effect is best to cut and then perform a t@@ ooth@@ form correction , the effect of seem@@ ingly fal@@ tering .
to help you find the best correction to find you to view this tool a vertical and a horizontal support line . move it to an important place in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ ic / ho@@ ver@@ ed dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a ho@@ ver@@ ed dist@@ ortion , the resulting picture will correct black edges . you can remove them from image processing or zoom out of the zoom .
for most pictures , the tone @-@ shaped correction from the front is not enough . the next logical step for some mot@@ if@@ s like photos from the front , frame and paintings are to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ic correction used to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this movie has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left of the window you can select the area for preview . when you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters for fil@@ ming and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to sim@@ ulate the fine texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of fil@@ ming and the domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in converting . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter colour channels are mixed with infrared film , particularly the green channel makes no sense apply to black / white photos , as the colour information are missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter model applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the original image was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate an art of aura at the top .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter fil@@ ming is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ produce film baskets as such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of the films that make the manufacturers big cor@@ pus of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosph@@ eric gift from everyday life . if you want these special , gallery @-@ like , tram@@ way sight , especially in your mon@@ och@@ rom@@ atic photos , you have to use this filter .
with the knob , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to the control of the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , if you still need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of a fil@@ en@@ oid effect applied to a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) for the used film hyper@@ sensitivity to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the digi@@ roll came ; filter oil paintings produced the appearance of an oil paintings . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ plug , filter oil paintings , gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural images and sty@@ list@@ ic life are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the size of the brush between one and five . thick brushes are better suited for large images . smooth the smoo@@ thing or , from the other side , the hin@@ der@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil paintings effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the co@@ worked is marked with the ( 2 ) brush size for this 640 pixels wide image is 1 and smoo@@ th@@ te 17 .
der &amp; digi@@ ous , filter coal record uses pain@@ t- and intensity gra@@ dients in order to define an carbon@@ ic effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you could have chosen to sk@@ etch yourself . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the output filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default values of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug painted the filter engraving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a protected algorithm created by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , in which colour is not the most important content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ dar@@ ous landscape .
depth also allows the contrast to the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the revised image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter assembly you can transform a normal picture into a work of art by dist@@ ortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wavelength 1 : divide the image into cells and makes it look like if it is considered by glass blocks .
shaft 2 : similar to the wavelength 1 the image will be dist@@ orted here with a different version of g@@ lass@@ blocks .
some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can always break these effects anytime with the button end .
this filter assembly allows you to transform a normal picture into a work of art by means of tra@@ def@@ ensive effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom in bl@@ est : caught the image along busy lines that run from a center . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ meas@@ ur@@ red camera and thus produces a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ ally Un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the image by rotating the pixels to a focus . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ meas@@ ur@@ bility of a rotating camera .
range of distance : explo@@ des the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back into the background .
motion sharp@@ ness : caught the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ meas@@ ur@@ bility of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographic photo , camera .
soft@@ ly sharp@@ ness : caught the image soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this is ideal to create romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle light .
Schüt@@ ting sharp@@ ness : explo@@ res the image by a random shift in pixels and sim@@ ulates the im@@ min@@ ent of a arbit@@ r@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent un@@ sharp@@ ness : find the basin in the picture and explo@@ it the rest without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel rate .
some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can therefore inter@@ rupt this calculation at any time .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ing on your image . this makes it natural your images a wet look . it uses a pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by copyright .
drop size allowed it to change the size of the drop . because the sample size is not automatically added with the size of the image , it often changes the size and density of dro@@ pl@@ ets . number changes the optical effect of the drop in the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ der ; image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . to do so , use the range tool in order to remain free . if you start following the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of a reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ed filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the converted picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can flip it by mirrors or spin the right orientation . the tools you can find in the menu Trans@@ forming Chang@@ ing or Trans@@ ing Each Other .
Foto @-@ infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo in a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is simple . the big question is , how can you get a picture of infl@@ ating or guess the details ? how can you render the missing information re @-@ invent or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is used here , make it a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose a shift size change in the menu and type the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool for size change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the infl@@ ating tool .
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ ous , uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in tab new size and are listed below :
correct aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the new size is maintained in the original image of the original image .
Reg@@ ular@@ ity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects more structures . the higher this value is set , the more is needed , as it is difficult to estimate the image geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the Save as and store are used exactly along with that . any inser@@ tion for photo can be stored as text file and downloaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very quick in what it does , but it can still last very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can stop the calculation anytime with the button end .
you can see below an example of a picture on the picture , by increasing a small color picture to the double size . the original ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication .
cutting a photo is not only a commonly conducted operation , but also a frequently under@@ rated tool to comp@@ ose a picture . the image clean@@ up simply allows you to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and ascending the rectangle , then you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut out . this allows you to make a good overview of your photo by drawing . a new rectangle makes you create a new rectangle by moving it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting button , use the button Der plu@@ ck button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl + + X ) . use the entries file storage or file storing under the menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the screening area you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains .
in the tool In case of aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as high @-@ format or landscape aspect . in the aspect ratio the greater value of the height and in the trans@@ verse format is assigned to the width .
the tool is using a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same as you can use cen@@ timet@@ res , In@@ ch or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional profiles for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons to select the selection can be cent@@ ered horizont@@ ally or vertically .
bottom in the dialog you can set with the Max ratio button to cut the range into the maximum possible , depending on selected ratio and orientation .
the tool is based on an aspect ratio , depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . the revised image measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut picture and do not represent the original image .
the att@@ itudes of co@@ aster help enable help to hide your pictures in better shape . these help are :
harmonious triangle : harmon@@ ic sub@@ missions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles at the diagonal .
golden center : the golden middle is a pitch the spread to various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of Naut@@ il@@ us mus@@ sel or the leaf leaves of a sun@@ flower . it dives into all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden partition is the ir@@ ration@@ ale number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have already used the golden partition in all times when you build your temples and pyr@@ amids in all times when you put your paintings , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the standing part is equal to 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is normally follows as a visually harmonious .
the golden middle represents liquid auxiliary lines when you encounter a picture . these help are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your first pics . in comparison to the third @-@ sail gel the golden spiral has a liquid line of the eye can follow through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the spiral along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric course on this way .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rectangle . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to direct the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this something can be simply because of being without the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden triangles are also shifting from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . their ver@@ tices are the main points of the sides of the golden rectangle . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no uni@@ form@@ ative triangles . diagonal to place on these lines can be seen a static object dynamic .
when you use Golden Tri@@ angle to set your frame around you create an effect of wrap @-@ like dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus at one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t reach .
the options horizontal and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonious particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of lines to your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image of any angle .
if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the Free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the button pre@@ ferences you can reset the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right side .
for your help the module is available a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to move the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the image you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after turning a picture , you will find unwanted dirty holes in the corners . one way to repair it , it is possible to utilize the transition from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is Automatic crop . select one of the following options :
option Anti @-@ ali@@ asing spar@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . but please note the above warning .
all spec@@ tr@@ tiv@@ ic transform@@ ations are carried out to a fixed point of the reference point . this point is depicted in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture . the preview will then be automatically created . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty areas which are formed by transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty areas which are formed by transformation , in pixels .
angle to the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left edge of the connected area .
angle right up : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed loop .
angle to the left : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left edge of the connected area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed loop .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit poll@@ uted . for a single adaptation this effect is small but two customiz@@ ations produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you un@@ fit the prosp@@ ect you will get un@@ pleasing tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it , it is the image with transform@@ ers cutting off from image processing .
the sc@@ oring die is used to move part of the picture in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . this is no rotation , the picture will be dist@@ orted . with other words , a rectangle will be converted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transform@@ ers .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical corners . if you press pre@@ ferences , the angles are set to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target are displayed on the right of the sight .
after your help , a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point as e.g. the lake to fix a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to adjust the lines to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the lock , the picture gets a bit wi@@ ped . for a single sh@@ ear , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gi@@ bly , but two ch@@ ings should avoid twice as much w@@ rest@@ ation and therefore you should avoid this .
after etching the picture has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these , it is the image with transform@@ ers cutting off from image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ous , requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write cap@@ tions . the available formats are therefore compiled by your system and , in some cases , from the way like those libraries comp@@ ile were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you can edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ous ;
due to this dependence of other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats supported on its system , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF to them .
&amp; digi@@ der , only shows files in formats . this happens based on the file extension and compar@@ ing it with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is shown in the list . you can change the file in the image processing . you can change this list of file extensions , e.@@ g . in section configuration you will find further information .
nearly all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras can even select you to select format . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression technology to digital images . redundant information is reduced to save the image data to an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , gl@@ itter@@ ing outcomes than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save any loss if that is indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the picture format , you can read about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Far@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour highly helpful guidance in English . you can convert raw material images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image ver@@ ters of &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ ous ; .
&amp; digi@@ ous , one supports the loading of raw material only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ ous ; this allows you to see more than 200 raw file formats . the table below shows a brief list of raw materials that came from &amp; digi@@ ous ; supported by :
many digital cameras will support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format , and therefore don &apos;t have any film processor . &amp; digi@@ plug , the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies use to start playing the program for playback .
go forward to the previously visited album in chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you go back before .
synchron@@ izing the metadata between the database and all files of the current master window . the images will advert@@ ise the database &apos;s metadata and not different from this menu .
link input of the K@@ IP@@ I module for manual , automatic turn / mirror to the current picture with orientation in the EX@@ IF information .
sorted all images in the current album by their name , path , date , file size or rating .
starting all metadata between the database and all the files , i.e. not only those in the current view as with this menu . the metadata database is over@@ written by the data from the files . the different variant can be started from the menu .
all configured cameras are listed here . you can use the index camera to add from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please refer to the camera section for further information .
K@@ IP@@ I module produces a series of images in a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth Earth .
if you swap the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment of the tin@@ ction module .
many tools you need to make the image processing are contained in &amp; digi@@ ous ; please see your description below .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ness , sof@@ as , smoke @-@ op@@ press , re@@ focus , in@@ sharp@@ ly mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform way of preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ os@@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . left of him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the pre@@ viewing area .
vertically and without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left range shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected screening area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter to be applied to the area below the selected distribution range .
vertical parts . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
position horizont@@ ally . the upper area shows the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview pane and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to display over@@ - and exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general setup .
( 3 ) : the frame to select a preview . you can view this frame with the mouse inside the picture and view it on the part of the picture you want to preview the preview . preview the left part of the dialog box will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all con@@ stell@@ ations from the last use of the module will be noticed .
the page panel features indicate the essential information about the selected image and is declared largely self @-@ explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the key parameters at shoot the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider introduces an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ atures . you can put it with the mouse wheel in or out or move it . put it in the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed . of course , this assumes that your pictures are contained in Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for p@@ all@@ ets . the application can be used to edit color p@@ all@@ ets and to select and use colors .
the pallet files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be installed either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case they are stored in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog range you can select from a list of the installed pallet and browse the folder to files .
the cursor is shown in the pallet view as line . it can be moved by clicking in the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . colour is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor down . then move the mouse when pressed via mouse button .
if the check box is activated using the button color , the color is inserted into the cursor by cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can set you by selecting the check box under Bei@@ m cursor .
a selection , which has been described as described in the last section , can copy , cut and paste with the actions .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the propor@@ tions of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a line parameter , if three numbers are displayed in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ;
the colors in the pallet and the print selection can be pulled with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then you will find them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for looking from &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the programs that are used in science , especially in science , especially in computer science . so far , there have no need to visu@@ alize the programs . so far , there have been no modern &amp; GUI ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k programs ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ ak@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . graphic programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of an integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( leaving a change in the graph ; the graph@@ s newly calcul@@ ates and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; to open or the graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; component to open
download large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting at around 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to show more than this no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that requires the &amp; graph ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for representing the graph@@ s . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph , every in one &apos;s own window . in the beginning , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in this case the tool bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last open files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screenshot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed location of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
the zoom is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has been changed in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will display :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; if you want to change the change , you may change your choice later . if you want to change your decision later , set up ... use , see also .
if you open a graph outside of a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; -@@ instance , or want to display the display in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph will be split to several sites . the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be chosen freely .
if you are using several sites , you can select whether the parts of the graph , which are to be placed on this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph .
side preview with one on several pages distributed in the graph without head@@ line and with another font
the page again gives the option to specify the behavior if a file has been changed on the hard disk , eg . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or program the program every time .
the page opening is the ability to specify the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or specify in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time will be asked .
the seat management page provides the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not ) or specify the files of the last session .
context menu , which is usually open for one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; it opens further possibilities :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; - Lay@@ out@@ box ; select entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for lay@@ ered graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of lay@@ ered graph@@ s . the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce a few edges as possible as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ directional graph@@ s . it produces representation in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ time model . thereby the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , the same is equivalent to statist@@ ic multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates for un@@ str@@ ati@@ fied graph a spr@@ ing@@ board model . it uses the Fru@@ it @-@ Rein@@ hardt He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ fire trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ ster@@ ed graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm re@@ arran@@ ges the knots of circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a Lay@@ out@@ file , which will then be specified by a shell . the command should give the graphic design as parameters , and the calculated layout of the graph can provide special options , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of the graph ( fixed or un@@ lay@@ ered ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for str@@ ati@@ fied graph ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise it does not appear and the positioning menu will be in@@ active .
displays the -@@ mouse po@@ inter at . click on a &amp; GUI ; item to get further help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ log in the root folder of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following programme :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find further options .
the main window of the Symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for character tools , the stat@@ us@@ bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid , in which you draw the symbol .
creates a new icon . if the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog where you can select whether the icon will be created from a template , or whether you want to start ane@@ w .
provides the last revers@@ ing step back again . if you do not have a step , this function is disabled .

the K@@ IP@@ I module pictures make tools available to read new images and en@@ rich them .
this module can be used to en@@ rich and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan scan : use the K@@ oo@@ ka Interface to read images from a scanner which is supported by the san@@ e project or another source , such as video streams , so you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and san@@ e installed .
if you can open the menu entry images , a dialog that you can select between all available sources on your computer . choose the source from which you want to pick the image here . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace your image by default in order to select your image accordingly . view the preview size and customize the picture . the estimated file size will appear to you in the right , bottom edge . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
note that the window will be displayed complete , otherwise some settings may not be displayed .
after you have pushed the button down , you have to wait until the scan is finished . here you can select the compression and type of the image file . here you can also select the compression and type of the image file . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 .
the screen photos can be created after you select in the Import menu &gt; screenshot ... button . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop in order to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so you will read other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read after a short delay , the currently visible workplace will read , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen screenshot comes before it starts . if you change to other work@@ space , you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time to navigate .
after the screenshot was made , the dialog options of the target image with the options described above .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Calendar does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I Team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
this module will records your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b burning program . you can simply select the archived albums . an HTML interface can be created for the convenient navigation system . also , the Auto@@ Play option is available for the Windows platforms .
K@@ IP@@ I modules expand the program in which you are loaded in order to integrate additional functions . you can integrate additional menus , key@@ boards and other skills in the program . you can install as many modules within the calling program as you want .

the button photos also should be pushed once you have put all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload . if you click on the O@@ k button start the up@@ loading of the photos to Flickr Server .
the box type can be filled with a separate portion of words separated by comm@@ a . these will be added to the image as keywords during loading .
with the options for public , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ e , you can set access rights to your pictures . by default , the photos are considered to be private .
if you select the option to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in the size . size is taken from the maximum size registered .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . size will be changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery Export is a tool for export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery section currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I Team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the ge@@ ographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keyword of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ alize images of ge@@ ographic in spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system used by GPS and Galileo will be loc@@ alised . height , long@@ itude and lat@@ itud@@ inal modes are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in GP@@ X format . G@@ PS@@ Babel and g@@ ps@@ one can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . to upload a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , this file also contains the same time to the same places as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded automatically , the coordinates will be displayed in red . GPS Spider data is recorded in GMT time and therefore , the camera power will be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here .
the maximum devi@@ ation for the maximum time vari@@ ance indicates a maximum devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera power . is the devi@@ ation below the data collected . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have a track data of a place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the images . the difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate to all images in this area .
the Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and the difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality a location in a large tim@@ difference between Camera and GPS is , you can set these borders here and then cor@@ relate to the button .
the coordinates can be set manually in this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . as the dialog box itself , you only need to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . then choose the relevant region and increase it again , until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the height can always be manually set . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to put GPS data to the images . here &apos;s a small script that the ex@@ if@@ tool is used to create a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool in order to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums which are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will be encoded as UTF @-@ 8 , to allow for best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four Reiter where the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed in a hierarchy . in the area below the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appears in the head of the HTML page will appear .
the tab appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this rider is largely un@@ explained to each page . if you then click on a page , a new page is opened in which the image will appear in the image . otherwise , the picture will appear directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the tab album defines the settings and how to store the gallery with all your related images . select a folder where you have written permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything you will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG format , EX@@ IF data of your original pictures are also stored in the new images .
with other colour depth you can change the default color depth . this also influences the file size . all other settings are explained by themselves .
the tab thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the rider tab for the thumb@@ nails , which are small images shown in the gallery .
a progress window indicates the user at how far the action is . press down@@ break to break the process .
if the module has generated pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the programs in order to verify that error during the production . the web browser will automatically start to preview the preview . click Close to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and implement base operations such as speeds , zoom or shifts . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it was developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG @-@ free module is a tool to imp@@ air images without imp@@ airing your quality .
this module permits the files listed below to save images in JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss of loss is it that is increasing the file size since no compression of colour information is place . this is possible , e.g. in P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has not currently any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I Team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Metad@@ ata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the Mail@@ ing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org by the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of metadata model , you can copy data from one picture to another . in order to copy the image dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will copied by clicking on the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not into any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please check EX@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG coding module is a tool for converting a series of images to a MPEG video in form of a slide show .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG @-@ Video , using a defined length , using the pack@@ ets M@@ jp@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically for the chosen video format . in addition , you can choose a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats of DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the media you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the pictures that will be packed in the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can create the module for ex@@ tras MPEG di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you select will then be listed in the Portfolio section . you can also sort the images or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format may be chosen from various formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and NTSC . PAL is pre@@ set , most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds . the speed of the picture above is specified below . a lower value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . in case of doubt , you can specify the name and path of the created file . keep the extension mp@@ g if possible .
if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have all settings adapted to your needs , you can then go fast or in all peace and enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the button settings right below .
print assistant allows you to print multiple images on one sheet of paper together in standard print sizes . the combined images can also automatically be opened with the image processing The Gimp is : for example , to improve or print directly with the Gimp module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM formats .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . you don &apos;t expect it from d@@ cra@@ w to get the same results as the software from your camera maker . sometimes you get better results ! .
first , choose the RA@@ W file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values again to optimize the conversion process . the first option is to adjust the camera values for the white background . the essential parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera is working in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and the file extension is equal to . JPEG uses a funny algorithm and is produced for the smallest file sizes .
the privacy image format , TIFF , reserves all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
in case you proceed to process your pictures frequently or later , you should not choose to use the JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adjusted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that are included in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use playback .
the pile processing mode allows you to convert various images at once . use this mode therefore if you are safe , e.g. by testing at a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to version for individual images . however , they have the possibility to write the existing file automatically . this is helpful if they have been generated in an earlier attempt . a preview is however not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . use the tool convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the time@@ stamp used .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can enlarge the image and enlarge it . in addition , four kinds of image changes are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in dimension . the width or height of the picture is automatically selected , depending on the picture orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt to your image to the screen format .
not proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
printing preparations : prepare the image for photo print . the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background dimensions , boundary and background colour , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send chosen pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to modify the size of the added images in advance . more pictures can be submitted to the list of images submitted .
after you have started the module , the pictures window will display the thumb@@ nails displayed by you . you can add additional images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image a preview on the right side will appear .
you can also drag and drop pictures to the picture list and add the list of images to be used .
with the button images you will remove the selected pictures from the list of images added .
after you have selected all the images you can open the New message box of your E @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and subject to the subject . the images you select from you are attached as an app@@ endix .
don &apos;t hesitate to ship too many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending e @-@ mails . there might be a good idea to send several mails when you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
in case you are using the Google mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
following the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and included mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu item File Format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files , but it is best to use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG , select file format and the original files in JPEG format are added , then the original Ex@@ if@@ s will be added to the images .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down when looking for errors , however . your e @-@ mail program will start automatically at the end . with the button closing , you can sh@@ ly this window .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you wish to have presented your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ trans@@ itions in the presentation are using very elegant images via Open@@ GL , but you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images will appear in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an end loop . then you can manually break it with the Es@@ c .
the option images random option ensures that the images are shown in a random sequence . so , not the order of pictures in the album is used .
below del@@ aying between pictures , the temporary distance between each pictures can be set between 1.5 seconds and a good value . the best distance depends however on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should know this to show your friends presentation !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . randomly choose between the pictures a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slideshow .
in the lower left of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I Team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the work surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE work surface .
once you have ann@@ ot@@ ted your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo album ; see picture . as you can see by compar@@ ing a comparison with the picture , are now available in each group , so in persons , places and in group keywords .
in the browser window you see the categories , for which you have entered information as you have entered your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current preview images are described .
if you press with the mouse on the entry , change the browser &apos;s view . see picture .
if you select a further person only the images are displayed on which both persons are displayed . by this selection method , you can limit the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand images to a few single pictures .
if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view images of your area .
in the picture each person has the same icon in its name . they can save with &amp; k@@ photo album ; however , for each person , a own fore@@ sight , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have to define yourself . see the picture below .
in order to view images besides the name click the button , which is located on the right outside on the tool bar . please note that you can have the view for each category separately . this is the advantage that you can view the view for each category separately ( in case you don &apos;t have any suitable pictures ) .
you have to choose which image for each individual person is to be displayed . in order to do this , you need to select the image editor in the picture as shown in the picture . here you can select the magni@@ fication factor according to your desires and thus select which part of the image will be shown or cut off .
when you start searching for the entry in the main window , a dialog box is displayed , which is very similar to the dialog for the for@@ ti@@ fication of the picture properties . this dialog box can be seen at the same time .
if you enter a string in the field label or description , you may also enter a date when you want to search for a date ; the date may be either a part of the total dat@@ ory , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images on certain names as you can see in the picture . here , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als but prefer to try functionality , have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , screen photos and introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo album ; and choose the Demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo album ; for the first time , or select a photo album in the menu . after that , some example images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , please visit the &amp; k@@ photo@@ album homepage ; as a related HTML document for downloading .
on the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time@@ bar . a picture of this bar you can see here : as the name already says , this list shows you data statistics on the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display you several different time units . each body displays a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bodies only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the time line can be used for the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview from the database ( if you select a date , the current picture will always display the current date displayed in the preview pane ) and the current date indicates the current date displayed in the preview pane .
you can also select a range of time line by pressing the mouse button , and the mouse over the ruler of the time line , so the time information is displayed . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the time line .
&amp; photo album ; presented to you two possibilities available to create HTML pages with your images . the one is written in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built in the following part of the user manual , which allows you to create ... query the menu file HTML ... query .
before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and finish . in the following , any area will be described .
first , enter the title of the contents and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo album ; HTML example , see an example for these settings .
next , choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo album ; -@@ Export file is to be created on the reviews page . transfer information about the export @-@ files you will find in .
last@@ ly , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . as such , you can avoid that information is displayed by a party . for example , all pictures of a party are available . note that this setting is therefore not available to hide certain images from certain amount .
in this section you can define how the HTML pages are to look like . most settings are clear , which is why they are not specially made .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this allows you to have a monitor and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600 , no images will download the resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time . so he can browse your pictures with low resolution , which results in a slower transmission time . if it is shown to be larger , it changes to higher resolution .
in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
best , choose a base folder for all your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent sentence .
first you need to select the root folder where all of your images will be stored . this folder will be saved and the next time will be automatically added . this folder will enable you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if this is really all available for the viewer . once you have created a web browser after the pages have been created , the URL you need here should be . otherwise , the web browser should start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files are not yet created in the final target folder , you will need to manually copy it into the final target folder . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base file in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the options described above have changed all three to basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you can define in output folder .
if you are looking for a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may have a lot of time to look at the pictures , on the pictures , capture , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo album ; they do not have to do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo album ; you can export a copy of your pictures to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import and imported others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they are certain whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is stored in the file , that you can have all the images in the file and that file is so independent of it . the obvious draw@@ back is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches for the images in a two @-@ way file . first , the images are found in the .@@ k@@ im file format , so the images of the URL you have entered when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for exp@@ orting images are described , which you can export about the File Export menu .
the main option of this dialog is whether to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three choices available to you :
with the manually copy option to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
using the Autom@@ atically copy the .@@ k@@ im file to the .@@ k@@ im file and copy the photo album automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is usually not very small , but if you want to comp@@ ress this , simply select the Export file .
the last option of this page contains Maximum image size limit . if you would like to send your friends pictures , since the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Import menu , becomes &amp; k@@ photo album ; the exported database as described in described file .
the wiz@@ ard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , after , in which folders will import images to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category People who is to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is asked in the third dialog window , which will be imported into the categories of the imported file and which categories they are listed in your database .
in the fourth step , you can select the categories of the present file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the picture .
it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at images you often want to view images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information about your pictures , over ( 2 ) passing through and see through ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ t@@ ations .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it was extended and today your videos have spoken . many places in this manual will talk about images , but often do not include videos with one .
&amp; photo album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the upper@@ most folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy to a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a floppy , or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; remember the folder where your images are stored and used this with future Star@@ ts . if you once want to start a different database tree with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / photo / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
set up the menu entry Settings ; set up to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of user manual , you will be explained the various options .
on the left you can see six different symbols , which allows you to view the preview options and options for the viewer . for each setting , an exhau@@ st@@ ive help is available , which you can call from the button on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described to you as you can set for any picture different properties , e.g. persons , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set complete member groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group will be set up in a group instead of all groups of a central member .
in view of the possibilities you can choose to set the list of members . with the listed selection list you can select the category you want to configure . in the left panel you find a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo album ; shares his modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ plug and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug @-@ in interface . night information on this web@@ page by K@@ ip@@ i .
the modules can be called modules over the menu . the modules can and are not described in this hand@@ book , as they are not sold and sold separately . however , most modules have a help page that you can call over the modules .
since the modules are used together with multiple applications , it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; k@@ photo album ; for this reason , you should always test them with the demo database , using the command line &gt; k@@ photo@@ album \ &gt; or via the Help menu . do not say , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo album ; do not work . this is the down@@ side if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo album ; and other applications that also can use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications include their images in albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo album , this kind of order does not support for some modules , so you can sim@@ ulate the functions with &amp; photo album ;
sim@@ ulates &amp; photo album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , i.e. all pictures that show you the picture preview .
next to the current album &amp; k@@ photo album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here is the &amp; photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category you specified in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums , and if you choose the category people , will do &amp; k@@ photo album ; so if you would have selected people on view and share this on the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo album ; not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog , and select the modules that are to be loaded .
the picture shows an example for a home screen when you start &amp; k@@ photo album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are familiar with any other K@@ DE key you can see at the top one menu and a tool bar . currently , you will not find a lot of information about the tool . currently , in the section , we will not display any information about your pictures , but now please click on the pictures below to show you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the opportunity to see each image of the image , which has been taken on the picture , where the image was taken either individually or for a larger number of images during the same time . if , for example , on all images of Jes@@ per and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see this comment if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view of three lists with a text box by allowing people to set locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you are always using information about your images .
the following idea is based upon the move of images within the list : if you are m@@ apped to the example of a family celebration and above all 50 pictures , the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be moved , so they can be moved closer and assign them .
if you prefer to get a alphabetical list of sorted , click on the symbol for sorting on the list below .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may wish to edit all the selected pictures and make these pictures with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , click the front and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more comfortable to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . they are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the United States as a group . to show you that it is a special group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the program you can add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ type or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also take an entry to a category and put it in order to make this entry into a sub@@ category . attention , this assumes that you can sort your categories in alphabetical order .
you can move the individual elements of the program by clicking the bar that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a window in the frame by drag it outside of the window .
if you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button Options ... that allows you to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also send a frame completely out . if you want to see this window again later , use the button Options ... and click here to view window . see this process in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you get an overview with thumb@@ nails of currently selected images , or all images if you do not have filters . for example , you can configure the thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse , with the middle mouse button , try .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture will be used as background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window is created .
you can also delete images in the picture preview . just select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete and press the Edit menu . now the window will display you see in the Edit menu .
&amp; photo album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo album ; you can also use pictures anywhere in the database . of course , you have to upload images anywhere , that you can view the pictures from anywhere in the database . in the picture you can view the View of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; when not all needed pictures from the hard disk can be loaded .
pictures where the right corner is cut off , not stored on the hard disk . this is , for example , to view the images 1 @-@ 9 . however , the thumb@@ nails appear on the images 1 @-@ 9 . however , you can view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see this function , you need to copy files from folders , and re @-@ copying them . &amp; k@@ photo album ; it &apos;s not necessary to avoid the insert of the associated CD , so please purchase a bigger hard drive to store all the images on it .
in the Edit menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to make a little more privacy , you can filter out the pictures that you can see for others un@@ accessible . alternatively , you can also see all the images that your little sister may see , tick and select the menu items all except current view .
this allows you to set the pictures in the case of the case . if you enter the laptop now your small sister , you simply select the menu entry images that you are locked up , click on lock and lift up the pictures .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection is not very safe . for one , all images on the hard disk and the other can read out or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this kind of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo album ; not very familiar to those looking at private pictures .
the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; of course , you want to describe them . for this reason you want to look at some point . for this reason you have to look at some pictures . this is why you can preview them as described .
the viewer can see you in . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information that you have given through the image , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
in case you want to see the Info@@ Box on top of the picture you want to see them easily and elsewhere . you can also configure the information displayed by clicking on the viewer . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this . when you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Supp@@ ene . as if you selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected .
if you have loads of multiple pictures in the viewer , you can use between them and return , by pressing the keys picture above and below . you can reach the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple pictures are loaded at the viewer , you can then run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo album ; just download a new image after a few seconds . how often it can press a new image by pressing the C@@ trl key and Plus or minus the button C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful ability of looking &amp; photo album ; to change it in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . just use the input button to switch back in full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can put in the image and zoom out . to her@@ al@@ ate you can zoom out a rectangle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom out again . shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of zo@@ oms .
with the point key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown with zo@@ oming . with the equal amount of the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations work with videos that are in and out with the Plus@@ partner and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
with the context functions of the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes about the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu .
when you view images you can see a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . in the moment you can view the view and configuration dialog of the picture to enter this name . however , you will perhaps adopt the image to mark and see further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to see the photos on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer and mark them as good or badly , as you can watch one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features , while you can view them . features include the letters A to Z and you can make a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters . in the event you see an image where features A , B and C are set .
once you have any features on your pictures , they are available to you in your browser . so you can see all the images you want to edit , print or whatever you want . this is described in one module to copy the selected pictures to a CD or whatever you want to make .
categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview pane . if you can view categories in D@@ re feeding view , then simply press the characters for the feature , after the image was chosen . this can be seen here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . this case allows you to paint &amp; photo album ; on the picture .
the painted is not saved with the image , but in the database . you can und@@ o your own later .
in this way you can see a picture on the painting . to shift the painting from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; select on the picture draw on the panel . simply press the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must master the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully master@@ ed , but the documentation into &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire models yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . however , not the object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects already are selected with the object .
to insert a new item in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the tool@@ bar icon or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are many possible locations , the following folding menu will be inserted , so you can choose the correct position :
with del@@ etion either from the menu bar , under the menu or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on Apply to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message with error description will be corrected , then click on application or modify the changes with shut@@ down .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter user documentation in set @-@ up dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the Own View .
press a preview in the Own View and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . by default , the entire texture is rendered with the chosen texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) .
screen picture shows the control points of the camera . you can pull these check@@ points using the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation and also the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag with mouse inside the window .
each object has a sight @-@ level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of the parent , or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility of visibility is smaller or equal to the scene selected in the tool bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as pres@@ et@@ ting . the object tree and viewing of object properties are displayed left and the four graphical displays on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window rules or if you need another arrangement , you can set it freely . you can also store several windows and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below one view , drag the pole to the upper or bottom side of a view . a rectangle indicates the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then ancho@@ red to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over each other , drag the beginner in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the charts on top of the views .
the last possible window commands are pending : views that are not ancho@@ red in the main window . to view a view from the anchor , drag the beginner to the Desktop or click the little arrow on the top left sign arrow in the beginning bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the early Water bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the menu View you can find entries for any kind of views . new views are suspended you can anchor them at any position .
the current window view lets you store with view window commands ... save a dialog box where you can save the window commands below an existing or new name .
if you have generated a scene , you can render it ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be correctly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering Ren@@ dering Symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it specifies the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render an scene in different screen sizes and quality levels , you can choose any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick look up to full @-@ pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the R@@ ender settings icon in the tool bar or select R@@ ender modes , select the following dialog :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that recogni@@ zes the properties of the mode .
in the map map size you can enter the width and height of the fair@@ er image . if you want to render only one small area of the image , choose the check field sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in combination with quality you can select the properties that use &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering , this is done by a very simple pain@@ t- and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered by only a beam per pixel , various errors may occur . these images are often not displayed in a Mo@@ ir@@ onic pattern or stage effects in curves and lines , but details are sometimes not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property see better .
when you turn on Anti @-@ ali@@ asing , and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a jet per pixel . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ ting the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively , recur@@ sively , because every pixel is broken up and adap@@ tive because the rec@@ laim@@ ing of the calculated color depends .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray runs a ray per pixel . if you adjust the values between the color values to the next number of pixels , a grid of 4x4 added value is calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values indicate the specified threshold , the pixels are divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which can be examined individually and to further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be determined by lower@@ ing .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch j@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the latest setting for the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which is diff@@ use reflection reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the associated rays have no object .
open a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; download scene , select the menu entry file for import@@ ing ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; does not yet support the full command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window lists a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code in the original text file in the Editor , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it to the slide tree .
with copying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ der@@ ded . it is usually PO@@ V@@ RAY or x @-@ PO@@ V@@ RAY .
if you click on Help in the Properties view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . set the path to your description and version . also , the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 will be supported .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you enter files that do not appear in the folder , you will need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points on the grid @-@ context menu of the wire model . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turns .
larger values result in a more specific wire model and thus a better wet@@ suit for the displayed objects but require more time to rendering . for some objects like the sphere you can set the detailed mode for two directions .
if you cross High Tas@@ ks for advanced projec@@ tions , all wire model views are further divided , if the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions of perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this feature yields a better approach to projec@@ tions , but requires more time to rendering .
when you tick a wall , a wall is framed behind the objects . the wall is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the floor , dot the floor below the objects . the bottom is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick your can@@ cer@@ ative anti@@ ali@@ asing method , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for rendering scenes is used . the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . in section R@@ ender modes you will find more accurate information .
on this page , you can change existing shut@@ ters or create new window lists . in the window direc@@ tives , as you can create and store windows .
the Combin@@ ation Field Regulation : displays all existing wind@@ ings . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window commands to start the program .
the Add existing window lists shows all existing windows . a new layout can be added with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views of the chosen shut@@ down . new views can be added with the button Add and delete selected views using the button .
the position of the new window . with New column lets you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ites you anchor a flash@@ card view , with the previous view and suspended the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start out with more precise knowledge of both programs . if you can build all steps in this manual , you should get the ultimate in simple scene where beginners can get very popular : one bul@@ let on one level .
but you should consider the following war@@ nings exactly before you compl@@ ain about a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , do not apply rules for rendering , as a result you will receive a black image .
if you do not include light sources , your whole scene is dark and you &apos;ll just receive a black picture .
if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ less , see the first Start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window commands :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their usage .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide , first you must remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select the menu entry collection . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you produce . in particular , the view of the scene is seen from the view of the camera . this shows you the view of the Ren@@ der@@ ns scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation zu &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
change anything in the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved later on the basic settings of the camera , but you can change the camera in view Control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a check point and drag it to the desired place .
when you press the button user or the space bar , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately accordingly to these settings . as a result they see here the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could set out a box ( In@@ sert serial Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a controversial method for resol@@ ving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the button design or the space bar . in the object tree the new name will be shown immediately .
the wire model view also shows the level , even if at the moment , only then a limited plane . when you render the scene , the layer extends up to the horizon .
if you view the object tree exactly , you will find that you can see the entry for the ground if you click on the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . choose one of these options , also change the possible settings in the object properties view .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit among the horizontal lines , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose a shift and set the values like this :
first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select a few times at the moment .
in both cases a dialog box opens in which you can select as the object is to be inserted . please choose the name in the object tree ( name = ground @-@ pig@@ ments ) , with a click on the button preview it looks like the pigment now looks like .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments should only be a material black material , because you can still type settings for pig@@ ments anytime with a click on preview . again , you can now find the colors for the pig@@ ments . again , there are many options , but now take the easiest way .
if you do not preview color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button Apply button and then go to preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following result :
of course , this is not the color scheme you have expected . here you have to enter two new attributes , called Unic@@ ol@@ oured . then select this entry twice ( you can do this as well , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
select it in the object tree any time and change the colors in the object properties :
this step should be able to simply perform this step , since you have already understood the fundamental work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be just as simple as the floor :
in view of object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the space bar or button to press ) , so the ball must move over the floor as you have moved the floor around a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the rendering now yields a strange result : as already shown before , the glob@@ ular surface looks like a material black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
once you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already at the ground , type a pigment as colour :
choose first object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ments . click on the sphere of pig@@ ments , select the color and set the values like this :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take time , add some finish features :
then change the values like in the following screen shots and click on the user or push the space bar .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already produce good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not even chosen :
you should now have a good impression of which possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; I hope you &apos;ve already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a sequ@@ el method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you are ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , the Ren@@ derer hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders scenes ) through every pixel within the scene , and how atmosph@@ eric effects of light sources are reflected in the scene , and how atmosph@@ eric effects work like m@@ ists . thus , the scene files are processed for pixel .
as you can imagine , you will not see without a camera , the camera is your eye when you see the scene . without a light source you see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have saved the model , it will be saved in the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and disk space .
once the scene is re @-@ produced in the last saved version . all changes have been rejected since the last recording .
you can select this menu only if you do not have stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last reverse command . this menu entry can only select when you use the editing .
saves the current window structure and opens a dialog where you can input a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing configuration .
in this menu you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er using this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool bar . you can add and remove commands to this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
a pump @-@ map is a way to manip@@ ulate rough surfaces without any b@@ ump on the surface and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is usual to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as a texture map .
basic body is simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then be mach@@ ined to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis using an image file as a color ticket .
&amp; ball show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and web browser . the application features a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball show ; is very simple . the file browser array files that you can display with clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or return Return .
you can adjust whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog box - &amp; ball show ; there are five card cards . in three of these , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the work of the display and short commands for the browser window , the short@@ cut for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , then the pictures are opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color you can select further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , &amp; ball show ; check the next picture in the folder while you are still looking at the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option , &amp; spher@@ ical show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ball show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background color . it is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . when in the window mode the window is bigger than the image , also the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set &amp; ball show ; so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option is enlarged to the full screen for big images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slideshow will start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .

the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ case ; it is the developer mailing list . guidance to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photos ; .
&amp; show@@ case photo ; try to give you so much control of its work processes as possible . there are many options that make the behavior of the show@@ case ; set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the Symbols of the left side .
in the area of Re@@ vers@@ ation indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ ing or over@@ load display has been selected . sk@@ ill@@ ings should display the colors with what you should display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and exposure of a dark color .
the main window of the show@@ case gives you an side@@ bar at the right margin , which gives you important information and actions at the selected pictures . you can also view this page bar in which you can click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes to scan and save images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan and scan the images which do no more make than pictures and save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner at the san@@ e @-@ project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ com@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line by &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in the terminal . if this scanner will not be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . break down and finish . exit the scanner .
other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options do not apply .
in order to em@@ it a picture , the user can only start a pre@@ h@@ can and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the Pre@@ view button .
in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and out of the current selection out . it can also adjust the zoom so that the complete preview can fit in the window .
when the image is selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you see a preview pane in the settings , the image will appear in a show@@ case as shown below , then the image will be stored and S@@ lie ? EN leads to a demol@@ ition and you get back to the main window .
the button settings will open the same name in front of the main window . here you can change the most important settings .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , the option must be selected .
this setting allow them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can be selected . dialog to save for each picture open the dialog before each scanned images . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , these will automatically store with a generic name in a previously defined file , then you need to ask them without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are stored at the saving without following a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , this folder will be used as default for the dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and also the proposed name for the picture in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image will be numbered as an numer@@ ic Suff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if Cho@@ ose the image quality is not selected , the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button above will start the K@@ DE About -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for Settings and closing can be used to stop and closing .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use as all other programs short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cut and their function . the global short@@ cuts are set up by clicking with the right button of the button in the Player window and set aside Global keyboard short@@ cut by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window and set short commands ...
you may need to set up existing multimedia keys that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Smart commands . this way you make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can be found mostly in other K@@ DE programs . this section is made up of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts . a sample @-@ call for the D@@ CO@@ P function could look &amp; z@@ b ; look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script is not executed due to a lack of depen@@ dency . please check your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog to make users know why a script does not run .
enter the &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is RE@@ QU@@ IRE@@ D for this script . &apos; &apos;@@ k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the scripts / template you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . they will quickly find that writing scripts are relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can exchange your scripts data with amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be attached to each K@@ DE installation .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages enable remote programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; send alert not@@ if@@ ications to all the scripts . this is why they should constantly monitor their default input and respond to events . of course , a script should also ignore events if there is no use .
configure We@@ is the script to display the setup dialog . to store and load the setup data each script needs to take care . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok raises the work@@ folder in the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change signal is sign@@ aled that a new piece is to be played . the script might now &amp; b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the play length ) .
volum@@ e@@ change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer be@@ ween 0 and 100 .
custom@@ menu buttons : sub@@ menu theme Tit@@ le : add the path to the selected files for the playlist , when a user defined menu item can also be clicked . to remove the _ p @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates or when the user stops a script , transm@@ its &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. storage data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages which can be compressed using a web server . such pack@@ ets are available as standard T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can be optionally also available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , allowing users to recognize the archive as an am@@ ok script package as an am@@ ok script .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 it will accept only script packages with the extension of cat@@ amar@@ an script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right .
the script &apos;s script needs to be executable ( + x ) , the remaining to be loaded modules should not be executable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file right :
if your script is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and add the link to the wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use Amar@@ ok ; scripts for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you &apos;ll find only a certain title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s collection browser and the quick search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is still very difficult for you , select dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the correct music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used as you can listen to their music . this and yet many other useful functions make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ live your music !
normally , you must type the following in the base folder of Amar@@ an@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ an@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and automatic use were used , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling it . if you encounter problems , please tell us in the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; has like most applications that can enable or disable the build @-@ time point using the configure command . this is a list of available options .
certain depen@@ dencies have to be fulfilled for some of the comp@@ iling options , so they can be used in the system pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites section .
activ@@ ating de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you wish to help when developing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should take full use .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort across the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
player Window will display the player window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window will be switched off .
note : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the option switches the experimental function of the mood .
impressive design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , thus the used colour scheme for the mood is changed .
playback files with the music files : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files at the location of the corresponding music files are stored . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers are using : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not located in the list .
save the playlist when saving , stores the current playlist to the end of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; activate this option if you do not want to lose the running playlist when you lose .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of music files is stored .
the play can be seen at a single change means that the play@@ lists window will appear - / off , in order to always keep the current piece in the visible window .
when switching to the context @-@ browser , you automatically switch to the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is to be played .
in the section App@@ ear@@ ance you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is part in three parts sub@@ section .
in the fonts section you can select the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ j ; select the following areas . you can select fonts for the following fields : select the play@@ lists window , player window and context browser . if you select the select font , select the font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of customized color scheme you have the qu@@ ay of choice and can define their own color scheme . to this , use the color selection for front and background color .
playback at the start causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start@@ up the playback has automatically continue with the piece on the spot , with which it stopped at the end .
setting up on the On @-@ Screen display allows you to disable the O@@ SD . when on screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is shown and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is font . click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . check the check box shadow that the text is presented in the O@@ SD .
make your own colors use the option to adapt the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . one click on the color box opens the dialog box . if suit@@ ability is not activated , the default &amp; k@@ de are used .
the input field display text provides the text displayed in the O@@ SD . the O@@ SD cannot be customized due to the input of plac@@ eholders . below you will find a list of available space holders and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can define on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment will appear on the O@@ SD .
the audio output card allows you to select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . select a few drivers even further options in this box card .
the card card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to refer to music files . to view a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for inser@@ tion , as with the selected folders .
browse sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will browse to music as well .
changes changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . moreover , an incre@@ mental search will be carried out to make adjustments to your collection .
play@@ lists import : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection @-@ files ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) into your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the Combin@@ ation Field Dri@@ vers : can you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another set up in the MySQL device is needed .
the MySQL device section is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it is used under calcul@@ ator : to enter the MySQL database , on which the MySQL database is reached . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use user name : and password : for entering the data you need to connect to the database .
the load pump@@ .@@ f@@ m is based on the support for last@@ ing@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music @-@ based music recommendations on demand .
here you enter your User@@ name and Password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send the saved pieces and actu@@ alize the profile : this setting makes it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar inter@@ pre@@ ferences : after activation of this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the each played piece may be retri@@ eved . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and the gallery with screen shots .
Amar@@ ok just needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs contained in it , for example &amp; Amar@@ o.@@ c ) . we have written a small tutorial on how to minim@@ ize c@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD holds that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will thus work for example , but we try Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will show a bug in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ an@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also put the broken file that has caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the file again .
most of the time that Tag@@ li@@ bit@@ ing is on the reading of the met@@ a @-@ info from this file system . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version . e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , this leads to crash@@ es when editing the Meta information .
if you are using K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable automatic . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically start with a crash ) . if it is a common back@@ drop , the error will be guaranteed .
this is because many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ info , but it doesn &apos;t define as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist , -@@ f $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use _ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error in writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; , $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script requires the per@@ l script MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be re@@ inst@@ ated with this command : Perl / M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the stat@@ us@@ bar ( random unit ) see always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you will see the status of symbols at K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . however , you can see the status qu@@ ack on grey and half @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you can click a symbol for up to three times until this setting is showing their effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ an error : icon look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ offset pixels . this can be found with ld@@ ok &apos; which cat@@ amar@@ ca &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
in order to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf such that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are clari@@ fying by the help of a expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also help with other users or for developers . use the Forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one error , if something is attached to the correction of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do you now come into music ?
that &apos;s simple . use the File Browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start window was converted into the statist@@ ic window . you will find it with ex@@ tras .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are used for evaluation by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , you must be displayed in the playlist document . click anywhere in the list box , click on the title bar of the playlist . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press on your keyboard . or click with the right button of the mouse on your selection and then choose From playlist to remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist to the playlist and let it drop there exactly how you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the tool bar , directly next to the add button , the button will be saving playlist . click on it .
probably l@@ acks the program X@@ M@@ MS config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ ation , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the Equalizer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it over the menu bar with ex@@ tras .
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question of which media types are supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we can even support text and P@@ NG .
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , so in default there is no MP3 Decoder ( for pat@@ ent@@ ing reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , input space
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ drive driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must be used to use a mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for the same time ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another sink ( eg . oss@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must be de@@ coded for it . you can only search for a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you are reading a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Dri@@ vers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real time pri@@ or@@ iti@@ veness ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure the art@@ sw@@ rac@@ tor SU@@ ID is set :
in K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause de@@ pressed play . read this mistake report . the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get all the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Dri@@ vers . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all your components . register @-@ register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in IR@@ C channel # g@@ ou@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ o@@ peg before ! ) : - Download the ff@@ m@@ peg file , comp@@ ile and install it . then delete the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with auth@@ ori@@ ze config / g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the zip register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please tell them under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , please send it best to our mailing list : amar@@ ok @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pushing the burning button .
a previously read DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialog window appears commonly used after reading a DVD in the contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read out video , coding settings , and even options for changing the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the specified medium . this information is presented in the contents and contain the characteristics of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small glue appears on the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
modify the folder view , or from . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents are activated , their contents have a context menu with functions like media info , lock and unlock the running , or e@@ ject the medium .
switches the contents on or off . the contents then allows selecting and pulling files into the project view . the contents are also selected to read audio or video CDs as if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
activated the head strip in the projec@@ ting view . the head strip is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area that contains open projects only . the head strip has no real function , it looks only hand@@ some and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to change the key assign@@ ments for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after you select one of the available commands in the top part , you can adjust the key additions below .
this will start K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . so you can set up the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator privileges are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
open the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b should work out . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alization and for the definition of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de applications , also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functional scope , therefore , your taste and type of your task is crucial if you specify the default program you have .
in this chapter we will use that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make sure you have the command line program d@@ co@@ p . you must first make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then you specify something like the following one :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program reported , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for generating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref curr@@ ent@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void copy@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void copy@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void frame D@@ v@@ d ( ) void frame D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ c@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ c@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one can get a reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d ) and then a reference to the project via # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project This reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ ways ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ ways ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) void set volume ID ( Q@@ string path )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / Bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b cre@@ ate@@ c ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ zo@@ the fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT of cre@@ ate@@ c / home / tru@@ ste@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ader ; is an audio CD ; it can be read @-@ out and stored in MP3 or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ An ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many co@@ ders to en@@ code these WAV files ( loss@@ less packages ) . more co@@ her@@ ders may still be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the tracks of the &amp; CD are read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per track ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ il@@ ei@@ .@@ cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this has not yet been installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ her@@ ons are already installed , it is very likely not necessary to comp@@ ile any other Linux distri@@ butions , but only the Ko@@ di@@ ers will need to be used . if FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary .
which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ il@@ ei@@ c . this program is not provided to read any copy protection , it is not possible to read a protected audio CD . in any case , it is not possible to avoid the copy of copy protection . just avoid buying the copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup dialog has to be performed only once ( the setup dialog it is possible ) , following the daily use of a &amp; CD . this leads ( hopefully ) for understanding the slim approach of the user interface , via which you will stum@@ ble on the beginning .
can be converted to many formats - depending on which coding times are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can print &amp; CD ; retrieve information from the Free@@ DB file or works entirely without network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example , further information , such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program configuration .
starts the CD@@ DB inquiry on the CD data according to the setup of inquiry in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , the latter case must first be connected to the Internet . )
to start reading and - if an encoder is configured in the alignment settings in the setup d@@ alogue - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default . it is said to have previously configured in the encoder card settings in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected to en@@ code instead of a full &amp; CD . read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as protocols , be@@ eps ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ates ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ An ; with different card cards ( like Encoder , for arran@@ ging the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter covers audio quality , co@@ ders and compression rates and helps you with choosing the correct Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
if there are no audio information to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the advantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files .
in the audio formats that lose information from data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may present a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences will produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality in deeper bit rates .
OGG - if only music will be heard from a computer or machine based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special Auto @-@ Stereo system . today - at the beginning of 2009 , these devices usually support only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and subsequent compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set &quot; standard &apos; = This setting is usually acceptable for most people and most un@@ acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex plays of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approximately 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all tracks of a title . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and car circuit systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information which is pressed manually or through the program is automatically fet@@ ched from the Free@@ DB , are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be delivered with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ set ; and the code @-@ file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with codi@@ fication programs , there are often a combination of programming settings for the co@@ ders and these parameters . the manual or the help of the codi@@ les explain the switch for these programs .
for example , to add CD titles ; titles be added to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3s with l@@ ame are encoded with l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ set ; the result looks like this : &apos; -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ An ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in assist@@ ants ) :
this is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database , where people can read / enter the information , instead of charging the information instead of yourself in the calcul@@ ator . it &apos;s worth not@@ ing that here only the text is spoken : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names , etc . , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal but I ( CEO of the ure@@ ter ) I am not a lawyer . however , no one can fix it from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so can &apos;t be added to the artist nor the music business . any information can be received anyway on a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ader ; it is actively used to check the check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address will not be used when retri@@ ev@@ ing the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer that has checked the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ader ; when using Free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographic on the next mirror directory will be needed . this saves a bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of mirror servers for the online pick @-@ up of &amp; CD ; information during read a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) just the updates of the database .
which program is used to play pieces from the &amp; CD ; stored in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia would be used to read it in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed first if this is not done yet .
to store the read out WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer and thus the desired file format will be chosen . in the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) will be added to the Code tab on this tab . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the affected Linux distribution before the code is used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined code . further information on co@@ di@@ ers are found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , further information about his switch can be received by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . thereby &apos; l@@ ame &quot; must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check out the device number of &amp; CD ; / DVD disk , the write and reading right of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ lo@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc . ) , try to open both programs with a command line in a terminal . this might be something wrong .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the CD , and this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step for example . even if you are using other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , but are all understood , but are somehow still not sure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set out those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , print everything and use our first &amp; CD . we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled package for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd contains and that you have scre@@ aming to copy it ( eg ; by trying to copy it up with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ An ; something that is probably only done once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each read &amp; CD .
here we determine the use of the coding of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set Extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) , where the files are used , we share the program using the Free@@ DB file to load the files from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them with any reading &amp; CD , once the matching settings are found .
the device name is given to the reading program that can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the true device of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt on the existing entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the box card General Settings . here are not much to do . here , an additional conversion will be defined . in our example everything is so off@@ setting / typ@@ ed as shown in the screenshot .
only in case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed if data are sent to the creation of keywords ( tags ) .
the CD card settings . simply select both entries , we are convenient and let the &amp; CD be downloaded automatically over the Internet from a Free@@ DB machine .
note : the machine must be connected to the Free@@ DB server using the internet , so it can be connected to the Free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , becomes an &amp; CD ; associated entry begins immediately the reading name / name . this is slightly modified with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame file names and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; for day use .
apart from this example , if you want to manually enter all the select fields and Free@@ DB , you will be able to download it twice in Off@@ line mode . however , this is more than 620 MB in open mode . however , these have to be selected twice in the offline mode , at least the first one . mode will be set up on the following card map .
CD@@ DB is Free@@ DB for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the CD@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system know which data is to be received from the Free@@ DB server ? read the section on Free@@ DB . make sure it &apos;s shown in the screenshot above .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look after a mirror server in your area . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will however work as a first attempt .
both work as equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls require the protocol 88@@ 80 as standard , there might be more fortun@@ ate with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit any CD ; data to the Free@@ DB server . disable the first check box should be sufficient .
just take the settings from the screen saver . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously liter@@ ating pieces : exc@@ use , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? read and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore simply try .
CD ; after reading the last unit , cross it around the &amp; CD ; throw at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this one , then / or the path can be stored in which the WAV files are installed . this folder will not be enabled , if you do not want to do this folder when you want to do something with WAV files .
everything will be given as it is shown on the screenshot . the command is a bit long , under the circumstances something to be fli@@ pping over to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as already mentioned , the resulting bit@@ rate is sufficient for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
notice the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of creating tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &quot; id@@ 3 &apos; for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
keep the rest as shown in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
the number of WAV files simultaneously to be encoded with dual core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be attempted to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this section is described as described in the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , which is done on the hard disk , was developed in the previous section as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will be described . the process of data is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in Free@@ DB , screen photos will see a little different from the data base for one &amp; CD ; you will learn how to get data manually from the Internet . you will get the data manually from the Internet . comments will be shown on the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD now has to be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screenshot . this only if the &amp; CD can be identified as audio CD ; and from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia can be read .
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers about the help or go back to the previous section of the default settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD was picked up , all titles of the artist are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; gives a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best suited to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you don &apos;t have the check box for the automatic query by Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for Settings ) , you can manually trigger it manually from the choice of the first button , but you do not need local database , but you need access to the Internet .
e 1.2 @-@ step 02 : the CD editor - input of CD data and title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD , according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be given out more in the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments in a single piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful recall of the data from the Free@@ DB file , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album title , but also to check if there are any unwanted Rem@@ ar@@ ks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field . this option is allowed to set up the values of ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags ; this option will be shown at the Code of Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ Settings ; please refer to the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; .
you may change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all codes or file formats . see Help on the Ko@@ di@@ erer after receiving more information .
simply select an entry , obviously with the style of the trigger CD ; right . in this example , this is not important , since we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for further information go to the website of Fri@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Edit@@ ors appears again and you see that the fields are filled with the entered data , which we have already recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . add the title of the piece to any case and other information that you want .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered any title data on the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the Free@@ DB file . it is already sorted into one of these categories of database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown on the track list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the tracks which are selected will be selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the play , or manually select the box on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection out of the reading process was started , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and track what runs .
click on the tab on the tab on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will you see if you are trying to work with a coding which you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked the write access to the files for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first volume .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . to read out and en@@ code parallel . note the stat@@ s in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration possible to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only one that seems configur@@ able is the result of reading and code . with high @-@ performance machines , the result is un@@ clear . the used machine with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem while simultaneously reading and code ( from two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queu@@ e . after the last piece is codi@@ fied , a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ster ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . resp@@ . 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the coding of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ster ; is now able to report within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS , as part of the iconic media package . if you can do it with CVS , most distri@@ butions are already a pre@@ compiled package ; the most distri@@ butions are already included in your distribution . if you &apos;re reading this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is directed to individuals that are compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adjusted to your needs if it runs once , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . at best , read the step for step example to get to know the options and settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still read more ? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first @-@ time start of the program , without any clu@@ e to go from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of program start no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this hand@@ book . it is thought to be the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ster , may we do it . at least , if you read this , he has to leave this section and is therefore agreed with this suggestion .
strange when you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these sites , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it also has a real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke @-@ Ech@@ og@@ am@@ ination of text some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it is running on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also function . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound projector , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the pop @-@ up text on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphic display of the activity of any MIDI channel by emphasis of the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag and drag all MIDI file from a &amp; Account ; window to KM@@ id .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( rec@@ tan@@ gles or tex@@ tures ) . KM@@ id automatically calcul@@ ates the procedures used .
seat support . if you have &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song finish , KM@@ T starts next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select from the menu item . the usual file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also send a file from a &amp; Account window ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this will also work with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry game play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you drag it to &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played afterwards . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the left mouse button and drive with the controller and drive .
if you find that a song becomes too fast or slow down , you can click on the arrows to turn left and right of the speed display . to get back the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , then a pressure on the space bar or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu , interrup@@ ts the display . press the space bar while no play starts , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in a piece of music . some pieces use texture event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are supposed to be displayed , and even better : the Event order will need to set you nothing manually . if you select the entry Automatic text , you will always have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , select from the menu settings the entries of tex@@ tures and property rights . the same function also have keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summar@@ ize in . these will be the series that you can use in this section as you can use collections .
to create a collection , open the collection manager first . please click on the menu item under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included at the beginning the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the most wish in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to no other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . remember to add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it has to be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song from the button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the arrangement of automated addition to the collection .
if auto configuration is enabled , a piece of opening ( using file opening or Drag &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , it activ@@ ates the temporary collection when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series after sub@@ menu pop@@ s of the menu , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list above the Karaoke text .
to skip a song , select the button Next song , the next song from the menu item or push the arrow button right .
to return to the vice versa , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu or press the arrow to the left .
in order to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collecting collection , and click the button del@@ etion .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , however , this does not matter since leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not saved .
this is essential for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General @-@ MIDI . in this case , the MIDI map General MIDI @-@ MIDI events have been translated into events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , that trans@@ forms all the events of the Type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and will therefore always be heard a trumpet when playing a piano .
if you only have a sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including AW@@ E and G@@ US cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary sizes for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear as often as requested . pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for it is , however , that every occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A further Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ...
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so I can support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices which are not General @-@ MIDI files .
in this section , how the patches of General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard . general usage sees as follows :
note that the left side of the equal mark is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you cannot change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that are needed to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , which sounds similar to a tissue . this includes the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( R@@ ile supplement ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and play the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum @-@ patch the patch is meant , with that every sound represents a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ acas &amp; etc . ) and not the one with which the sound is the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to display like sounds on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section is the order of lines very important , as its presence . you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ boards are mainly used to map tones on the perc@@ us@@ sions channel . take a look at the provided Key@@ boards .
this section may be used to map some channels to others . if you want to swap the first and the second channel , simply make it to the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you are using the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map option has to be defined further in the file ! if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all the events will be ignored the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for instance to always use the perc@@ us@@ sions Patch on the Per@@ kus@@ hima channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio , in which ratio Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events are multiplied with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then forward . the value 40@@ 96 is used to do so in the map file no dec@@ imal com@@ mas ) .
this setting is needed because GM provides that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch in pitch with the value 40@@ 96 . unfortunately , some key@@ boards should be playing higher up to one oct@@ ave . to get the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use an MIDI map , simply open the dialog box MIDI settings . please refer to the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the canal view is a window with a number of Kla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this keyboard you can see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel you have a select list where you have changed one instrument , the button does not give green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to view the played tones . view the menu settings under the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed , which a song is played , the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about it as a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file may lead to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the single instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support was compiled . to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example , by k@@ mid ; &apos; s home )
I &apos;d like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no pleasure to add all files individually .
hereby , this supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them onto &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
in advance , enable the Automatic Add to Collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow button on the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD .
I clicked on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop , if I want to play an MIDI file ( if I want to play an kar@@ aoke file ) or I want to play a file , only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window changing and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; pull .
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them directly to a collection , turn the automatic settings to the collection , and the new file will be added to the temporary collection . open files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you just want to play the first file . so you will make the settings automatic Add to the collection and open .@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then join to also play B.@@ C and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , I anim@@ ate me , continue to program &amp; k@@ mid ;
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . in the moment I &apos;m not working for my hob@@ bies , but I am trying to take some time for my hob@@ bies . as Hob@@ bies have I wanted to collect MIDI files , make music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to download where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension by &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ va @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really can send me a postcard from your residence or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me by friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; however , you should contact me whenever I might have a MIDI file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; fully written in my spare time and not from anyone &apos;s money . I would like to emphas@@ ize it because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the bug that the pitch in AW@@ E @-@ cards was too high .

and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians in the network which give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also available on its homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ R@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ Ther@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can see the development and look at images . they also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external thesizer , because the sound quality depends greatly on your sound card . it is not the same whether you are using a FM radio or AW@@ E card .
if you do not have sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ D@@ EM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VI@@ SU@@ AL . it &apos;s going as if you couldn &apos;t hear a sound card except that you couldn &apos;t hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , and to play DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet completed as &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer was installed .
for additional help please check the website The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . and finally there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only appear when displaying information on it .
it is possible to en@@ rich the preferred links below the menu , but these are individual entries . if you are playing a list of entries you should use the category of permanent playlist .
of course you can add groups to groups to see an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you choose one entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the r@@ end@@ ition begins with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous playlist , can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player , but also by the application itself . just click on a name for a category . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is shown .
after changing XML files , you have to select the playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select a different category .
all alter@@ ations are lost when processing mode is abandoned or selected a group without using the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation of starting and ending can be disabled by editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and Modi@@ fied by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / ms@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at start doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate by opening a different source . this would dis@@ rup@@ ture the end @-@ animation however , the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ up can be a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; Body : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif : / lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / ; in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size from the network and other things .
another tool for troub@@ les@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this r@@ end@@ ition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c , such as a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; you can even insert the special box Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages it is necessary to specify the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash .
the Con@@ quer@@ or &amp; Multi@@ player ; is to be used in a consoles application and to search for error messages related to loading of the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
in order to always use a pre @-@ established back@@ end for a particular M@@ ime Type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual alter@@ ing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , ph@@ on@@ on plays all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV maps , either via M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , you need to manually edit the device and the TV channels . in addition , the scanner can be edited from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog in the col@@ m@@ player is to use the dialog in Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be found ( eg . it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB @-@ ROM .
since the V@@ DR support for cra@@ m@@ player only X@@ Video can work , X@@ video should also work ( probably this kind of playing of video devices under Linux the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension is needed for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 Server has to be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally , from KM@@ Player is used for the sources different names . at the time of the origin of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ 3d source , dv@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , pre@@ source source , v@@ source source and v@@ dr@@ source . when they are activated , they start playing the playlist .
there is evidence how to make my CD@@ ROM drive can be qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is run as user root after joining the device . doing sure that / dev / c@@ drom will be showing on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ins start only slowly , why does my CPU have to be tested for its performance every time ?
note : the answer is out@@ hol@@ es@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the last saved value , only the first time will examine x@@ ine the CPU .

QT ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; tile ;
latex ; : a professional application application . among Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be taken back on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD / DVD is needed .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled package of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distributors , these allow simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are on the k@@ ile ; website included .
this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; latex ; &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; &amp; Linux ; or Linux ; .
advanced users can hardly read this hand@@ book . however , all suggestions are needed for documentation . if the support is requested for this project or documentation , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; website .
any questions about or at the compilation of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or you want extensions , this should be addressed at the Mail@@ ing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

for more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to find out should be drawn to Kate . users from &amp; k@@ ile ; you can start directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the Editor &amp; Kate .
for natural &amp; latex ; the right out@@ ings : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . however , it is difficult to use , an av@@ ie ( engl@@ ish@@ lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic argument is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just like other identification languages include &amp; latex ; an Introduction to set out the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text data with the command \ \ &apos; begin { document } and must be taken back with the command \ \ &apos; { document } .
the fast @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is an important function for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu item ) provides some examples to create document related settings .
document classes : this describes the type of document generated by the document : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; PDF &#93; , report &#91; DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ p@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scan &#93; , projector &#91; We@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : this is set to set the character encoding . it should use the character de@@ coding of the system . modern systems increasingly use the UTF @-@ 8 encoding as default . at best , UTF @-@ 8x should be checked ( for proper processing of &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most frequently used pack@@ ets for latex ; for the integration them can only be selected in the check box .
( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) , document classes of comp@@ a @-@ Script ( for the observ@@ ance of German DIN regulations ) . you should always use the compilation of German texts .
new users can now no worry about this . it is just a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the emphasis of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable one ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; you should read it with the modest appearance of the output file however . however , you will be saved by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will save time and anger .
with the automatic transmission of the environments is created by typ@@ ing a new command ( e.g. \ \ advised { command } ) from &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically created a blank line ( for input text ) and the associated entry ( e.g. \ \ c@@ end { command } ) . this function can be set off within the menu settings ; La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; encourage the document in the following elements ( part is the most powerful and sub@@ mitt@@ ing the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structural view the individual elements can be viewed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective image .
in creating your own &amp; latex ; -@@ files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; Minor file &#93; has been created , ski@@ ps &amp; k@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contained a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to the PDF font collection type &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for view , transformation and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
for the use of the R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ts@@ i @-@ file the elements of the DVI ; file was clicked on a link in the DVI ; file is clicked on the exact opposite . once upon a section in the &amp; latex ; source code was clicked on , the corresponding spot is done in DVI ; viewer .
Master @-@ document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with others . in the use of a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set with project settings .
quick @-@ growing : the source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless an error in the source code is provided ) .
file data : in this mode the DVI ; file is located on the n@@ avy , and there is no appeal of &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; after the quick assembly .
in case of editing the edit tool bar , the three large selection criteria should be found in the document . the selection box is for the fast link of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; Ds ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the sel@@ ector further may be included in the menu of articles such as keywords , joints , or references . these are available :
name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or other element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified name ( selection for a selection field is available ) .
when using Qu@@ ot@@ ation a selection list will be displayed with literary entries . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary only if the file is related to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ tex ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ b@@ tex ; files are written by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¼ m is used for the definition of the font . it can be specified for the main text that can be set up , etc . the following documents are available :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two sel@@ ections are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and st@@ acking settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason .
the brackets for the command \ \ &apos; s class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font set . if the font is not set at the beginning , it can also be done in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; latex ; the sim@@ pl@@ est way for this is the sim@@ pl@@ est way for building construction or the button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
set the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be searched in the logging after the errors . when using fast @-@ making &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; this is not the case , it should also be considered for logging .
a environment ( English . environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font can have been created . the command \ \ advised { &apos; } , \ \ &apos; and \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; and \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; and \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; and \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; s .
the given changes are c@@ auti@@ ous only within the environment ( \ \ &apos; \ &apos; environment } to \ \ &apos; { environment } ) . there is no coating ( number ) for the possible modifications within one environment .
there are many opportunities to maintain the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , you can add certain fonts , fat pressure , cur@@ ricul@@ um , sub@@ str@@ ations , etc . these commands can be sent either by command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ advised { h@@ h } : this command is available for the cur@@ ative pressure and is as long as possible until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed in a sub@@ folder with \ \ sen@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quot@@ ation starts with \ \ advised { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language is now displayed , follows a step @-@ step instructions for the creation of a document in &amp; c@@ ile ; .
as soon as the wiz@@ ard has been inspired a bit of text , a few adap@@ t@@ ability to the better read of the document should be done . at this , a quote , a few spots in fat and ital@@ ic print and an art work should be applied to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , you can return to the editor by Editor @-@ View or Str@@ g E ( internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , its window must be closed .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or changed into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and play fun .
DVI ; it is a device file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ nings ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Ds ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .@@ d@@ vi edition such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conversion or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as you want to create a document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can print out ( if the printer is properly configured ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the transformation of DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; latex ; source code was created , the conversion is able to start in different formats by the b@@ FE in the tool@@ bar .
for previous search , you can encourage the direct jump from the Editor to the requested location within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setup for all &amp; latex ; -@@ binary files . for this purpose only Modern under settings must set up ... tools to be washed .
to filter out the advance search , the mouse po@@ inter must be clicked on a line of the source code and attached to advance search . the jump to the corresponding point in DVI ; -@@ viewer is done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; document &amp; c@@ ile ; one must set &amp; c@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; set up in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; set up as text editor ( set up ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ... Editor )
if using quick assembly of the &amp; DVI ; viewer cannot reach the viewer , there may be an error , it should display a mistake , so it is displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the protocol file will be added to the source code in the source code . in the editor you can read the pop @-@ down list between errors . log files must always be clicked on the error in the logging , and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to incorrect line .
once click on the button in the tool bar , a window will appear to choose the template for the document . the default values are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can be written for either the reason or the assistant for the quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section .
frequent user of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be generated in &amp; c@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you need to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file can be created or created a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template to create an existing document and create files from document ....
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some string disks are replaced by other data ( e.g. Name or character encoding ) . these variables can set to set up settings in settings .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which string matches are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ : this string is subst@@ it@@ uted by entering the document class . typically they will be used for example : \ \ &apos; s class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the related commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have been performed :
when creating a new document , the template may be selected instead of the standard material .
a template can be created from any type of latex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template should be searched in the Internet and described in the steps below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a editor for program@@ mers of reading and approach of many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for the menus made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; available .
to learn more about Kate and Kate ; and its services should be attracted to Kate . users from &amp; k@@ ile ; users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start right there by reading &amp; Kate &apos;s work with the Editor &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; latex ; command line reference which can be called for the use of the La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can find out a useful description of almost all commands that are used in &amp; latex ; use can be used as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with an outside C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way , only \ \ par \ \ \ will be selected to \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when drawing the text with an outside left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using arrow keys with dr@@ unk@@ y surrounding seal , you can get selected parts of the source code inside the editor .
&amp; Un@@ ile ; has the ability to browse and emphas@@ ize the different types of source texts . for example , the &amp; latex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas can be highlighted by another color .
many Assist@@ ants can be cons@@ ulted in this text . this will be an own type of bookmark within the text . this will also emphas@@ ize the jump to the oldest or last jumping stamps . this is also emphas@@ ized by the first typ@@ ing of a character .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using an program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already excellent services have been added ; &amp; Ds ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; latex ; special commands for their selection . under the editing pane the following commands are included :
had a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph , it is not included in any text with all other rows of the source code . the only sub@@ tly thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is there@@ with that the default value is separated by two blank lines .
scales the word under the current cur@@ ry position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also has &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a R@@ Ã ¼ inch me@@ ar ( \ \ ) and a real star ( * ) at the end .
for a part of a part of this document , Nat@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ently can remove them from this first and can be removed by pressing the key . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own commands to provide a faster result . below editing are the following commands to do the text contained :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to editing outside paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; for that reason , &amp; c@@ ile ; for many more commands under the editing environment for a simple simple work with &amp; latex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the order to open the surrounding area .
with this command to jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the order to close the surrounding area .
when the cursor is located before or within the command \ \ &apos; s { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many aff@@ ord@@ ed ambient commands can quickly be lost sight . this command conclu@@ des the most recently populated environment , so that the ne@@ sted environmental structure is not ar@@ sen@@ ed .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; -@@ groups , which are intended by bra@@ ces { ... } . under the Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that follow the editing environment .
this command is used at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the hal@@ ted cl@@ amps .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the mounting bracket .
when the cursor is placed before or behind the hal@@ ting bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # is bound to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
at the input of many smoo@@ th@@ ed groups @-@ brackets you can quickly lose the view of the most recently opened group , so that the sealed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not gro@@ omed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple origins are used in &amp; c@@ ile ; for the appropriate submission occurs in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple origins . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two close beginner or latex ; one .
this automated quality mark can set up using the K@@ ile Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be introduced and sign@@ posted .
it can also be used for user @-@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ b or French ) and can be used for German or French beginners . there are also many other languages available .
when set up for Shift ; to@@ ast &amp; c@@ ile ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located within a list of lists ( e. g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , not only a line breaks , but also the \ \ item command .
within the tables environment , &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ is \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ line bi@@ ased &amp; latex ; - or set custom environments under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
some users can arrange the columns in tables environment and thereby all t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; tries to encourage them . while this t@@ ulator is not the added t@@ abo@@ o in the most common tab . in case this t@@ ulator is not allowed to add , for some spaces for the column positions of the current tab .
though &amp; Kate . already a good source code for this purpose , it was built in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually for use &amp; latex ; ) and the other two are available for automatic pro@@ positions . all these modes can be set up for different working methods for different working conditions .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ &apos; s { environment } the &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically introduces the command \ \ &apos; environment } on an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the button , the last letter of the input is removed and can be gr@@ ati@@ fied by the comparison list . on the other hand the list can also be smaller by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , Nat@@ Ã ¼ r@@ lich will be removed when selecting a command . alternatively , you can easily jump to these positions via edit hi@@ de@@ marks hi@@ ves , and the parameters can be collected then .
set up under settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; All different W@@ ages are made for these lists . these can be selected different W@@ alls for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; Ds ; commands as well as to the general language of the language .
the command mode is not intended for the processing of environments . it will always be input a few letters with \ \ &apos; advised . on the other hand , the environment will be used as often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for setting up the environments for processing .
when calling the processing mode , the menu Edit Alt + Shift key / key space is automatically collected and the command will be automatically collected and it appears \ \ advised . afterwards , the environment can be continued in the sim@@ pl@@ est way and can be completed by pressing the input key .
after this is done , the environment will automatically shut down again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; realize that it is a layer environment , even a first \ \ item command is provided .
set up under settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; All settings are made to these lists . this mode uses the list of view list for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; Ds ; -@@ commands .
&amp; C@@ ile ; under@@ lined custom lists of dra@@ fts , which are immediately replaced by l@@ Ã ¼ n@@ avi@@ est strings . the lists can be set up for the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the file contains the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l which is part of the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L is entered , and the word @-@ processing mode has been introduced to the processing or the key processing C@@ trl + Alt Emp@@ ty , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
a large number of people are not helpful for automatic processing . however , it was found that many people can be written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the completion of all written author@@ ization exists .
this mode can set up in the menu settings of K@@ ile ... Turn off valves . here , the swelling can also be specified for displaying the installation .
the sub@@ folder files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / Complete / mode / the personal Home folder . mode is suitable for sampling ( query ) , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ book ) or tex .
the dialog graphics can be edited from graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphic formats , the sections should be considered and respected .
PS -@@ files are not as known as PDF files , but we provide an excellent basis for the modifications and new orders of pages . will the PDF output be ordered , so can the pages be ordered with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools are re@@ arranged and then be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to be able to consider the result of the work , you need to comp@@ ile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the menus creation , creating and creating comp@@ utation .
for the comp@@ iling of the source panel for the viewer , such as &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the additional transformation can be used by keys ; it may be used by the key ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file by pressing Alt + 5 the PS @-@ file .
when using the Quick Delivery command , a viewer is usually called after the comp@@ iling . should not be used as a built @-@ in viewer , each new window will be opened every time .
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... The following information is asked for the project :

&amp; gt ; it is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . using the command @-@ line interface you can create random signature or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs like &amp; K@@ Mail ; .
for random signatures a signature from the signature file by &amp; k@@ sig is read . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information you can create your e @-@ mail varied and unique .
for a day signature will be read the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . for every day you use different signatures , as with the random signature you create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this gives you an empty signature ; click on the signatures ; insert it with C@@ trl ; S file Save or click the disk symbol Save .
you can create multiple signatures at any time . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; K@@ Mail ; whether you are interested in e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it from the menu File or click on the icon with the red cross removal in tool@@ bar .
open the mode of current commands . here you can select Sh@@ un@@ commands for menu entries , select an action from the list . then click the button on the button 1 and enter the new button im@@ press by pressing the button or key combination .
for the use of &amp; k@@ eting ; &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 is required . to attach Sig@@ nat@@ ures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; K@@ Mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command .

the plug@@ ins , the &amp; quantum l@@ us ; assist you have with &amp; quantum ag@@ l@@ us ; you may benefit from the additional functionality immediately and don &apos;t have to wait until someone can use the Ge@@ unwanted in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ us ; you can use the plug@@ ins in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used further below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start with the menu plug@@ ins . this follows the following dialog :
this dialog enables you to manage and add all of the contained plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; item inside :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location , &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; this path is used for searching the plug@@ ins .
often working on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship one . &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties @-@ Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for the unique identi@@ fier .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leader and sub@@ project leader .
the user can select himself from the list of members of the team who is . this happens by pressing the team member from the list and press S@@ etz@@ e button . the currently selected member ( its identification ) appears bold after which you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of their own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see comments for further information .
apart from an overview of your team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be created an event to information on the team manager if something specific happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions taken out when something specific is done in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that a file would be saved , or a script that plays a file into CVS , once they are added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the S@@ HI@@ FT , F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the address selected in the receiver list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project manager . see , we@@ i can be set up such ladder .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from ordinary comments through the following things :
note : it is easy to select comments from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by note text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the name @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is the role in the project : team leader Sub@@ project leader Sub@@ project leader In the area of the Sub@@ project Sub@@ project leaders , such as in the following examples , should be given below .
nick@@ name and wheels names are independent of large or small writing , but spaces around the cl@@ amps and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting languages that supports DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up by means of Settings . this dialog runs over some pages that will be treated succ@@ essi@@ vely .
the behaviour of &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; concerning tags including car sales can be changed . the entries are :
large / small t@@ sp@@ elling of tags : large / small description of automatically inserted tags . normal wholesale / to@@ elling means that tags are described as described in the everyday XML files .
large / small description of attributes : large / sub@@ sp@@ elling of automatically inserted attributes . normal large / small write means that attributes are inserted as described in the everyday XML files .
optional tags : if checked , the tag is optional , for which the closing tag is optional , it will be inserted immediately after the &amp; gt ;
not optional tags : how top for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and closing tag automatically update : if enabled , the closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic acquisition of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ent characters into the appropriate encoding during ti@@ pping .
M@@ IME types : mim@@ ing types to identify different types of files . by using button standard , the default enco@@ res can be restored .
default _ encoding : the encoding of newly created or in another mode when opened file open files ( where the encoding of the file may be addressed ) , but this setting is drawn from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is drawn from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; builds regularly backup copies , so that with a black@@ out or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for even stored documents a backup will be created regularly according to the time created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or its own view ( or documentation in a box rider , as it makes it possible to preview the documentation , the preview and source code simultaneously .
set the window settings back to the next start when the user interface has come through the changing of the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / hin@@ ge views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ rack command line parameter .
the warning message area is able to control the war@@ nings of war@@ nings from any or more information .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set to display symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the picture of the Par@@ ser node in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking the structure tree with the mouse button .
in the area of structural tree @-@ settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the updating of the tree in the tree , is to be stopped automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text while empty groups are such an element when found in the current document .
the area to set ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) , which are un@@ folded in editing to extensive text can be divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; this means that the if@@ er ab@@ brevi@@ ation is something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug@@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are used by third parties , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , in the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug@@ in , the following must be stated :
address : the path to plug @-@ in , if it does not lie at a standard location such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be given to the plug@@ in as a plug @-@ in , so it can open the current file , the associated file ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in is ref@@ using . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to load if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then tests &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the plug @-@ in is not properly available , if the plug @-@ in at the moment is not available , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; since version 3.3 , the les@@ hooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the not necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP . ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was implemented as well as the support for d@@ b@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug@@ in available which provides support for the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ vari@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ts .
the use of a de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of an appropriate de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in . with the Options button in addition to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in selection box the specific settings may be changed .
if a Deb@@ ug@@ ger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view that will display the content of monitored variables is usually in the left dock .
a view in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appear in the lower dock .
a view that shows the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
all or part of the following functionality is available depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger .
this action is required for de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ tag . this action is triggered by default when a de@@ bu@@ gger is used , so that a de@@ bu@@ gger is normally required .
the counter@@ part at Deb@@ ug@@ gle session opens the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or end the listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script and to send out information on the monitored variables as well as the current running line . if this happens while the script is stopped , it will start before a debit requirement has started , the script starts with the requirement .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script , without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution proceeds as soon as a request has been made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger runs the next statement in the script , without entering the functions or as a guide .
the de@@ bu@@ gger runs the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and includes that it will be broken .
if the de@@ bu@@ gger sends to ignore the order and go to the next one , then there would be no current .
open a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered that is monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog box can be entered with a variable or a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can customize &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; you can adapt to your needs and how you can &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to get better .
document type E@@ diti@@ ves packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages ; their simplicity and flexibility makes it possible . your simplicity and flexibility are made from &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; DT@@ EP ; s are handy , symbolic meaning of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions more quickly into a document , than a user ever .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be suspended ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see also for details .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define the specific attributes of tags and the Layout and content of the properties dialog . the file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; self . tool@@ bars allow rapid inser@@ tion of tags in a document without a risk of writing .
tag folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the descri@@ bing language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML on and de@@ declare whether they are necessary , or not . although it is not necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many users as possible , so that other users have a better view and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and borders will be explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only contain once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but it doesn &apos;t contain anything but only element type yourself .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; An argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the seminar category . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . specifies the name of the class to where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element @-@ element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this item can only be specified once for each attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that will describe how this attribute is to be indicated &amp; etc ; This is an only element type element .
specifies the source code used for the attributes in the tag editing dialog and attribute tree to the attributes .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology is within &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; it is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method@@ ology name . the arguments given to the method . may be blank or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container tag allows group@@ ing elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an only element type element .
specifies the location of the attribute of a tags in a dialog . this day can occur only once in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in a dialog box ( e.g. one for each box ; att@@ r &gt; &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ ing tags . this element is a just element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is a just element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with an &amp; XML format : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing but look out &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not result in , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools Dialog is Job &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; select Window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialogue will appear , whose simple instructions is to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , check only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following example , for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example , an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP file is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is to be the load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &apos; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; string _ name = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file ; file is as quite simple and there is an editor that can be att@@ ain@@ able via DT@@ D @-@ based DT@@ D ; this can be processed using a list of DT@@ D ; a simple &amp; DT@@ EP ; it should be done with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Con@@ fusion 1 for &amp; Qu@@ ag@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings ... created . click New action leads to the same dialog :
this action assigned to a short@@ cut . with clicking the button 1 button a short@@ cut can be assigned , with the one is removed the current short@@ cut .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and inserted in the execution of the action , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see Example below .
this is the most powerful part of the action . with the help of this action we can change external applications ( usually scripts but it is not limited ) that the document may change or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , such are the quick@@ start -@@ dialog , or the different view into ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EPs .
first you have to see the name of the script and interpre@@ ter . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % script@@ ase variable in the command line , such as sh % script@@ ase / Quant@@ a / scripts / Quant@@ a / scripts / Quant@@ a / scripts / Quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There is another variable variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we will replace the URL of the current document . within the case of a local documentary file , file is removed from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced by the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; process is replaced . if by &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text will be used to control the P@@ ID number ; this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used by the external script .
the parameter for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script inter@@ sect of &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ l@@ us ; to accept the default input . in the sel@@ ector input can be specified , what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
in accordance with the input , the output of the printed application can also be changed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output . it can be specified , by default the default output is set by default :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . in given case it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . choose Settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press release mode at the bottom of the window to edit the edit mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool@@ bar day .
complete everything and , if the day attributes has and you are planning , activate the &quot; Day &quot; dialog , if available , to ensure input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ ou@@ itt ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we will replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , Graph@@ ic Other Programs ( or where else is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select processing others .
please note that the created symbol no only helps you to mem@@ ori@@ ze what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
regarding the beginning of the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be displayed ; it is starting to insert a message ; -@@ tag in the current document is displayed .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this is done over the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm it with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so it still gives , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to complete some usual &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; features for tool@@ bar , or it should set them for better overview through some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . open the tool bar settings on Settings tool bar . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after the selection of the element , which is to be added to the tool bar , press the arrow button right . this adds the tool@@ bar element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to preview for example a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or . I will select it and add to tool@@ bar .
please note that as the separ@@ ator does not support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the Start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by typ@@ ing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
backup in the right folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct folder , but your tool bar should be loaded in the correct folder . please adjust their tool@@ bar ( s ) when a file is opened from the corresponding folder .
perhaps the most mentioned extension of &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility of adding documentation to the script language or the form@@ atting language you like to like . that &apos;s why this chapter explains how I create a &amp; PHP script tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could verify your own documentation ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if anyone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we &apos;ll need to leave the first part of it , and we will cover the second part here .

the section tree defines the visible aspect of the documentation in the document tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP documentation ; documentation such as something :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Introduction = com@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for chess stages ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out yourself .
you note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced to a file ( and is consistent at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders will be displayed ! ) .
blan@@ ks influence no , but watch out &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; web @-@ based &amp; quantitative .
the section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file used for designing the context @-@ sensitive help . for instance , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation is displayed directly for the m@@ ys@@ ql _ fet@@ ch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connecting lines .
a simple list of dot@@ ted separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file doc@@ r@@ c and save it to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Quant@@ a / doc / doc / Quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ LE@@ R / share / rip / Quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / rip / Quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / rip / Quant@@ a / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / Quant@@ a / doc / .@@ copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that this well and it value are to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files by using the &amp; quantum l@@ us ; -@@ repository for the use by the &amp; quantum l@@ us ; Community . they will not be rich , but are proud to be involved in the best web development platform .
&amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ator resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise to whom . in different places there is an email sending menu , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users can download . the contributions are checked and only useful for publishing the resources for which there is a GP@@ G / PGP key for which it is warran@@ ted , both for our team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you may have multiple keys . in the dialog with New Resource , you can fill in a dialog box ( URL preview can be empty ) and with clicking on OK you need to start up@@ loading .
the Upload is up@@ loading from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) , tool@@ bars , and folders from templates and folders in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource before installing the resource before the installation , it exam@@ ines &amp; qu@@ anti@@ fication . in case of problems , it war@@ ns and then it can be cancel@@ ed . please note the warning al@@ erts carefully . if the integrity and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the author of the author of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not currently created by &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; it can be time consuming , however , because hundreds of tag files may be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is the simpler way to automatically convert DT@@ D to a DT@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the Menu DT@@ D Download and Con@@ vert an DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that is to be used . after that the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type definition line : the string defined in ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / or htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / web@@ type
fine adjustment of the DT@@ EP after the conversion : if activated , brings &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; based on the conversion the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are several key concepts . in order to understand this and benefit from these fundamental concepts , one must first introduce them to these fundamental concepts without their understanding &amp; quantum ag@@ us ; little benefit .
in &amp; quantum ag@@ us ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ static ; uses , available . of tool@@ bars over actions , everything is marked as global , in the common order structure of &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators to secure actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development funds for a single user . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that this user can use only this user .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a certain project . this can be all done by &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns can be applied to the files of a certain project . simply said this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which means the use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the construction views , the bo@@ ilers , and the tool bar . please beat in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close to the current , other or all the cards , re@@ charging , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click on the Edit@@ or@@ range lead to another context menu on the processed document content , such as basic ed@@ ging steps ( copy / copy / paste ) , working under the mouse po@@ inter or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor .
at the upper end of the Edit@@ or@@ window , the tool@@ bars of the editors are currently shown ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars will be shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ l@@ us ; the tool bar will be adapted to the new functions and thus adapted user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if it is a simple day , for example &amp; lt ; you can enter the tag that the day is represented , then you can fill out the data for this just inserted day . should you fill out a day that has several attributes ( as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields .
the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allows you to open and navigate in the information about &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ l@@ us ; to navigate it , open them . in the display with competition , documentation , scripts , attributes and documentation is available .
project management is a powerful tool which provides &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided . this view shows all files in the project and allows the ste@@ ward of files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing up@@ loading , or del@@ etion of files from storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost anything can be a template : images , program parts , entire website &amp; etc . There are all possibilities available to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending upon which context it is used . the category is always available , local templates are available only for the relevant users and templates in projects only in the project . more on templates can be found in the project .
here you will find information on the available scripts . the concept of incorpor@@ ation in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information about a script . via the right button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send with email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking an element the cursor is placed on the position of the element . by law @-@ clicking an element it opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree .
this tree appears among other construction views . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the alter@@ ation of all available attributes can be changed with few mouse clicks .
here is the full documentation for web technology to find . it can download documentation for &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; you can easily create documentation ; and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ l@@ us ; two flash@@ cards at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the mess@@ aging window and the problem window .
this competition is showing information on each script running in Quant@@ a . for example the current DT@@ D of current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this competition is showing all errors in mark@@ up of current document . &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that will run out will give all error messages ( so that indicates ) in this window .
&amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bar are extensively restored and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate bars of the tool bar is the possibility of defin@@ ing your own commands than symbols in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; K@@ Mail ; if they can secure a tool bar in an email , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ us ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable when you want to adjust the location of &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; for this auto@@ conf gives a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you are having problems with start &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check that your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am folder also . you should also make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for a fast web development and combined a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; Qu@@ ag@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious , extended mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him absolutely the greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; now widely used on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this should be the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned claim must be noted that &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ ours is not only this possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quantum ag@@ l@@ us ; to expand how they need it for their needs .
&amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; allows web development to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can expand productivity almost every task . by using the program comp@@ ose , it can be qu@@ anti@@ fied by the program comp@@ ress . ( more details can be found here . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is related with help : / Quant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or run hel@@ p@@ center help : / Quant@@ a ) .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; is currently being developed and super@@ vised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ el @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
quick download list of files you have opened . this list will change every time you open a file , which is not located on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you want to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; sp@@ elling , so it is displayed correctly and can not be understood by the browser as form@@ atting .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is used primarily for inser@@ tion &amp; URL . s in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key ;
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP script is error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or used with GUI and pre @-@ defined phr@@ ases to help you .
displays the message window . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
- and activ@@ ating the problem of problem at the lower edge of the &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ l@@ us ; main window is activated , once you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbolic links from the main window . this column allows you to place book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries pre@@ previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents are group@@ ed by the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ l@@ us ; projects are saved with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables you to copy graphics files into your project folders or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
defined settings like &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project maintains . in the chapter &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find details .
downloads a project tool@@ bar . they are stored in Project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the tool bar type : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool bar . created only the name . actions must be saved by means of Settings ... or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars using tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not del@@ etes it from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you would like to do so .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe due to the tool@@ bar in the next release ) . the menu item opens up a new email message with the tool bar as an app@@ endix .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , wherever anyone can access it . see .
upload an &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; own exten@@ der format .
upload / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it is useful if the entities from the &amp; DT@@ EP will fail , without renew the whole &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this is global , and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder fails to fail .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu default in the tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day of settings when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this means only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent add means that , using tool@@ bar , this will contra@@ dict the rules by means of tool@@ bar .
in the plug@@ ins Menu the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the menu @-@ listed menus . click it to disable a activated plug@@ ins .
choose the syn@@ op@@ lan@@ ce mode for the current file . the list of available approach is based on der@@ k@@ ate ; version from now on .
select the type of line identification . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by using the external application T@@ id@@ y .
immediate change between the different kinds of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switching can sometimes need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the cartridge mode , or the default mode , which is displayed in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ static ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open window . selecting an input will be activated for the sub@@ window .
to@@ g@@ gles the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
the changes in this dialog influence any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser being used .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor . you &apos;ll find details in the Edit@@ or@@ window .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool bar , or add what can modify and follow the sequences .
this should produce a help according to the sphere of the mouse button , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free to use , but as with any open source project , developers may always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quantum d@@ us ; development in financial form shall find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed by the top of the project called the entire directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be completed by Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example , fo@@ o . when typ@@ ing Name , file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; quantum d@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case letters and without spaces using web@@ pr@@ j ( e.@@ f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here are the server address of the machine , which one wants to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ Example ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0.@@ 1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocols are used . depending on the remote machine , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default Templ@@ ates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be configured by the standard .
this is the folder where the tool bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be configured by the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem in the project . you can select multiple files or entire folder .
this setting is great if you have static content content you want to download and change . if you have static scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , py@@ thon , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is started ane@@ w , do not hook on .
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to my own .
this displays a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by cont@@ acting or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging from the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded to the menu with Project Properties in the menu Profile or with the Shift key ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ card possible ) , which are re@@ viewing for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
comple@@ mentary option to the above , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read in more than project views .
this allows you to select the required de@@ bu@@ gger . currently , just Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed is found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set with the Options dialog . in the event , the bug@@ ging will be described .
in the sub@@ window profile you can upload upload profiles ( see in ) as well as display a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , indicating your own design view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the sub@@ panel configuration , you can turn on event actions and add these actions , change or delete events . event actions will occur when a previously defined event happens , such as the viewing of a file . see the details below .
by default , &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not currently influence .
to open a project , select Project ... from the program Project or the Project Open from the tool@@ bar . the Project Open Project will open and allow the project selection . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the repository is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files you will find the same if you upload a new project .
project management gives free access to the files in the project . the files can be managed in the current project .
folder be@@ have as well , but are missing the entries opening and opened with the right mouse button :
different profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information about the place of high @-@ number files .
allows removing the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is blind@@ ed to prevent the removal .
the password will keep the disk space and remember when we are running . this option is useful if common up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk does not come to the question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; Autom@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many upload profiles can be uploaded to different servers with the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the Name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally this doesn &apos;t have to be changed , except the network administrator runs a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a haz@@ ard . the password will be saved on the plate , so it can not be read easily but everyone can easily see it in plain text .
one Project View is only one set of files and tool bar . it can be loaded in one project , i.e. by simple de@@ af of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened , opened , or deleted from the tool@@ bar , or the project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ques ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows modification of &amp; quantum ag@@ us ; to own working methods .
as already mentioned above , tool bar in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; best of tool@@ bars in the best of the menu . use and addition vary . the addition of tool@@ bars is handled in the section Add of tool@@ bars .
the tool bar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the tool can be changed , tool@@ bars or tool@@ bars can be set , which can be specified in the dialog box where actions are to be visible on those or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , entries will be added to the entries and actions that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up and set up actions in the menu with Settings tool bar .
templates are common document skel@@ et@@ ons , code car@@ vings and files for lin@@ king . &amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; they can copy , move or move into the system existing directory in the store space . templates have in &amp; quantum d@@ us ; in about the limitations you imagine to the file system .
some with &amp; Qu@@ ot@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is everything not pure text . it can be any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary lists are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are listed in the pre@@ amplifier tree under global templates .
documents can be written by any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , specif@@ ying documents can be found in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the sub@@ folder under global templates . see also for more information on templates .
this kind of template is useful , if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template , but the same text area will always be inserted in the documents . you can find all the examples below a complete menu system on jav@@ ascript or Perl . see for more information on templates .
as the name says , these templates are for whole web sites like templates . they are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure according to customers ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose file as template stores as local template ....
once this is done , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the Templ@@ ate is not visible in the repository . look under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As you save the selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply drag and drop to the tree view templates .
creating binary templates is simple : to copy the file only to a template folder . you can use all file management functions to be used , such as pulling and inser@@ ting or inser@@ ting over the file tree of kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click in the file tree or in the repository block man@@ view to a folder right click and secure site template to secure a name for the template and secure it . by default , it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global template .
project templates allow a very effective approach . you can insert header and foot@@ er or dynam@@ ically linked with &amp; PHP ; add files or link them to them . in addition , some things can be found very deep in the eye when using templates .
the template structure in the sub@@ menu templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Quant@@ a / templates / Quant@@ a / templates / Quant@@ a / templates / Quant@@ a / templates / Quant@@ a / template / templates .
to specify the behavior of an folder can be selected in the template list with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu features . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blind@@ ed , as soon as ter@@ restri@@ al attributes is ver@@ b .
this is enabled by default and fits all except for the master folders in the template . if a master folder would be set in this way , the B@@ lah would appear with something like plain text . if nothing appears , you will probably be found in a stem folder .
allows the preceding or displayed text for templates in this folder . this might be common header and foot@@ er for all templates for a particular project , allowing a whole presentation to equi@@ p an entire header with the matching head@@ line / foot@@ er .
additionally you have a context menu ( pointing to the right button menu ) using a full command collection for adding folders or copy and paste from one place to another .
&amp; Qu@@ anti@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be accessed via the menu View . the first mode is replacing the source code editor in two parts : the source code editor and V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor is as follows : he invites you to edit a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and install the source code as required in the V@@ PL ; editor visible in the source code .
working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ary of &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; code editor . there is no plans to modify this behavior .
the second mode is just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is active in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL , this mode is already active , trig@@ gering the active cursor itself from one window to another , where the position is kept in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor can be adjusted between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatic . in the option you can automatically select the time span . in principle , the duration of the time can be adjusted . a small range for fast machines and a large range for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags is possible , as soon as a new document is made with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL . this allows you to change the manual of the manual . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added by pushing the two buttons below or removed . one click into the list allows alter@@ ation of the content , e.g. keywords on the name and keyword key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of creating pages in browsers . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete . a change on the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template by pressing the file button and select the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is as written in a word processing , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor is acting as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing or remove back c@@ aste .
inser@@ ting tags is not done in the same way as the source code editor , such as in the source code editor , such as an anchor tag , which is inserted in the same way if a drop tag , surrounded with text , must be removed each other ambient air tag .
some tool bar like the tables assistant or lists assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used .

adds the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ D@@ GE ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ lt ; to the X@@ SL ambient variable . see also the documentation to the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
if the conversion is specified 20 times , the conversion is specified under two times , the conversion will be changed 100 times
the input documents are treated as HTML files if the support is enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml .
enable the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document , if the support is enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml . this is enabled by default .
on systems with installed Read@@ line library , you can scroll down with the arrow keys to / down from the previously printed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite prints as an argument . &amp; eg ; : using the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; set _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; set .
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template made by the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 up to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a completely qualified name as &quot; X@@ SL : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ ing . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain short why I wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program used by myself only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what was changed in these lines . and there was no indications in the places where perhaps only the rec@@ ir@@ radiation had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences in line and modifications to white characters . later , a lot of further useful functions were added .
if you would like to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and add it in one of the compar@@ ative windows .
function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ ative and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge will be fully supported if two people work independently in one piece of co@@ de and make changes to the same time . the original file ( the basis ) helps you to process the result . in this editor you can even edit the result . the screenshot shows three j@@ ell files during assembly :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the merge and merge complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder memory :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and en@@ ligh@@ test the possibilities of changing color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines distinguish only in a certain number of white characters , this can be seen at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no anger if any one changes the returns . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file varies . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can ease your typ@@ ing work by typ@@ ing only the file name of the first file . for example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 3 folder 1 folder 3 folder
the Open dialog allows manual ti@@ pping of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection over the file browser ( file ... ) or the selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you will not have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be conducted with two files .
through the button folders ... you can also select a folder , if you select a folder , if you select a file , for B and C , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other files .
if merge is crossed , the input field is active for the target and can be retri@@ eved . however , it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving .
the setup knob opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / merge tab .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board . in open dialogue you do not have to select files . you can simply connect the dialog with the break button .
you can also drag and place drag : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you need to figure out how similar to these functions , they would just need to copy , paste in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can easily copy , paste and compare the relevant sections .
note : now you can not extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the f@@ law of text is supported in a comparison window .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and insert text into another program as slic@@ ing and inser@@ tion ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text@@ window , the Info line contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( when the path to a file is too long , let the mouse see a while over the line . then a little help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ ferences we can change over the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , the default color is visible , the default color is different . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is very useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next paragraph ( merge ) good .
in addition to the text , the column is displayed . if differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . with some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( C / C + + Z. B. are only the relevant changes relevant for the processor and in a few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line that separates the text column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line file is activated , the line will be scored on broken lines .
the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has an Info line with the in@@ scription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Add Symbol &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains the automatic merge already contains lyrics , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jumping at the next / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ing windows are used , every difference is a conflict which must be solved manually at the same time .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown . ( this will also be visible a jump in the position in the windows . ) This group becomes highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left there is a black bar .
sometimes the automatic merge function or by manual editing is left no more in the group ; then it is shown in these lines of text &amp; lt ; no line appears in the box ; this text is neither shown in the final saved file , nor in a marking you might copy and somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; Con@@ duct flows ; however , in the clip@@ board , if you copy this text from the result window . carefully go with this function .
note : if selecting the sources ignore or ignor@@ ant C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navig@@ ates will mainly navigate with the image movements and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using in one of the windows , you can also use the keyboard section , side , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end . the F@@ si@@ can column next to the vertical image bar can also be used to navigate .
in the eye window you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the In@@ sert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and transfer mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the assembl@@ ing columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already explained in the section and explained the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / last difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Fig . / C@@ trl @-@ click ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ click ) to the next / previous conflict . therefore , all conflic@@ ting conflicts will continue to be considered conflict . therefore , between sol@@ utes and un@@ solved conflicts has to be distinguished .
to copy the marking in the clip@@ board , you must copy the copying button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this option is activated , you will automatically copy the clip@@ board . be careful with this option , however , as you could not over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line number are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors are using a line slot for \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use c@@ line slot for \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the line files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you can &apos;t use binary files .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be saved when moving and restored in the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a let@@ tering with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also represents the fonts with variable width to choose from , but they should not use it . )
when you tick this option , differences in ital@@ ics are displayed . if the selected script does not support this presentation , nothing happens .
systems with only 16 or 256 colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered power@@ fully . by these systems , the button pres@@ ets an odd color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator key . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator will be inserted .
if you press entering or return Return , the entry of the previous line will be automatically used for the next row .
when this option is enabled , each selection will be copied to the clip@@ board . then manually copy the clip@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection of the used operating system .
for the compar@@ isons of files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all the identical lines in the source files can be found . only during this first step , white characters may be ignored . in this step , white characters are ignored . also in merge , white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a file @-@ back@@ lash &apos; \ &apos; on the end of a line , but then files are displayed with different sizes in the side @-@ to @-@ side comparison only , though they are different with different sizes , but then they might be different . during assembly , this option must be disabled . this option is disabled .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis numbers and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
this option is disabled by default . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sively search for smaller differences . the option is activated by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly over very large files .
this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed , before the next un@@ solved conflict is ski@@ pped .
trig@@ gers all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if you are only using the functions of v@@ le A / B / C for all un@@ solved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the auto selection also ignore or ignore for C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the chapter to scanning , folders , and run a merge operation . look for details under documentation in the directory comparison and merge operation .
if a file is stored and an older version exists , then the original version is Suff@@ ix .@@ original attached . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without further f@@ use .
fits the language of user interface . change this option does not affect the current running program . you have to finish &amp; restart the current running program . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because language is set to control over the control center there . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activ@@ ates this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
using the sel@@ ector for co @-@ coding a short note , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files can be compared and merged with different coding .
when you have edited a file , you can define what encoding to store is to be used .
if you define anticip@@ ation commands , they might not work with your Code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only deal with 8 bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of output commands .
turn this off to refra@@ in from changes in white characters in text or review ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignor@@ ing or Ig@@ nor@@ ing C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are displayed . according to the selection of A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , C &amp; B &amp; lt ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C &amp; lt ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C &amp; lt ; C ; C ; C ; C ; C &amp; lt ; C ;
sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply open the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison window next side or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together . a simple click will lead to the merge file as default for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the file name again , then the name of the last used file is kept . )
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function for example , for removing distur@@ bing parts or to correct the recording .
when reading a file , it is assigned to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of this command file is used . the output of this command is only used for line function , which corresponds to exactly your requirements . each input line does have to have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when set @-@ up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it . however , the good news is that in most cases used as used or per@@ l .
use this procedure command for line input to convert the input header for input characters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ U \ \ 1 / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ \ . \ \ 1 into the replacement string . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with used , you might begin to understand it and might even like these regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line @-@ off . sed sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every match between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , thus somehow deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple constra@@ ints once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the ar@@ rays each other . for example :
instead of used , you can also use something else , e.g. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &quot; Ho@@ wever , in per@@ l a few details differently . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal processing processor are maintained for display and merge . further operations are only modified the data that the line @-@ line Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can be seen .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ up @-@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processors as input .
the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , text changes or differences , you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can customize the proposal before starting ,
... the merge can sim@@ ulate and sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulated changes , without performing it ,
... select selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to compar@@ ing and merge of individual files . you only need to open the folder on the command line or in the dialog .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no target folder has been given , it uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will not start automatically , not to merge the merge you need to select the appropriate menu entry , or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder you will inform a small message window about current progress . if you cancel the folder scanning , only the files will be listed that are compared to the time .
when the scanning process is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
every file and any folder found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions and open all sub@@ directories with which you can fold or fl@@ fold all the folder .
when you double click on a file , the file is launched and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail pane to the selected object . in such a case the merge action can not be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about the problems of this type again .
as you can see in the picture above , the colors A / B / C are used in red , green , yellow and black .
however , the color is identical with identical entries , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered as identical if their total content is the same . then , folders also have the same color . for folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colors of a sheet which is only green then yellow and later when it is old , turned red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copying to A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ts exist , the merge cannot be launched .
... A and B does not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ts exist , the merge cannot be launched .
the syn@@ cing mode is active if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folder have been specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ised . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical are : merged and the result can be stored in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after conver@@ merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
if two folders are merged and then select the new file instead of merge ( un@@ certain ) , then examined and disc@@ ard the newer file . if the files are different , but the same date appears as if such bugs might not be removed , the merge folder cannot be launched .
during assembly , a file is processed after the other hand . you state Status column is ready , and according to other messages , when the merge is completed , you should make a last review and see whether the status is working everywhere .
if set @-@ in dialog the file comparison method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these include the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white clas@@ ps . ( the column for dissolved conflicts will only be shown if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can merge either the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all inter@@ cep@@ tions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can launch the merge .
please note : if you have not specified your target folder , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode C will be used as a goal , and when synchron@@ izing B and / or B will be used as a target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries can be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure you may change . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to un@@ cover all entries , select the directory / continue in the directory Menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to perform only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can select a valid promotion for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window with the options run , stim@@ ulate and break off .
choose Sim@@ pl@@ a if you would like to see what would happen , without the really changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( sharing a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screenshot ) .
if you are ready with a file , select / continue the directory and press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue working with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list see some error messages which are to help you choose the cause of the problem . so you have the chance to select a different action for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before you proceed to merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , these entries ( in the current session ) and execute them not checked upon later . even if the merge function has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be changed once more .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only the files that correspond to the specified pattern will be entered in the elementary tree . separate pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default folder is not listed in this pattern .
files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree . it can be used more than a pattern . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pre@@ set is * .@@ original * .@@ o .
files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree . it can be used more than a pattern . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pre@@ set is * .@@ original * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CVS . a great advantage is that this folder is specific to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a plug @-@ in attribute . in other file systems , a leading sc@@ an@@ . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled by default .
when switching to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . when the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links display . this is disabled by default .
in links to the folder : if the option is turned off , the links are turned on . if the option is turned on , the links are treated like normal files . a link to a folder shows a link on yourself and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is disabled by default .
execute a full analysis of each file by showing the statistics column . ( the number of solved , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white clas@@ ps . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when they are applied on files that do not contain text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders on a slow network , it may be quicker to compare the change date and the file size . please proceed with caution . this option is activated by default .
similar to a change date . no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical . this may be useful if copying the change date . please proceed with caution . this option is activated by default .
activate the synchron@@ ising mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the results will be identical . also , the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of merge the copying of the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this is considered un@@ certain that the other file is not changed as well . ) This option is checked in any case . ) This option is disabled .
if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted , the original version is renamed . if an old backup file is already installed with the .@@ original extension , this will also affect individual files , not only the merge file . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder merge tab stops visible to the merge of individual files ; you can turn the window panel with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window directory &amp; text window in the window menu and switch the change between the directory &amp; text window between the two views .
you will probably choose a file simply by double click . nevertheless , there is a corresponding item menu also . you can also use a single file directly , without copying the folder and the file will not run once again when you launch the folder .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory again : directory - menu : new
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders located on local or remote computers .
the first command line is compar@@ ing a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a zi@@ pped archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relatively flat . or .. it is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty line &gt; % 20 , etc . ) for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol . there is a brief list of the limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished , if a link pointing to a file or folder , then a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no way to edit author@@ iz@@ ations or change date . therefore , vary the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( please consider the size confidential . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of the purpose is currently the differences of the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first starts the built @-@ in differences . in order to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will restart the program patch to restore the missing file .
in Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select &quot; K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . additionally , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since creating the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when part is executed , it supports only the compar@@ ing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or comparison of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ den@@ um ) exists already . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 indicates that it can result in combination like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I use GPL programs already very long and learned a lot while I looked into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this path or going to go that way .
you have probably compiled the program from the sources and the configure command is probably not disclos@@ ed to the correct pre@@ fix in / us@@ r / local , but then K@@ DE may find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical but if just a non @-@ white character will be different , the line is not identical to each other , which will be the next to each other , which will be the case in the case .
the editor re@@ members every difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . that &apos;s necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the result simply as a text file and it is too much effort to design that this information might save .
the effort was so far too large . you can use a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of text should be used by another editor .
after removing text is suddenly missing ; no sr@@ c appeared ; appeared and the text doesn &apos;t be extingu@@ ished . what does it mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to create differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and l@@ acks the purpose . please use another editor for this purpose .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web . thank you !
in order to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes you will find under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
um &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system installed in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are un@@ sure you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should still experience difficulties , please report to &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists from it .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Remove ) into the clip@@ board and delete the text from the clip@@ board . adding the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ ry position and replace the current marking .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , thus also not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you need to update to these options to edit new folders using the Update function . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note the buttons to choose from the source with lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed after clicking on the button .
the default option is de@@ activated . under@@ shoot in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite convenient to view the running programs on the work surfaces to stop her size or to post@@ p@@ one it . this works both within a desktop and with several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work areas as well as those of running applications . applications can be selected and even handled on the desktop and to other purposes .
with the middle of a mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other working areas .
the context menu depends where the right mouse button is clicked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; click the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries of Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On desktop and ending . the commands make following :
maxim@@ izes the use window to the full size of desktop . only appears when it was clicked on one application .
sends the application to selected virtual desktop . only appears when it was clicked on one application .
if this check box is marked , window within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the Desktop and also to other work areas .
if this field is crossed , the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager is displayed ; the names of virtual work surfaces are displayed .
tick this field makes the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops display . is it advert@@ ised together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , eg ; 1st Desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ;
if this field is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here is the view of the program window . simple , simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol indicates a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be specified : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ p@@ av@@ ement , like pop@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers , showing all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a vertical and vertical in a vertical row , which is very suitable for the display at the side of the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display the windows as symbols or with its content . it also runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and following selecting the switch ... lets the dialog appear settings .
currently it can &apos;t be changed in dialog box , but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ er@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you don &apos;t have to apply a write permission to your system administrator . in this file you have to assign the key to wind@@ ow@@ transparent Mode and assign values to this . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , once the mouse po@@ urs a while on the same place . it is meant for helping people to em@@ ulate the Rep@@ ent Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) Syndrome and to em@@ ulate the mouse click with the mouse . however , it may require a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , can handle the pain that comes with the mouse click and helps to use so many people who are using the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can locate your computer when using your computer , if this is not done yet .
to clear it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps prevent pressed with the mouse , it is used against pain , which is caused by moving the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all the ergonomic aids , the result may exp@@ ire for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; super@@ vis@@ es your mouse movements and execute a mouse click once you break down the motion .
if the intelligent move is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is run by pushing the mouse button . in this way , you can do the drag by pressing a mouse button . the smart moving requires a little exercise but you get used to it quickly .
the time of the mouse has to be stopped at the end of the mouse button , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . a mouse click out .
when Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es switched on , the turning point is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the mouse button is waiting , before it can release the mouse button again , if no moving is done because of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; supported by clicking on the mouse . if this function is activated , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are launched in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to sh@@ orten the reaction time . go to the Sound System and click on the tab . there is a sh@@ eg@@ rowing sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is set ; for every launch of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program .
set all settings on the values that were set when opening the dialog . have already pressed the button for users , the settings are reset to the user after clicking the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first using the pre@@ ferences . in particular , the intelligent move should be switched off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the intelligent move .
if you use the audible click , it is necessary to reduce the response time of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds .
first , you should make yourself aware of which places a mouse click without effect : that click on the neutral entities of windows or on places in the browser window that does not leave any link . therefore , you can park your mouse in such places until you would like to use them again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse button , but also the roles , which come into contact with the mouse .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , the mouse is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be quick to view the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole , into which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can be easily scra@@ pped with a flat blade or the finger nails .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when you use the intelligent move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean that the operation can no longer be replaced by the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; move under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you do run a mouse click . by this , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset . back and you can continue like usual .
problem : if you input text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . continue to run mouse clicks and make the cursor itself in a different place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor place where you want to make it . but by pushing the mouse click into a neutral field of desktop , if you don &apos;t want to create a key@@ presses . secure zones for the mouse po@@ inter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart moving , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very possible to copy and paste in the clip@@ board , with which you will probably cause problems with pressed mouse button . however , here are some advice :
do not use the intelligent move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . select text instead as follows : run the Shift key down to the other end of the text and press the mouse button once again .
use the audible mouse click . this makes every time playing when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click . so you can use the intelligent move even without the audible mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
in order to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you must have the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window ; this should be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and a loudspeaker that has been set up properly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button shortly after the mouse po@@ urs . this program has been developed for people who are end@@ owed on the RS@@ I syndrome and those who ste@@ w pain in the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that a certain time is waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button is lo@@ osed . in this way , the pulling and off with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the dum@@ b users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; dum@@ b users can talk to the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the discussion platform that should be spoken again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screenshot ) , enter the command that later is used for voice output . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default Text passage book . you can often choose text pass@@ wor@@ ries without having to type in . the text pass@@ wor@@ ries can of course be processed .
on the third page ( right screen photograph ) , you determine the dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ mal . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of each words . in addition , you can only read the words of words with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can only read the words listed in the wording .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially an entry field for the keyboard input of your phr@@ ases ( the lower white field in screen screenshot ) and a flash memory of already spoken phr@@ ases ( the upper white field in screen screenshot ) .
if you can ch@@ mouth ; right , you can input the sentences you want to hear . each spoken proposition is app@@ ended to the termin@@ ates . you can select the phr@@ ases that should be spoken again .
set up with the Settings icon Settings ; set up ... Open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog includes two cards , voice output and settings , page completion and page K@@ TT@@ SD language .
in the field of box speech output , enter the command to enter the Language Bu@@ ilder . in the drop @-@ down list , specify the string de@@ coding when text is passed to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box when the text is to be passed as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as parameters . you can use the following wild@@ card :
of course , the command depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endix .
if possible , use as language service as a language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; the first try to transmit the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language . the kt@@ ts@@ d language is an &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ uses a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently in the SV@@ N further develops . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
considering the first selection field action after selecting a text passage you determine the action by selecting a text passage or by choosing a text passage in the text dam book or in the bar for text pass@@ ag@@ covers .
with the selection of immediately the selected text passage is spoken directly and in addition , the selected text passage is transferred directly into the input field , only entered the input field .
after closing the Panel window , you can specify whether the text log book is automatically stored when closing the Processing window .
when you select the text@@ book , the text@@ book is stored . if you select changes , the text pass@@ code is not stored . dial &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the text log book is to be stored .
the Wor@@ ter@@ nal Site contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the in@@ fusion . in the main window , in addition to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth provides , if this list contains more than one dictionary . in this sel@@ ector , you can select the currently used dictionary .
using the buttons on the right on the page you can add spell check dic@@ tion@@ aries or add them to a file . below the list you can select the name and select language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the single words is simply determined by comparison of the adv@@ ocate . additionally , you can compare the words listing with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , in order to add only correctly described words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can scale the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they shall be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , create a new , empty Dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abulary over time .
the main window of the window to the processing of text pass@@ ag@@ covers is divided . in the upper part the text pass@@ at@@ ters are displayed as a tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a word passage , you can change the word passage or associated keys . if you have selected a text@@ book , you can only change its name .
actions such as new text passages or books add or delete text pass@@ wor@@ ries or books you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text pass@@ ag@@ covers or text pass@@ age@@ way can be changed by pulling with the mouse to the new site or with arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is copied and copied into the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected areas of the buffer .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected areas of the buffer .
the moment@@ ary set is spoken , if text is in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected phr@@ ases in the buffer storage .
if this menu entry is enabled , a mov@@ able tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands appear . the tool bar is located directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the smart left side and drag the tool bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow strip appears in the lower part of the main window with hints about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated , if not enabled , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding bar for text pass@@ ag@@ covers is shown with entries directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the smart@@ ly left side and drag the tool can be moved to another place .
you probably have entered the command for voice output right or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the map tab . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer to further details . )
Festival is a voice output system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the licence allows the licence to use the festival free of charge and restrictions on restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the language course is assumed that festival is installed in the / us@@ r / local / festival package . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently it supports only the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and distribute without restrictions .
in order to display an example of the command line for the establishment of language versions , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / us@@ r / local / fre@@ ett folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following commands :
for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of ph@@ on@@ ys in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to use the text in ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , with the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / us@@ r / local / sister fax and / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to send the last character of the text , so an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / us@@ r / local / host@@ rock / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option should be turned on as default input .
the speech output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is an &amp; k@@ de ; further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since adjustment of the Qu@@ TT is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you need to use only kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to set the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , which depends on each of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a application , with man who can not speak English text by the calcul@@ ator . it &apos;s stored a list of already spoken pro@@ positions which allows users to re @-@ re@@ print .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . on the machine , a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

in addition to the bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find out the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essibility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you have to install and properly set program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . see also
for the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as yet no speakers are set up , the flash@@ card details will be shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker you will see the map of General . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer various languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those who are in volume or speed . you should also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , since the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise use the standard speakers .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with multiple printer spo@@ ils for the same printer .
if you click on the flash@@ card speakers in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the flash@@ card box will appear automatically . this will then automatically start when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and no nar@@ rator .
all subscri@@ ptions appear in this list . the preferred spokes@@ man will appear in the list . the Supreme spokes@@ man will be used for voice output if there is no speaker .
in a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the spokes@@ man from the list .
select a mouse click a message from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a mouse click with a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to move the spokes@@ man in the list below . the order of the speakers in the list specifies its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; medium ; -@@ System .
choose here a vocal type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and maid &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new spokes@@ man will appear on the map box Spe@@ aker . to change the settings of this Spe@@ aker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can already use it . go back to the map of the map ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) and check if speech output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . see now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; please click on the map box assign@@ ments to create and manage output jobs . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can select the language display system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map charts in order to open this box card . here you can set a few general options .
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this start@@ up is successfully displayed , and you can create text contracts and read it . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS @-@ System from &amp; k@@ de is de@@ activated .
when t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is terminated , it runs &amp; drop ; continue when enabled field of voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and t@@ m@@ sm@@ gr is automatically appearing in the Control Panel automatically , it dis@@ appears as soon as the read has been completed .
using the buttons in this series , you can launch text contracts , stop , stop and record .
using the buttons in this series you can pre @-@ read the current text in &amp; k@@ de ; file clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click on User or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the ticket orders will only appear when K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the flash@@ card and tick your voice card ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts . then mark the text that will read before . after a short time , the voice should start .
it is almost always meaningful to select the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; feed lines and other invisible stamps are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the displayed text on . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts . then mark the text that will read before , and then choose the text editor tool@@ bar . then select the voice output .
this also works if &amp; Kate . embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Quant@@ a ; .
K@@ Not@@ ify is the message system from &amp; k@@ de ; you will notify you of events specified by you . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read it .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; based on the IR@@ C program from &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up &amp; conversation ; for instance , you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , that you will notify you in a IR@@ C @-@ channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C news message .
supports an &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Not@@ ify , appears a menu entry not@@ if@@ ications in the Settings menu . the here possible settings for K@@ Not@@ ify differ according to application .
filter for character sets offer a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; wrong stressed or faulty messages is a good example . the tags b@@ r and b comes from the news , the K@@ Mail sent , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be accepted as required .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
in filters , text will be processed before he will be sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations to select a matching language and spokes@@ man or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the work of fil@@ tering , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts .
the output of screen@@ shots has the highest priority . it will be with@@ drawn to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the Screen Reader is read , the kept orders will be continued again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and holds the output of news and regular text . these orders will continue after the release of the warning .
News have the next one priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of a application that can read messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page , you can read &amp; k@@ mouth . &amp; k@@ . ; not@@ if@@ ications are also news . read this .
the rest are simple text contracts . each order , which you to@@ ff from the card card , is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications used by text contracts . text contracts are designed for the output longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . if a application sends the issue of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a read , this output will stop and stop .
first you need to know that filters can never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , news and text contracts , and &amp; k@@ de ; messages are applied .
filter editing the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three kinds of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
string drop@@ outs replace parts of a text by other text . the replacement parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is possible by using Chat @-@ Emot@@ ions like : - ) by text or for the form@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; K@@ Mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the delivery of &amp; boards ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with Spe@@ aking Search filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or on the program that send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have submitted an example on the map memory card a female voice , you can read list@@ ings by K@@ DE messages . read more about this .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which he does not apply to voice output . if the filter shows that its rules are not able to apply the text on the next filter .
if a text contract is sent to a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; Not@@ ification on &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be processed by all activated filters that are rendered on the page below . the processing by the filter is carried out in the order from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the submitted normal filter . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of the filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs will be shown below .
for setting up character set filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison pattern . then , the text will be exchanged in the text , then the text will not be considered against the related spare text .
enter a name for your filters . you can choose this name as you wish , only from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in column match and replace it in accordance with the string from the column Set . the list will be processed from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can store a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , save the current list or delete the list from a file , the entries are attached to the existing list .
if the text is registered here , the filter will only be used if the spokes@@ man speaks for the text contract one of the languages registered here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ trl ; button pressed .
if a value is registered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can input several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , K@@ Mail
the user ID @-@ running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ numbers you have to om@@ it . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the user ID Cop@@ ter ID 34@@ 32 is allowed .
the character set filter is only applied to the text , if all the conditions with one entry in the box Apply filter . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all text .
when compar@@ ing words , the dup@@ lic@@ encing filter uses regular expres@@ sions in the form of \ \ S word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no manual for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; Ver@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; Ver@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ver@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be found in the box .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such revers@@ als . however , the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program program must be installed on your system .
enter the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the ambient variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
you can send text to a certain spokesperson , which is set up on the map memory card , or to a speaker with specific properties . for example , you can define that texts of K@@ Mail can be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text transmitted to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the spokes@@ man will be selected based on the spokes@@ man and text ; the spokes@@ man and the attributes shown on the map material Sp@@ ok@@ es@@ man are selected . with the speaker @-@ selection filter , you can write the elected spokes@@ man .
if the text is registered here , the filter will be applied , if the text has the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; Ver@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; Please call it by clicking on the button in order to receive help when entering the input .
to anchor a faster process , you should try to anchor the regular expression from the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
set the properties of the speaker you want . if the text is selected the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements at the e@@ he@@ avi@@ est . click on the button on the right to view the dialog sel@@ ector .
use these buttons to save or delete your speaker settings , or delete all settings .
the optional notification filter is only applied to the text if all the conditions apply to the box di@@ esen filter if you apply . you must apply at least one condition .
the speech output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , can provide with the programmer their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD Module API , with the syn@@ thesizer , can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; it can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section includes a short description of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ Interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications are calling for voice information about the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d about the Object K@@ Speech .
text on text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands ,
open two &amp; console buttons ; don &apos;t start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned Spanish syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up &amp; HTML ; XML ; re@@ shaping filters , but not read by using the module for festival websites .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ B@@ LE is not working even if you don &apos;t have this voice to read out of web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and to find the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or ad@@ dictions seem to cause mistakes during the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ f@@ ade will be given . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure that the sub@@ code option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . there may be problems with certain characters or words , may this may be fixed by a string disk filter .

the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license you can find in the related documentation or on the associated sites . there are also voices that own a separate license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code , you can download the package k@@ acc@@ acc@@ essibility with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can also find the source code from k@@ de@@ acc@@ essibility to ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages you can find at the repository htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ac@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and I@@ bio .
KT@@ TS also works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched at the command line in one &amp; console .
the list of languages listed above can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . check out the page &apos;s website , according to information which is not included in this manual .
the &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program uses a adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you wish to expand &amp; kt@@ ts , you get in touch with the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is however not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; t , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the software files for the &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program .
if you purchase the source texts from &amp; boards ; you can purchase and install the source archive for k@@ de@@ acc@@ essibility , or download the program created every night , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do this , you can use the shell scripts sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 , the first version of &amp; tile is used , that the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher uses . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is designed to be so advanced that the installation of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can withdraw Sat@@ z@@ - or off @-@ sat@@ in , repeat the output or break down .
if you like an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; it can be used for example if you choose a female English speaker . if you like a speaker , this is used , otherwise the best proper speaker can be used . if you want to learn more about it , like &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker chosen , see you in .
if you click on the map tab to add or click Edit on the map or click Edit , the box Spe@@ aker spokes@@ man will be displayed . for example , the box will be presented below the module for Festival Interactive . for details on the modules you will find below .
enter the itiner@@ ary of the executable program . if the path is included in the festival in PAT@@ H , you only need to enter the festival .
choose the string de@@ coding for text , which will be handed over to the festival . in case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is generally valid that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 are widely used , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak : ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controls and display this grey , the voice selected by you does not allow these settings .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes needed to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you check this check box , these voices are loaded already during the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( when large memory consumption ) the first set becomes faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet been instit@@ uted ( or forgot at the user ) .
if this check box is checked , the program window t@@ sm@@ gr is displayed in the program window . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol of t@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the system section to preview the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not work yet , it appears in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this gives you the opportunity to stop reading or otherwise control the text .
here are all the orders listed in queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of phr@@ ases and the precisely defined set . the speaker ID equals the PG@@ D column .
using the buttons in this series you can spare part in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all alter@@ ations of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is shr@@ inks for the symbol in the system section . click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed but AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card box audio . see also .
here , only text contracts are listed and managed . expenses of screen re@@ jects , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information about the t@@ elecommun@@ ications types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; be found here .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module , or &amp; kt@@ ts , can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , check here the audio output . if no output modules are shown in the list , you need to select at least one module . have you chosen here the PCM device . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to the double normal speech speed . to enable this settings to be implemented , the program must be SO@@ X installed .
click Apply to apply the new settings for the current &amp; medium ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in case of doubt , select Standard .
on this map you can set specific actions which are always executed when the word order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four kinds of voice entries :
the output of screen@@ shots has the highest priority . it will be with@@ drawn to all other entries , and has read these orders . after the output of the Screen Reader was read again , the kept orders will be resumed .
war@@ nings have priority considered . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning will keep the output of news and regular text . these orders will continue after the warning of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of a application that can read messages . if you &amp; eg ; just a long text on a web page you can agree with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone pleased that enters the room .
when a text contract is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played when a normal text request is interrupted . if both in@@ line sound and introduc@@ tory message is active , the cat@@ en@@ ant sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map are only valid for normal text contracts . for messages , war@@ nings , and expenditure of screen promotions , there are no particular promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to report with &amp; kt@@ ts ; start reading &amp; Not@@ ify messages , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on not@@ if@@ ications . the flash@@ card not@@ if@@ ications appears .
check this check box to disable &amp; k@@ de ; alert not@@ if@@ ications . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; t@@ kt@@ ts read no notification .
when this setting is selected , not@@ if@@ ications where a sound is played , not read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read before .
use these buttons to add events to the list or add them . if you click on the button Add a dialog where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message above , the &amp; conversation ; sent when somebody men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events in which nothing else is given in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this field to specify what &amp; boards do ; if an event meets . you have the following selection :
if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ card :
you can enter the properties of the required speaker here . standard choose the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map memory card as a top entry .
note that there are three levels for events . if a specific event of a certain application is specified , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be specified for all other events of the particular application . the action is to carry out the action under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All not@@ if@@ ications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list ) for this purpose , you can specify the forward messages as follows :
use the button Save to load the settings for the messages into a file . read the button store to load stored settings on the list . when you start with an empty list , click on del@@ etion . all entries except all not@@ if@@ ications will be deleted .
the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard , in order to mark text for voice output , the speech speed , the noise , the sex , and the pitch . for example , SS@@ ML is a part of the vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently , SS@@ ML supports only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are present :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ monitor voice ( British male ) since this is the standard voice , the festival is used at the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival @-@ configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , the SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two kinds of filters - normal filters and typ@@ ing limit@@ ing filters ( SD@@ B @-@ filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must start to read and start with the first set of syn@@ thes@@ ize , not the whole word order . thus , you can jump or stop , even if the language syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported .
here you see the typ@@ ing @-@ evident filters . in the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the pre@@ ference is automatically set up . you can change the settings or add another typ@@ ography filter , beginners will not use it .
the easiest way to test up the device selection by phone . switch on the box selection as well . switch off the box selection again , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker changed . to do this , you have to have more than one speaker changed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then quicker with the read can begin , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole word block what can take very long ,
you will then be able to execute or cancel text orders on the map tab , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons the normal user @-@ limit@@ ing filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ sm@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be disabled but do not change anything at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
automatically compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positions and add a tab character ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ positi@@ onal sign ( dec@@ imal notation is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default set limit@@ ing filter is retained .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( com@@ p ) , war@@ nings , news or output of screen re@@ a@@ ds .
if you have already removed the normal and limit@@ less filter @-@ filter , you can insert it again by loading the specified _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
you can write the map settings on the map tab . the map will be displayed if
use of the standard microphone ( the top on the map tab ) . with other words , there are no inter@@ mitt@@ ing properties .
using the most @-@ out speaker , which has not used or edit all the features of the speaker . if you select &amp; ts the settings of the speaker . otherwise select &amp; ts ; the nar@@ ration , which is the e@@ he@@ p@@ est the originally set characteristics .
select the method to enter the desired payment features by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
choose the properties of the wished speaker here . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing .
check this check box where the property should have prec@@ e@@ dence over other features . you can also place multiple markings .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language lies before , when you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than that of the working environment .
to use all the properties in the area speaker , which matches the following below , click on the S@@ election tab , and then apply for nar@@ rator , which matches the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the final text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a serial number . ( no order number is required to enter 0 ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr crash@@ es when it started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any trace@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is tum@@ bler and ton@@ ne . probably you must register G@@ Stre@@ amer . when the problem is not solved , possibly a non compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears on the &amp; console ; a message appears , which says : to open PCM .
on your system , there is the problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA have to prevent a simultaneous opening of several PCM devices . the information on possible solutions will be found on the web page of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ amp@@ t@@ .org .
I have downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed them and can &apos;t use it in festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . by doing so , you will find in the instructions that will be delivered with festival . if you like to read the web pages you need to install the ( male ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions .

this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , one module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that enables the administration of network interfaces , of routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a set of system and desktop settings through a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the user :
after installation , a new module network setting is installed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Centre ; you can configure network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) . it can be launched by selecting from k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical equipment and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; this device can be seen at all and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices will be installed while installing and set up . will network appliances be added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Settings module is loaded when the network settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting module settings this system is trying to automatically detect the platform on the system .
if the platform is not detected , the manual selection is offered . it is best used to select the distribution and release date . by marking the setting up @-@ again the setting can be hit permanently . in the next start of the network settings this selection will be pre@@ set automatically .
changing the network settings is possible only in system administ@@ rators , meaning that the settings can only be considered , the change can only be considered . in the system administration mode you can reach the right bottom end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password mode .
in system management mode the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the tab network interfaces serves for managing the network devices of the system . all available network appliances are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out from the tab network interfaces :
set the settings shown for network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button ... in the dialog device can be set up .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . please click on the button with continued possibilities .
in automatic mode the TCP / IP settings are taken from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP address for any system start is needed . in the sel@@ ective list , no further settings are required . in the list box can be selected either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system .
with the choice manual , the TCP / IP address can be performed using DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the required TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system will initi@@ alize the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as the features of the device in the box .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not used yet . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the requested address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices may be enabled or switched on if required . switch off one @-@ off network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network appliances can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . de@@ activated a activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net specifies the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communications with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if the computer is more than one network interface , the interface on the network must be selected , where the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces the full IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer is only possible to use IP addresses , DNS calls this name to an IP address like 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution is a simple copy of this list . entries can be added , removed or amended .@@ DNS entries can be added by selecting an insert and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons below or down in the priority .
when pressing the button Add ... from the group computer to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will add the new name server to the dialog box .
first you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the machine computer to name resolution you choose an entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will show the dialog box .
the list of well @-@ known computers represents the name @-@ to @-@ IP address inter@@ mitt@@ ance to the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list contains well @-@ known computers a few entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ak@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses are supported , and the current version of IP is still to be replaced in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well known computer and then click Add .... The New Deal appears Add as alias .
enter the name of the well known computer and click the Add @-@ name button . if the known machine has several alias name , add the button Add several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box is displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then by clicking it OK the list of static hosts is updated .
the settings specified in the module settings are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be removed .
the homepage from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installing the binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm ) packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de is installed ; and Q@@ t is installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case , Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de are just sufficient , but also the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is only recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile . the following commands should accomplish this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; altered configuration files will be discussed .
this area may not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endix contains only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks are currently run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never been found great dis@@ semin@@ ation . IPv6 will continue to handle it in the near future . this description is currently focused on the spread of IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address of a network interface is enabled . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the response agency that is available in DH@@ CP . in any case , the IP address may not simply be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially designated for this purpose , to avoid IP addressing conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks are usually used in the range of 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is big enough for networks up to 250 hosts .
additionally , the net mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0.@@ 1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for IP transmission .
the 12@@ 7.0@@ .0.@@ 1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally the address is assigned 12@@ 7.0@@ .0.@@ 1 of an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part you will find the configuration files that are regulated by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes altered at DSL connections , so it would not be surprised if there is no other content in case of active DSL connection .

&amp; k@@ dat , is a program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which showed the ability of d@@ ds@@ 2@@ tar to fast , sel@@ ective un@@ packing . the second purpose was the answer of a tar which my wife lasted , how much longer it takes ?
before a band can be used , it has to be modified by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; join the tape and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the band . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the leader on the tape does not , you will ask if the tape is supposed to be format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat , searching for the matching index on your plate . if it cannot be found , you will be asked whether the index index should be created .
everything went smoothly , the symbol of the tape drive , in order to indicate that the tape has been shown . according to the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the band can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the belt .
before e@@ ject the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; is recogni@@ zable by changing the symbol for the tape , that the binding for the tape has been solved , and shows a corresponding message in the stat@@ us@@ bar . the tape can now be thrown out without any danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat , used , it must be format@@ ted and format@@ ted .
a band types must be format@@ ted before you need to store data . this process does not match the form@@ atting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not need to form@@ atting the tape . floppy disk drives usually have a form@@ atting of the band , DA@@ T drives .
after entering the band name and capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat , with the form@@ atting of the tape . all data on the tape are lost . after completion of the form@@ atting , the tape is automatically mounted and ready to use .
before you start the backup procedure , you need to select the backup files . that can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in a local file tree . it will only be stored in this file or folder .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files are stored in the profile .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select the Backup menu ...
once the backup is introduced , the dialog for backup . in this dialog you can again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
once you confirm the att@@ itudes , the dialog to backup . the dialog shows the backup of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the entries in the entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
check the files in one of the archives created in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry check ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog for checking . in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the work@@ folder for review .
if you confirm the settings for review , the dialog appears ass@@ ess@@ ments . this dialog shows the progress of the test process , as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you recover the restore , the files need to be restored , the files are to be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in any of the archives that belong to the tape record . it will be restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders restored .
right click with the right button of the mouse on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore on the menu ....
once the restore process has been started , the dialog for rest@@ oring . in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the work@@ folder for recovery .
once you confirm the settings for rest@@ oring , the dialog appears again . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process , as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to re@@ produce the band@@ index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ produce the index in two ways from the band :
this provides a safety profile with the currently selected files and standard settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current sub@@ folder , where the backup should take place . the list of stored files will be updated automatically according to the selected web folders .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , that can only be secured on the same file system , such as the folder . folders that can be installed on other file systems . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be created . only the files have changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used to determine changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all the files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons &apos;s buttons ; and lt ; missing ; files were not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
set the settings by setting up the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... settings in the Settings menu . the following settings may be done :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / Tape ) . this path needs to refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the belt .
is this setting active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat , before the tape is mounted to the drive . at some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , the option tries to lock the tape . maybe this setting is not working with all band@@ its .
if the option is on , the tape is switched off by &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically e@@ jected the tape . do not use this option with floppy streaming .
if the option is switched ON , &amp; k@@ dat ; change the hardware code size for the tape drive . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case you have to share the log size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is as follows :
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is : seconds , where machine name is the full name of the system , on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been format@@ ted since the time in which the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives created directly with &amp; GNU / tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active if a band is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer suitable for system logs . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about the various protocol files , for example , with fast access to information about problems which appear on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background . the program is suitable for unexpected users who cannot know where to get information about your system or where the system de@@ parts the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides , experienced users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; thus tries to deliver some advanced functions , which can be filtered and analyzed by the protocol files .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log has a number of useful functions . among other things include :
support for many different types of log files , for the file of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and sam@@ ba
many other functions are also contained and explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen screenshot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , using their help to fil@@ tering the single protocol @-@ lines of a protocol and fil@@ tering the various options for sorting and filters in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system Protocol - to open . will not start with system administrator . the protocol files are usually done under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user does not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected crit@@ er@@ ion or for entered character sets . in addition , a string column is displayed next to the selected filter . in addition , a log line will be displayed next to the filter . then , a log line appears only if in a column the string search string is included .
you can also select another entry in this position . select the string of the filter search page , then select the column process in the corresponding column , and also bear the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol @-@ lines which were sent or created from this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to see the important protocol @-@ lines . protocol @-@ lines of the level error are displayed with a striking colour as protocol @-@ lines of the level indicator . the color display of protocol @-@ lines can be shut down dialog box .
if you want to show only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can select the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process case . this may be useful for example if you want to insp@@ ect the output of a specified command , such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , you will use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the Add To New Lines option in the main window of the main window to view all new protocol @-@ lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ .@@ log ; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol on the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website based on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. date you find further information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also known as known as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it quickly develops into the standard for controlling the program start @-@ up of the system in the Linux ; world . and this is why it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further along with historical aspects ( among others because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ aries is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important , because perhaps someone could try to transfer a machine on System V In@@ it without a re @-@ installation and re @-@ format . that &apos;s why you must make sure that the old In@@ it has been removed from there if there was one file there .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
init@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service you want to start at the high drive system or when moving to another run@@ level . system services , however , do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also let go a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel searches in various places after the program in@@ it and starts the first to find .
the default run@@ level is set in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see one line in the beginning as the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column , and probably realize that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix them if you do not change it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder no correct files are . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the directory init@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : any of the scripts are written so it &apos;s an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as :
this would stop the htt@@ pd server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the an K contains , the script runs with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running level , which can only run htt@@ pd , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running , &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; you should not be very difficult because the program was built as user friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another display device is easy to not say , tri@@ vial : simply drag the entry from the range of avail@@ ables to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also shift scripts between Run@@ lev@@ els or change the position within one level by moving it somewhere else . this is only happening in the entry of his original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens when they draw an entry in the field of avail@@ ables .
note : entries are moved when you copy them into a new field . in order to copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the menu or add from the context menu -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the promotion .
the sorting number of any single entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to add the system service .
note : there is no way to restore entries , which have been thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . so caution .
you can use the tab@@ ulator key to activate the different working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 stop , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection lower or below the previous function .
to move an entry into another round level , move it with cut@@ ing into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; x ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change sorting order number or name of a single entry manually , press the tab key to open the Properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the button to accept the changes , or press En@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
due to the risk of data loss all entries in the menu requires a confirmation before it is executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if it is available . otherwise , they will be stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it will be stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have tried experiment@@ ing with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eln , and now the machine will constantly start . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the entry button to start in individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended to run under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions .
the way that system services can be started in these distri@@ butions , simplified the configuration for proprietary establ@@ ishments of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution here : check if all configuration files are present ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ pd ) just termin@@ ate without a message when their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the meaning of the Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is enough to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
once you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the appropriate symbol of tool@@ bar or record saving in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the user or group characteristics .
some cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you have limited system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a card card will be made , if shadow @-@ passwords or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as BSD port .
the password author@@ ization mode appears , if shadow passwords or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD port .
this box card only appears when enabled and initi@@ alized ( Qu@@ ota ) for at least one built @-@ in fil@@ esystem ( Qu@@ ota ) . here you can change parameters for each user parameter , with the limited number of data in KB .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the array file system .
the groups will be informed about the user belonging to the selected user . the standard group , which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ acy Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in the field by selecting these in the large field .
the dialog ability tab contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select Add User or Move menu or click the edit button . edit or delete the selected user or the selected group .
with this module , you can add the L@@ ILO @-@ Bo@@ ats , add and change the boot time , change the time until for bo@@ oting the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change , modify and change operating systems .
