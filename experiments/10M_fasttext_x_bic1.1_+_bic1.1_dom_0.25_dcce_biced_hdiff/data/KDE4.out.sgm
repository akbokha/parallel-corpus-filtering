<seg id="15">& fsview; reflects the size of a file or folder where the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries within. accordingly, it can be easily detected as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview, an entry in the Treemap display provides a rectangle, which represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation, the rectangles have reasonable color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched over the view color mode, can either be depth for the slight detection of the waste depth or the picture of another file size as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each feature, you can specify if sufficient space is present or if the area is displayed by limitations during the sign of the Treemap. in addition, you can define the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle below.</seg>
<seg id="19">With the creation algorithm for Treemaps, the rule is proportional to the size of the entry. at the treemap in & fsview, this goal will not always be kept. note that less space for the frame is lost when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As an indication of the area of a single entry for the subordinate entries, the implementation will be provided so that there are always beneficial the surfaces that are square. the best methods of this respect are lines, columns or recalsive second.</seg>

<seg id="75">& digipist, the program gPhoto2 is used for communicating digital cameras, which has an ever increasing number of digital cameras, a widely used protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the machine. since photos in general are large files and transmissions over the serial port, this connection is now deprecated. & digiplug, this link supports the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support, so that EXIF support is necessary to read the thumbnails. if EXIF support is not available in libgphoto2, you may be unable to do any thumbnails or creating it may be very slow.</seg>

<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other demands such as versioning photos, archiving, working processes, constant delivery of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will and you will not re-organize your structure for that content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing simpler. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are searching for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata store in the format of the metadata in & digiplug; this ensures that EXIF data and IPTC data can be stored into the file. if you remember, then you can select the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change them? this includes a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now start the real work, since you need to select each photo words, labeling and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that you can use the same attribute. this makes sense, as you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's talk with keywords, keywords, how you can proceed in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import a catalog from another source with embedded keywords, then apply the tree to the correct place. the change of the Hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can be easily done by pulling a subtree on another. the modified box is being done by & digious; updated while the subtree is pursued.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is outcrop. this is a very rough representation, since each block consists of metadata in truth in many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keyword - the next section refers to labeling or comments, the third important tool to catalogise your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people want to simply let your photos look simply, you want to share it with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are certainly interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer to it, you'll catch some details to see it, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this of the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing, you may even hear the silence, you might even hear the silence. the writing has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others consider the title is perhaps more important than the image itself to create a story. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to help him understand about the motive that you are moving about what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's ok if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for themselves alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digious, you can save as much text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), and you can even export a spell checker. if you can even export your pictures to the label and / or the title of the web Galeriesystems if you don't have to tell you a second time for the recording and / or the title of the web gallery.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find yourself in another city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet before GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train departs the spatial presentation now with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of co-use are already innumerable and become deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can also export your travels to Google Earth. you can also export the pictures in Google Earth. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc. by using Google Earth maps.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word play with Copyright and denotes the practice the copyright to remove the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, thus also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digicame; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographer, e.g., in order to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organisation could not be changed. this field does not support Comma nor Semicolons as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (synonym for author): links with the author. this field contains the job title of the photographer. examples of this can be as a freelance photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify which means a photo agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations might be listed here. if the photograph shows a picture, then the group / agency will be shown here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not have any protection against abuse. any one who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calculator, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digious, such a module will provide such a module for staple processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record bug, record failures, rafts, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same they can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negative. in this section, these are problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Bankroll, the greatest data recovery firm in the world, has some interesting statistics which has a potential data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To be able to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs which need to be kept more careful and one may not trust you more than a couple of years. of course there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 that piece that can claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe it is in your modeling room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable but you can use this risk in which you can use good dispks and good recording devices and keep them in the correct way, but they are much more expensive than the cheapest, but they are much reliable to choose.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to mistakes, even if you have just been written. that's why they use a control mechanism to protect themselves. because of this massive protection it is needed by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a cheap program called IsoBuster which seems to do wonders for CDs and DVDs. it is also not available for Macs. there are also similar applications that read damaged data from damaged floppies, hard drives, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format of the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can store up to 50 GB and thus, almost six times the capacity of a Dual-Player DVD with 8,5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn your data with a good recording device on high-quality media in a not expropriate format. if you want to copy the media with a clean, dark dry and prior to animals protected site. please do not forget to print the data to the next generation of media or software that can read out the media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskproducers retain their statistics for themselves. your manufacturer factors include a new disk but not the data. Google sets a big field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives: disk error</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: discos keep the longest when you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. these errors are the most common error cause, SMART can not determine this error. some of SMART reported error messages. these are particularly readers and publishing count. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only about the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a blackout before you secured the files, but these losses usually leave without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices don't make much of those devices with computer chips and high-speed profiles, these can take heavy damage. on your computer you can use these anomalies, broken motherboards and other defects. so, protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against currents is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs energy and the rest. it is usually obtainable in the form of a plug-in. however, remember that each plug-bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overload protection, then you should take care of the UL 1449 standard. this ensures a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care of protecting the protection against lightning bolt and protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of any cable can be used to your computer, you should also ensure that all peripherals are connected to your system. some manufacturers provide an overvoltage for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially developed for notebooks, and therefore you also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you. even a failure of only few seconds can result in the loss of irreplaceable data. it may therefore be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection against overtension, these tools can automatically increase the battery power if a power outage occurs. some models allow them to save them up to the stream. if you have a USV then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the life time of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare it with costs for avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 euro. this is just a small price difference if you remember to keep your computer with it. at the end, you should always remember all cables to trenne before you get into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the correct configuration you can connect this as a drive under & Linux; Mac, and Windows. this allows you to save this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that you can save any amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive in comparison to the hard drives at home but very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you have to send the data over a relatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is no general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online memory services that are stored on photos. their free memory is limited to 1GB. the professional version provides you more at your disposal, in case of Flickr. for $25 a year you'll get unlimited memory, which should not be verified in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">In view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocols and the big companies are included in the offer of backup and fitter memory. thus, they are deserving.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission sequence on the machine. all transfers are susceptible to transfer errors. the filesystem support and btrfs are at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk safe.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. no one appears to be in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. no one seems to have thought about it. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocols is much more secure data away than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transfers, because they generate interferences within the data stream. with normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transfers, you should look into the future. before 2010 you'll see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates in order to handle and highly scalable: it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. this article is available soon for & Linux; and now, please read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms and is also available for & Linux; however, it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate that! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% for the job systems. on notebooks already the proportion of robbery is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most. it leads to lower harm than such as theft or new installations. and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; there was already no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal even better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to the common file systems. find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: incorrect, only the rate of trial period during an operation is higher and a undefined status is avoided. if a file is not completely saved before the problem came up, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: incorrect, theft and human error are the major causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are removed 1-2 blinding settings from fundamental physical limits. the fact that during the technology, there is a natural limit for that progress. sensitivity and scope characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from that limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras enter the direction of 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deteriorated for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive will be responsible today for 100 & euro. so do not make anyone affected by any data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected by a data loss during each year and test this backup before you do anything out as the reinstall of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash drives you happiness when the drive in the moment was not connected.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster hits local and destroys a lot. forget airplane gap: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are safe enough for your data. they usually affect an entire room or entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention is not a local storage. bring your backups up to the stairway, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as already mentioned above is a common cause of data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that are to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two points: the complete backup and the last difference backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Inincremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. you can produce the original status at any time again. this fuse comes to a versioning system the next one with the exception it is only absented and not going on.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily move to your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync just copied the difference of files that really changed. this happens and if you want to increase the security of ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another visual medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach will allow you enough time to detect and recover losses. at the same time, you come up for the backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the work files. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot of each month. any further dilution should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, re-find images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visibility,...</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year, that is about the time span in which you really are interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you have to consider with caution and assess the time. unfortunately, there are no other possibility to be incompatible as the current system. however, less versions you have used in the past, the easier is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by using the explanations in this document. use / switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that's important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and fuse technology or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this means always increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go that you have planning the scalability with it and put up the area you want on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and store it onto a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg, whether your new plate was detected by the system, but they don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC # source, the new record / dev / SDC & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBs; # will change with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollar; residence permit / dev / sadc1 # change the size of navigation FS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read it, then you can create these yourself. this task is easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that appears slowly from the market. you should therefore not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard, but it can save a lot more. it is fun-free, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit, and full transparency. PNG can be used as many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF, and this format will we recommend you to store your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed format or in a container with a lossless compression salm. a problem is however, however, that this format has been adjusted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital negatives file format is a licensed and open image format that was developed by Adobe Systems. it is now based on TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata. a handful camera maker is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe introduced XML based XMP technology; it is a mix of XML and RDF. the file information is available with the extension & quot; the file information is stored in the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to record a original of your recording, mostly seen in the raw format, as it saves the metadata in separately from the image file. however, you can think about the link between the metadata stream and the image file. therefore, you should think if you are using DNG as a container and place everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports a great range of application and business models. among the activities of DCMI, the work on the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and reconnaissful efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera, you can use this as temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your repository. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">You can use external programs for a layer of layer. when you return the images with & digious, then you should add the metadata again. these were then cut by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital watermark. then export them in MPEG, you can use in MPEG, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digious; add a description how you already have to add photos that you already have on your hard disk. but the camera interface lets you give you many advanced settings to importing images to your nightmare bank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, connect it to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in your camera manual.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it's trying to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a fertile indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are shown. if this is the case, the filename and a symbol for file access will appear for each file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need to view the camera information to each entry. with the sidebars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer. note that in some digital cameras, no information will be available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer remark, GPS etc of the image. these information are the same as if the metadata side bar comes from the main window of & digious; or the image processing. please note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all photos. this will download all photos from their camera into one single album in & digious;. during download the photos are not deleted, and we recommend to check if you delete pictures from your camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos you want to download the desired choice of default options by & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the button Download and then select the selected one as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New Download is available. these pictures have not been downloaded from & digious; for example, the new pictures have been downloaded by a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you choose the buttons All download or download the chosen albums, a dialog with which you can select the target album is displayed in which the photos are sorted, see in section My Albums tab. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digicame; download photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all of them. if you only want to delete a few, you must first select it and delete the selected file.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover the photos you've deleted from the camera. if you are not deleted from the camera. if you want to remove it completely from the camera. if you want to remove it from camera, you should make it more faster than the camera name, since it is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos frequently not meaningful name. the filenames are normally utilized once again. this can be used to double file names, in case you have photos of different recording scenes in the same album. therefore, it may be reasonable, the date and time when the image was taken into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors the image and for data bases. if you are using this last option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during the transmission opens three additional options that are done before the photos will be stored on the plate via the author in the standard tab. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the EXIF data into the IPTC-fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. then switch on the date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the option for camera filenames, you have the option to change the filenames in lowercase. or in uppercase if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digiplug, is displayed below the name, which will display the camera in preview. your settings for renaming will be stored and automatically used when you start the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digider, it is possible to use all information about the camera for the time point of recording, in order to perform an automatic rotation during the shutdown. not all cameras make this information ready. in the section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera doesn't supply these information, leaves & digider; the photo in the original orientation or when you turn the automatic turn off and select the automatic rotation in the lower window of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information on the date, at which the photo was made, can use & digious; this subverbs are based on the image data. all images with the same date are available in the same sub-album. not all the cameras make this information available. in the section lateral meta data you can consult what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually off, and in this case, it stores & digious; the photos directly from the target album. if you want to change this option, use the button labeled and select the Dateline-based undername at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to their camera is the button download. then select uploading. the file selection dialog box & kde is to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the Standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks and digiplug; you, where the images will be uploaded. select the desired file and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. thus, a position is meant that can be displayed in longitudinal and latitude, and the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photography can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic place. not everyone uses a plane to record an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural office and estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you miss them later, where exactly the photo was taken, you can click with a click to view the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digious; user wishes to locate the place of the photos thus, it is good to save the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how does the GPS data come in the image? first you should know that exiv2 is supported by many GPS data fields, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways of reaching the data and image files using the KIPI module for geographic assignment (manual) and last about manual input of familiar locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated GPS unit. but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers. either as a map module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from one device can be done with gpsone or GPSBabel. however, they must save those data in GPX format as this is the only format supported by the Geographical arrangement module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you want to know the length and latitudinal and latitudinal and other data, then you can use this script using the exifconfig utility by Phil Harvey. it uses the signs of coated coordinates, e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street types. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digider, she tries to give you so much control over its operations as possible. there are many settings, which have to change the behaviour of & digious; set up in eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on rected previewing or starting image processing. so you place the default behaviour of & digious; tightly, when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains how shown below, the standards didactic and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields, when the option is synchronized in the IPTC data. this data is also written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for the author. this field should be the profession of the photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for provider: use this field to specify the photo. this should not be the author unless this is a picture agency like Reuters or Associated Press; if the picture is a bearing picture, then the group or agency should be at your disposal here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC-actions save the data in the respective IPTC Fellow. this causes the metadata permanently contained in the image and not only available in the database of & digious; these metadata is also available in & digious; and they can be imported without losing.</seg>
<seg id="289">Memorcs as embedded labelling (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: these synchronizes the comments which you include too to your photos, which are contained in pictures that are already embedded in pictures, they are overwritten by & digious.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear in the main window over a file. according to the selected option, this information will appear or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug, a number of different video formats and some video formats and audio formats. to specify which file types & digipite, you can specify the file extensions of this list; source folders which has no such extension has been ignored by & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings again by pressing the button update on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the light of & digious; can be put on this page on the default values. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode. if you have one, then you can only get on fast computers. if you have one, then you can obtain better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer another color, you can select it here. you can use the tool bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or brighter colour in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing, this picture mode can be switched off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-sampling, the images may be encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia about the close account.</seg>
<seg id="297">With PNG-compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation is not reducing the image quality because PNG has a lossless algorithm. if you have a quick calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. this means that 1: a low and 9 means a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF-files, you can switch the deflate compress mode for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF output. it does not influence the image quality since the deflate algorithm is lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss of loss JPEG 2000 files you can save lossless JPEG 2000 files. even if you have written the loss set setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata is not yet supported but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digious, the image processing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it evolves very quickly to manipulate your photos. with this dialog you can change the image processing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are identical. if you are using this option, this difference is a bit soft, eliminates this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option discerns the picture a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 Gittering pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, whitefields will be used to the camera. otherwise, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white background is not set. it is used to use solid colour balance, which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors have the effect that underexposed images in four steps will get more detail in the shafers. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top light, so the parts of your camera are the seared to capture the hottest white in the settings. in addition, the setting shines through the inability of your camera. lastly, you can try to reconstruct quite some parts of the missing information from the top light.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & twigs try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares of the yet not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question how much colour or white want you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select option reconstruct, you will get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be customized for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminanzine according to your taste. you will probably have to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digious; image processing. in order to keep the time for the demo type, you should go conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the part rock data that have many cameras, and that is known as a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digipB, and Dcraw, give you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation (variable number from gradient) was the first algorithm used by myself. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a gradient correction, since you are performed during the conversion conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">One profile translates the colour information and releases how they should be given back. there is also LCMS and & digious; information such as colour content of a colour space in the other are also translating colours as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour issues, when a picture is opened in image processing, the colour management module will start with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folders Send you the folder, such as / usr / share / color / user / .color / .color / .color / .color / .color; investigated this file then during start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the ability & quot; default squot; you can change your profile settings again when opening the blank file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures colouring not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to the camera head and model you can use. not all profiles are made on the same type. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain color mapping or gammakorifers. currently, dcraw Gamma is not necessary for converting at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options such as the Soft Proof profile, which allows you to emulate how your printer can work again from one device. this is very useful for your camera and some colors can be saturated. so instead you can manually scale it on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile is intended for them. unfortunately not in the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles to fit together. this answer is, of course, inofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profile extension makes the style of the goal: F for an accurate style, l for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plug-in interface. it is an interface that is supported by a set of & kde; image viewer and image processing is supported; many modules support to work with any program that supports KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you see a list of the available modules. select the modules that you want to use, and these will appear as new entries in the menu above the main window and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set manually in the menu under settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">Additional information (in English) via KIPI modules can be found via the KIPI project via the KIPI project via http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the Manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image passes, usually are 4-5 seconds well. the other check boxes activate the metadata in or out that appears at the lower end of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics show on the left side a list of all the time supported cameras. on the right side there is a button automatic detection, which is being connected to a camera that is properly connected, switched ON and in the screen mode. currently the port settings are supported here, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported here.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). this field is only active if you have a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera. you have to specify the path, / mnt / Camera or / mnt /, specify where you enter your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with digiplug, you need to connect the camera to your computer, and turn it in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check out if & digider, the camera automatically recognizes. if not, you can set camera body and port manually. once you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert it all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">You can view the dialog box dialog for the moving of &gt; images in the trash bin. when deleting a photos in an album, you can find further details when deleting a photos and deletion of an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes made by the right side bar can be used tacit by & digiplug; if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without relaping. otherwise you have to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also see the display of the splash screen of & digious; when starting, it accelerates the start-up of & digious.</seg>
<seg id="334">The Bm start looking for new photos is forcing & digious, looking for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time by & digider; if something from the base folder has been deleted, she asks if it wants to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemas can be used in & digious; in order to adapt the main window to your taste. you can select Preview Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digious; you will find further information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digipcase; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view and select your photos and the image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview menu and selection of the entry screen / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a range of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug; for example, you are not part of your distribution. further information about the KIPI modules can be found in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current filename, and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">One menu bar at the top edge and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing features will alter your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you use File Save or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you possibly can customize a copy of your picture before you change it. you can save it with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image again by using from the File Recovery or button The button Restore Reproduce in the toolbar. you will then lose any change which you've done using the photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Nearly every action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can undo or restored, by editing Edit restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you are using this frequently, you should turn to the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -z to reverse and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you want to press the & LMB; over the smoother or Restore button in the tool bar a moment longer press, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started playing image processing, you can choose between photos in the same album or the same keyword in the tool bar, image high, picture down or the entries in the menu file. if you want to make changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can in the photo set and out zoom in which you choose Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool bar or the entries in the applicant menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">In order to adjust a photo to the window size, you can choose this button in the tool bar: enlargement factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode. normally you come to the normal view in which you did not want the Esc key. normally you can edit it in the Settings dialog box & digious; you can also view this toolbar; main window. see the section for setting the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the actual picture, you can print out the menu of the menu and get the Standard & kde; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sets. all image examples are printed out of your selection. you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and import printer assistant. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digider, main window has a side bar at the right margin, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is also available, even in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same tab leaves the sidebar or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">In terms of writing, you can input or insert inscriptions with unlimited size or insert the note down. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all fonts are allowed to be used in EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that they can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII-characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all commentaries are cut off after 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC-labelling field in other applications, these restrictions should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented it, you either use the button user or switch to the next picture, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button, there is a button more. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. but you can also read the metadata into the files. but this will always be done if you've selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section rating shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars. it can be applied to the page bar with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the page bar or with the keyboard shortcut. to rate several pictures at the same time, choose them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field of gency. coding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The sampling point shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the sampling-tree and a selective box with the previously used in this & digious; meeting displayed.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is adjusted dynamically to the entered keyword. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is another relief in the input of entries with a series of images. if you have entered various keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate checkboxes in the tree. all words of an image are stored in the keyword in the IPTC box.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the whole selection, read the keyword filters section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filters are used to change the selection of the displayed pictures in the main window. usually, the left side bar with their album, - dates, query and search purposes will be used. if additionally one or more sample filters are displayed on the right side, all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop down. suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view. if the keyword is already existed, you can simply drag the right side bar and click on the selection. then, a dialog box you ask if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window lists the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is selected on no keywords, which were selected with Ctrl + a, and afterwards a keyword from the right keyword will be removed. a dialog appears whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes happens at every start of the program. it can also be switched on various settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created, and realize that it would be one or should be, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and the rules range.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can specify an extensive search for all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, you only need to check the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written primarily by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have been basically modified and modified.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you have a color managed workflow is that the colors of your camera or scanner will achieve a predictable deviation of the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a colorless workflow, you can easily print the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner or the colors you want to print out of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is coming to colour management, then everyone wants to know which buttons he would like to make for the results. unfortunately, the purpose of this tutorial is to give you adequate background information about colour management. in addition, you will make your own informed decisions that you get your own informed decisions that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If you comply with all six criteria listed below, you don't need to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are currently working on a monitor that has calibrated to the sRGB colour space (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other aspect expenditures are sent by e-mail or the Web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So, if sRGB works so well and that life is so easy for everybody, why should one use another color space and have to worry about colour management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colours we can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colours we can see, the hufeisenshaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour gamut, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour spaces, please visit Bruce Lindladoms Editor, and then click Info About RGB Working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to vibrate my monitor if I chose to work in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you have to use your monitor, as sRGB here is, so you have to use your monitor in sRGB, then you need to either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, using a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections to improve the image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting to further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, unequal, automatic and contrast extend from your colours the best. you will need to experiment the best with these effects. you will be experimenting with these effects to see which is best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method causes the magnification values beyond the whole picture, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point to change without its color shady. this function is often a magnetic correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same method adapts the brightness of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity of the intensity is as flat as possible. thus, nearly every brightness of the contrast is generated, sometimes it does not produce a very powerful operation, which causes either marvel at an image or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic waste: this method maximizes color area in red, green and blue channel. they determine the dark and bright border lines and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the brightness of the RGB value of a picture by moving the lowest and highest values on the widest possible range and a new jiustle of all values in between. this is only visible with balanced images and can be good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">Whitish effects of & digious, is a semi-automatic tool to implement white and white photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white unequal correction is somewhat limited because you can have a color space with 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, you can perform the tinting mode in the mode, so your possibilities are better than falling.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white background image protected by copyright Pawel T. Jochym. you can take it over the menu entry colors white and the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The showcase can be adjusted in size. on the left, both the original image as well as the preview of the target picture. the preview can be seen dynamically the shape of the tool. if you want to see the original protein content, it is enough to click the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminancy of pixels under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">A histogram appears on the right above, as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small Luminanzine values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown. the sum will be called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on the shade, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment allows you to improve or dimming the shadowls of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">Login with the aforementioned inspections, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then click anywhere on the image preview to calculate the color temperature of the white-off. on this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white ink with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The supersealding panel increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixels are overexposed. this will display the combined result in the white background. this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and loading make it exactly this. each setting of the white-file you have set you can save to a text file and load later again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets all filter values back to their default values and the related neutral white-comparison. note that even neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you store it your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the code depth in each color channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. this coding also needs more turntable, accountdown and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw material. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be done through the subwindow for the use of color profiles. a detailed guide for the use of colour profiles can be consulted in the chapter of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu below colors. this tool is an integrated path that allows you to adjust several color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always use the same error and therefore you always need the same correction. in the manual for audio corrections, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful opportunity to correct exposing problems is the tool for grit, that you can find gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digiplug case; tool color effects will provide you four color effects, a Velvia filter, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, even Sabatier, an effect that emerged after a partial pressure of a short lightning. the result was a partial negatively of the image. this tool was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar panel. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. finally, another increment produces that so is not to produce photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar power buffer. the original image is the (1) and the revised intensity (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that makes it a stronger contrasting effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. simply try to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an unusual painted colour film manufactured by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvia offers very satisfied colors in daylight and high contrasts. the Velvia offers very saturated color but also some photographer, especially those who underside the little landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light to the contrast channel. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the thickness of the Neonlight. with large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos. once you are satisfied with the results you are using the button Ok and you will be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you get a photo of bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem. even in this case the tool for brightness / saturation take a good choice to enhance the saturation. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple Leuchstrength / contrast / Gamma is the tool needed to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need for the purpose of the use only the range of slider. concrete the three slider below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window includes a graph of intensity levels, an histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graphs, three slider can be clicked into the picture, the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use is the controller to move and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the picture can be seen. preview is dynamically updated, based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set whether the histogram can be displayed with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear Histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic scale is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for dark tones used for light tones and the lowest for middle tones, frequently Gammader values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brush characters can be used in preview of the original image to adjust the inputs of the shade, medium and bright tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values are the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used here as well. the compression of output values can be used for example. the compression of output values can be used for this, a hidden picture can be seen as background while something else is foreseen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: using these buttons, the set values can be stored in the filesystem and reloaded later. in addition, Gimp's level format will be used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using this mode and three color pipettes, once you use the color pipette you want to use the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the Histogram program for red, green, blue and the Luminanzas.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option instructs allows all color channels to indicate overexposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator that means you can only see the effect in preview and no effect can be seen during the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the adjustment of the procedures applied to red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. previewing will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifying channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel which will be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between linear and logarithmic view. for pictures which have been recorded with a digital camera, linear mode is generated by a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps further.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a cranage right to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can corresponding that these bright tones are correspondent and the corresponding picture pixel are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos, a red marking is displayed. if you wish to change this marking on the curve, a matching line is shown on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can make exactly this. every curve that you created can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format is the Gimp course format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you make this method and the three color pipings create automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, central and solar tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Instructor option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is a indicator that means you can only see the effect in preview and no effect can be seen during the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo which was adjusted in the Luminanzcanal. shadow and solar tones were used with the color pipe and the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digider; image processing is a tool to enhance the color channels, or change the color shady of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another high-developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu-channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">Using the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram. this gives you a first hint as you can correct the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window shows a preview of. the original can be seen for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. when positioned this in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the respective color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulators for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels as well. if you also enable the option of monochrome, as the channel mixer is enabled to reduce the colour channel for creating great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color to a visible noise, which looks from the colour of color. if this is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Saving and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any mixer settings will allow you to save and then load. the file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option instructs allows all color channels to indicate overexposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator that means you can only see the effect in preview and no effect can be seen during the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re-adjusted. the original image is stored under (1) and the original image is shown below (1).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photograph was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photographs, black / white is a work step, because colour images can be easily converted to the machine. also with a set of film material profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford FP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good for all scenes and fits very well to portraits against the sky. thus, similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange film: simulates a black / white film exposing with an orange linter filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) oranges.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposing with a red linear filter. this creates dramatic ascension and can simulate scylients to the day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm light and medium tones while keeping a bit cold in the shade. this is very similar to the process of the lead and redevelopment in a sepsis. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similarly to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepharafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">When browned with the digious tool, you can apply decorative textures on one image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the carving of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of depth and tridimensionality of texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper reading effect was taken on the picture below. the original image is taken (1) and changed (1) and that changed under (2). the parameter relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the digiplug, tool frame, a decorative frame can be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Holding the eye of an obtainer in the boundaries of an photos is no easy task. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye. in the picture frame, the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you put the desired frame of the frame for your picture. with a thin line, down with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white pictures), grounded it with a nice three-dimensional setting. ideal for a bstone nail and decoration inserts a ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">That with the frame decorated with the frame image becomes greater than the original but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially when you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert easily a formatted text in a picture at any point. this goes well in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. the larger the image size must be adapted. the larger the image, the larger the character set must be adjusted. to the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting which you have chosen for your text can be changed, until you press the button "OK" after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With & digiplug, tool templates can be applied to a template on a template.</seg>
<seg id="470">The View Image template used in the image processing can be used to put templates on an image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For stencil there is no limitations regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file size and should be adding with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of the file size of the template; send you an e-mail in English to the & digiplug; mailing list digiplug-user @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to put your template-file with the button base folder in dialog. select the folder into which you have copied templates for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">Once the root folder has been set for templates, a build view is reflected in the folder structure of the template folder. the template's template is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons, which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the shown image. it is centered around the position of your mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Reduction: this button resides the lower picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template around the image, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image lying below. take the image and put it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template onto your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digider, three different tools are available for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpened is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">The sharpness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture of sharper. actually it's not a bit, it's been working rather psychological and it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Focus is perhaps the best of the three because it truly improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as the most digital images need a correcting of the sharpness. this is because the result of the digitization of colors must be combined with only minimal differences in colour. the same phenomenon can be seen when color highlights are printed on paper. SLR cameras will normally need more intolerant than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG image, the camera has often been applied to internal sharpening images. in contrast, images in the pipe format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner turn a sharpense filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness value, that can be viewed with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">With this, however, carefully handle it, since the results are not very natural: sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, you can find out more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too scarcely. the solution, which image is a little soft to draw. use the tool to draw a bit soft and experiment a bit with Settings. the showcase on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter favored masking is a very good tool for removing veils from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help process the image. the showcase shows the display of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two key parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values produce often good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius and the amount should be tested first. if you create the blurred mask, noise and the impression of grats are created near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels are affected by the filters on each side of the filters. high resolution images allow greater radii. they should be sharply sharply in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped picture added to the original. thereby, the strength of the sharpness is placed.</seg>
<seg id="494">The Corpora value is a fraction from the maximum RGB value and the apply difference result. this way, it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for a duct of the filters. in this way, areas with a soft change is excluded, and therefore mostly flawless in faces, celesting and water surface.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharply masking filter. the original picture is the (1) and the processed picture (2). insharply masking was applied with radius = 6.0, sum = 0.5 and a Corpora = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digider, tool Refocus translates a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the protected directory-design algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture & quot; refocsizing quot; in which it is a better way to sharpen the picture. it is better using a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. refocussing mostly achieved better results than insharply masking. you can start from the menu by pressing colours refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular flow works much better than the Gauß's Faltung. the GIR Wiener Inverse of Gauss, which is far from the original source, is influenced widely from the original pixels, even very strongly influenced by distant pixels. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular hot: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the main parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should set good results, but if your image should be very unsharp, but then on Heiligenreproach.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: there can help a correlation of correlation. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filters: an increase in the caterfilter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 but are rarely useful. if the noise filter is too low. a usable value is 0,03. a high value will continue to overwrite the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss'sche sharpness. this is the most common to avoid accidental radiance. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the caterfilter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation unit. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular hot or the Gauss's focus. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any re-focused parameter that you have set is stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all trimming, paint- and intensity classes on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before moving to the picture. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, eg; when JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masks produce better results as sharpness. this could be caused by sharpness that uses a large neighborhood as sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically you can always create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. the FIR Wiener filter is always at least as good as the Unsharpness Mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small, focused image, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour picture needs to be corrected. this picture was taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the focus on the sharpenal structure in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob has turned the sharpness of the area to be blacked out to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour ink enables a modified color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed mold to remove non-desired artifacts with unprecedented rate.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains several presets as starbase to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can do the tab for smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail preservicing p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to a smooth glass of smooth and smooth details. a value of 0.9% should be provided so that no sharpening should be incompatible. please note that the detailed maintenance is always subject to liability-dependent.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 in one direction. if you have a film meshing, a high value of wind generate similar patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed with a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. hence set this value to the level of sound in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects more structures. the higher this value is set, the more is needed, as it is difficult to estimate the image geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turmoence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns how often the algorithm is passed. usually here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular extent given [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected, it should also be small, so that small angle should be chosen a long runtime. thus, you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should avoid the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: the more quality you want through choice of this option is only low. it doubles but the runtime. we therefore recommend it to permit him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and loading make it exactly this. a text file can be stored in a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors correct is comparatively very fast at work. however, it may last very long to draw and a high CPU load after itself. you can therefore cancel the calculation anytime with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how imagery can be removed using little artifacts. the module is shown on a photo that was caused by an analog camera in Guatemala City. as you can see it is a unique black artifact that is causing the original picture below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digider, roughreduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool is available to remove stains and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens, it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Moireacute; effects from scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about the sensor noise of digital cameras, you can read these in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was done with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise which can be removed with this tool successfully.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you will need only the subwindow details and the advanced settings can remain at default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filters. large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can display the image and the color in it becomes smoother and thus smaller mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: determines the sharpness that determines the pixel pitch in front of the filter. if the value is increased, you may need to change the edges of the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details do not get more and noise or shame can occur again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: control the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not occur the whole catches or noise peaks. set it on a value near the maximum amount when you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts if you want to lose without details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: determines the luminance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change a picture. these attitudes do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controlled the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to enhance a picture. these attitudes do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker ranges, which are typically more rough, but it does not stain the shadow zones.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: determines the adjustment of phasenjitterdamping. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it is lifted up, the edges appear on the edges. it can remove rustle and phasenjitter on the edges. it can be loosening and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how the reduction of your lives can change. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected point with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. using the tool to draw a little soft so much easier than an image is using the menu entry and experiment with the glass door. the showcase on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">Die & digious; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter to restore gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undesirable artifacts, scratches, scratches, scratches, compression artefacts and local mistakes in digital, original, or later digitized images, thereby receiving the content as it also makes human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for paint- and texture rendering, using the text error correction. the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkrei and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas, it produces some compression & quot; artifact quot; - small standards that are shown in the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and loading make it exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last very long and a high CPU load after itself. you can therefore interrupt the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce how to reduce a photo with a visual noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a minolta (tm) 700Si camera to a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film version on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were reduced to an old colour photo taken with a scanner. you can see the scan-artifacts that are caused by scannerlighting and photo scanner. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digider, tool Hotpixel allows you to remove any photos with a CCD camera, eight were used. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are particularly a problem, because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixquot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image subtracing method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button Dark. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. they are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels using CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the right dark image to correct image. an automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixels. note that the assistant remembers the last nightfall and will automatically recharges in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview can help you correct the result. the display window displays the display of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all propositions.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durham: it is determined by average of the pixels. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for 1-dimensional interpolation it is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to polate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to polishing the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a gap of 3 or less are raised to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used for polishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, using a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">Die & digider, Vignetting correction is a tool for correct the Vignetting, i.e., exposed corners to correct an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the middle and large photo format, can often illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) they can reduce the edges and edges of the picture by reducing the light the sensor there. Teleobjective shows also this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, it also has disadvantages. many centers filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture table, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used, even with Center-filters, an opening from f / 16 or smaller, otherwise blurring effects arise through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large layer of exposure to current felt and paint- and colour printing from digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter by using a CenterFilter on an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers you can control the Vignetting correction filter, and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light weighting at the point of the biggest density. the standard density is 2.0, or at random an aperture level of 2, or random and increases the density to compensate a greater degree of Vignetting.</seg>
<seg id="572">Candlestrength, contrast and gamma-settings: the editing of an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the goal with these options, as you have to raise only positive values, since you only need to raise the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more sensitive new adjustment of the purpose of the target, let the values for brightness / contrast / Gamma arrive at zero and use the gradation from the & digious; image processing from the menu Colour Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction to apply to a picture. the original image (1) shows the correct picture. a amplification and contrasting correction was also performed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digiplug came, linear distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortions can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second ridge handles the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or confined form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect effect, flattens off the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth gravity corrects the remote corners to the second gravity. if you can combine these two geometrical distortion, almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of distortion second. with negative values can be corrected tonic distortion and positive values clowout distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion 4 Grades. this value acts stronger than in the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners parameters has the opposite sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scale the image size and thereby leads to the correct degree of gravity. negative values might increase during positive the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Clear: this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">In order to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview the distortion correction. the values you are using for your image are stored and used for the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tooth- respannular correction should be carried out before all trimming or size changes. the effect is best to cut and then perform a toothform correction, the effect of seemingly faltering.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to find you to view this tool a vertical and a horizontal support line. move it to an important place in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonic / hovered distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a hovered distortion, the resulting picture will correct black edges. you can remove them from image processing or zoom out of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the tone-shaped correction from the front is not enough. the next logical step for some motifs like photos from the front, frame and paintings are to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonic correction used to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the Gimpguru.org website under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 IInfrared film, see this URL. this movie has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left of the window you can select the area for preview. when you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below preview you can simulate two parameters for filming and film sensitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the fine texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of filming and the dominance of colour green (chlorophyll in nature) in converting. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter colour channels are mixed with infrared film, particularly the green channel makes no sense apply to black / white photos, as the colour information are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter model applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the original image was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate an art of aura at the top.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filter filming is an easy-to-use tool for reproduce film baskets as such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known to increase the sensitivity of the films that make the manufacturers big corpus of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmospheric gift from everyday life. if you want these special, gallery-like, tramway sight, especially in your monochromatic photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the knob, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to the control of the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, if you still need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of a filenoid effect applied to a black / white image. the original picture is the (1) and that worked (2) for the used film hypersensitivity to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The digiroll came; filter oil paintings produced the appearance of an oil paintings. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The digiplug, filter oil paintings, gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural images and stylistic life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs to influence this effect. the upper selects the size of the brush between one and five. thick brushes are better suited for large images. smooth the smoothing or, from the other side, the hinderness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil paintings effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the coworked is marked with the (2) brush size for this 640 pixels wide image is 1 and smoothte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">Der & digious, filter coal record uses paint- and intensity gradients in order to define an carbonic effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you could have chosen to sketch yourself. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the output filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default values of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug painted the filter engraving your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a protected algorithm created by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure, in which colour is not the most important content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, mondarous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth also allows the contrast to the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the revised image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter assembly you can transform a normal picture into a work of art by distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wavelength 1: divide the image into cells and makes it look like if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft 2: similar to the wavelength 1 the image will be distorted here with a different version of glassblocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can always break these effects anytime with the button end.</seg>
<seg id="614">This filter assembly allows you to transform a normal picture into a work of art by means of tradefensive effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom in blest: caught the image along busy lines that run from a center. this simulates the immeasurred camera and thus produces a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radially Unsharpness: caught the image by rotating the pixels to a focus. this simulates the immeasurbility of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Range of distance: explodes the picture to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to come back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion sharpness: caught the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the immeasurbility of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographic photo, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softly sharpness: caught the image soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this is ideal to create romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schütting sharpness: explores the image by a random shift in pixels and simulates the imminent of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpness: find the basin in the picture and exploit the rest without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel rate.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can therefore interrupt this calculation at any time.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice little tool to make regentroping on your image. this makes it natural your images a wet look. it uses a pieter Voloshyn protected by copyright.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size allowed it to change the size of the drop. because the sample size is not automatically added with the size of the image, it often changes the size and density of droplets. number changes the optical effect of the drop in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digider; image processing a range free of raindrops. to do so, use the range tool in order to remain free. if you start following the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of a regentroped filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the converted picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can flip it by mirrors or spin the right orientation. the tools you can find in the menu Transforming Changing or Transing Each Other.</seg>
<seg id="629">Foto-inflating is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo in a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is simple. the big question is, how can you get a picture of inflating or guess the details? how can you render the missing information re-invent or guess? the CImg algorithm is used here, make it a good job. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. choose a shift size change in the menu and type the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, then try the inflating tool.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation to enlarge an image. & digious, uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Correct aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the new size is maintained in the original image of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects more structures. the higher this value is set, the more is needed, as it is difficult to estimate the image geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turmoence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and store are used exactly along with that. any insertion for photo can be stored as text file and downloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very quick in what it does, but it can still last very long and a high CPU load after itself. you can stop the calculation anytime with the button end.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of a picture on the picture, by increasing a small color picture to the double size. the original (1) and the enlarged image (2) is the result of linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a commonly conducted operation, but also a frequently underrated tool to compose a picture. the image cleanup simply allows you to create a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and ascending the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut out. this allows you to make a good overview of your photo by drawing. a new rectangle makes you create a new rectangle by moving it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting button, use the button Der pluck button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl + + X). use the entries file storage or file storing under the menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the screening area you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool In case of aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as high-format or landscape aspect. in the aspect ratio the greater value of the height and in the transverse format is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool is using a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same as you can use centimetres, Inch or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional profiles for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons to select the selection can be centered horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Bottom in the dialog you can set with the Max ratio button to cut the range into the maximum possible, depending on selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool is based on an aspect ratio, depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). the revised image measurements are stored in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut picture and do not represent the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The attitudes of coaster help enable help to hide your pictures in better shape. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic submissions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third party, harmonic triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden middle is a pitch the spread to various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of Nautilus mussel or the leaf leaves of a sunflower. it dives into all possible things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrationale number 1,618033988... and you have already used the golden partition in all times when you build your temples and pyramids in all times when you put your paintings, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the standing part is equal to 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that is normally follows as a visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle represents liquid auxiliary lines when you encounter a picture. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your first pics. in comparison to the third-sail gel the golden spiral has a liquid line of the eye can follow through the image. this type of composition leads the view of the spiral along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric course on this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangle. this rectangles are used to direct the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this something can be simply because of being without the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also shifting from the above-mentioned golden spiral. their vertices are the main points of the sides of the golden rectangle. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no uniformative triangles. diagonal to place on these lines can be seen a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use Golden Triangle to set your frame around you create an effect of wrap-like dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus at one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition you can't reach.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal and vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonious particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image of any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it's easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with the Free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the button preferences you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help the module is available a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to move the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the image you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture, you will find unwanted dirty holes in the corners. one way to repair it, it is possible to utilize the transition from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is Automatic crop. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">Option Anti-aliasing spares the picture a bit after rotation. but please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All spectrtivic transformations are carried out to a fixed point of the reference point. this point is depicted in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture. the preview will then be automatically created. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information that help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including empty areas which are formed by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including empty areas which are formed by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left edge of the connected area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right up: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed loop.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left edge of the connected area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed loop.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit polluted. for a single adaptation this effect is small but two customizations produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you unfit the prospect you will get unpleasing triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it, it is the image with transformers cutting off from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The scoring die is used to move part of the picture in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. this is no rotation, the picture will be distorted. with other words, a rectangle will be converted into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical corners. if you press preferences, the angles are set to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target are displayed on the right of the sight.</seg>
<seg id="680">After your help, a vertical and a horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point as e.g. the lake to fix a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to adjust the lines to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the lock, the picture gets a bit wiped. for a single shear, this effect is mostly negligibly, but two chings should avoid twice as much wrestation and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After etching the picture has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate these, it is the image with transformers cutting off from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digious, requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write captions. the available formats are therefore compiled by your system and, in some cases, from the way like those libraries compile were compiled. in most distributions, you can edit a large number of image formats with & digious;</seg>

<seg id="728">Integration in & Kate; and & Konqueror; (leaving a change in the graph; the graphs newly calculates and in & kgraphviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & Kate; to open or the graph in & kgraphviewer; in a & Kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Download large graphs (currently there are problems starting at around 1000 nodes and a hack to show more than this nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphviewer; is a & kde; program that requires the & graph; -tool & dot; for representing the graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graph, every in one's own window. in the beginning, when you start & kgraphviewer; in this case the tool bar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list of last open files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; files selected, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed location of this overview or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zoom is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file has been changed in & kgraphviewer; loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will display:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph will be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. & kgraphviewer; if you want to change the change, you may change your choice later. if you want to change your decision later, set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph outside of a running & kgraphviewer; instance, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphviewer; -instance, or want to display the display in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can open all the graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph will be split to several sites. the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using several sites, you can select whether the parts of the graph, which are to be placed on this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Side preview with one on several pages distributed in the graph without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The page again gives the option to specify the behavior if a file has been changed on the hard disk, eg. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or program the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The page opening is the ability to specify the behaviour of & kgraphviewer; you can specify a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or specify in a subwindow of the already running session) or specify that each time will be asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The seat management page provides the possibility to specify the start behavior of & kgraphviewer; you can specify a default behavior (open or not) or specify the files of the last session.</seg>
<seg id="748">Context menu, which is usually open for one click in the main window with the & RMBs; it opens further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among various & graphviz; - Layoutbox; select entries as described on the website of & graphviz; are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for layered graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of layered graphs. the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and tries to produce a few edges as possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for undirectional graphs. it produces representation in accordance with the springtime model. thereby the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, the same is equivalent to statistic multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates for unstratified graph a springboard model. it uses the Fruit-Reinhardt Heuristics and includes a multi-fire trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm rearranges the knots of circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a Layoutfile, which will then be specified by a shell. the command should give the graphic design as parameters, and the calculated layout of the graph can provide special options, or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of the graph (fixed or unlayered) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for stratified graph).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview is displayed if necessary. otherwise it does not appear and the positioning menu will be inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Displays the -mouse pointer at. click on a & GUI; item to get further help to this element (if available).</seg>
<seg id="758">A list of changes is available at this address and in the file Changelog in the root folder of the source archive.</seg>
<seg id="759">& kgraphviewer; is a & kde; program that uses & graphviz; tools to display. it requires the following programme:</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. the geographic data are stored in the EXIF keyword of the image and the localization can be displayed in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools for localize images of geographic in spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo will be localised. height, longitude and latitudinal modes are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in GPX format. GPSBabel and gpsone can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears. to upload a possible correlation between time and localization, this file also contains the same time to the same places as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded automatically, the coordinates will be displayed in red. GPS Spider data is recorded in GMT time and therefore, the camera power will be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum deviation for the maximum time variance indicates a maximum deviation for the GPS time and camera power. is the deviation below the data collected. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have a track data of a place for pictures you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the images. the difference of 2000 seconds will correlate to all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The Interpolishing and the difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data. if you know that in reality a location in a large timdifference between Camera and GPS is, you can set these borders here and then correlate to the button.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually in this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place. as the dialog box itself, you only need to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. then choose the relevant region and increase it again, until you have reached an adequate accuracy. the height can always be manually set. the map can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to put GPS data to the images. here's a small script that the exiftool is used to create a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool in order to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums which are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will be encoded as UTF-8, to allow for best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four Reiter where the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed in a hierarchy. in the area below the Albenpreview and the text that appears in the head of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this rider is largely unexplained to each page. if you then click on a page, a new page is opened in which the image will appear in the image. otherwise, the picture will appear directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings and how to store the gallery with all your related images. select a folder where you have written permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything you will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG format, EXIF data of your original pictures are also stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other colour depth you can change the default color depth. this also influences the file size. all other settings are explained by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab thumbnails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the rider tab for the thumbnails, which are small images shown in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window indicates the user at how far the action is. press downbreak to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has generated pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the programs in order to verify that error during the production. the web browser will automatically start to preview the preview. click Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and implement base operations such as speeds, zoom or shifts. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it was developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG-free module is a tool to impair images without impairing your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module permits the files listed below to save images in JPEG format, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss of loss is it that is increasing the file size since no compression of colour information is place. this is possible, e.g. in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client has not currently any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of KIPI Team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI Module Metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the Mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org by the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of metadata model, you can copy data from one picture to another. in order to copy the image dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will copied by clicking on the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not into any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please check EXiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG coding module is a tool for converting a series of images to a MPEG video in form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Kodierer can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG-Video, using a defined length, using the packets Mjpegtools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically for the chosen video format. in addition, you can choose a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats of DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the media you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the pictures that will be packed in the MPEG Diaschau. afterwards, you can create the module for extras MPEG diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you select will then be listed in the Portfolio section. you can also sort the images or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. the video format may be chosen from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and NTSC. PAL is preset, most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should indicate the time in seconds. the speed of the picture above is specified below. a lower value produces very sudden, a high contrast very smooth.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. in case of doubt, you can specify the name and path of the created file. keep the extension mpg if possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have all settings adapted to your needs, you can then go fast or in all peace and enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the Mjpegtools and ImageMagick packages on the button settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">Print assistant allows you to print multiple images on one sheet of paper together in standard print sizes. the combined images can also automatically be opened with the image processing The Gimp is: for example, to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM formats.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. you don't expect it from dcraw to get the same results as the software from your camera maker. sometimes you get better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, choose the RAW file to be converted and run the module. the Raw image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values again to optimize the conversion process. the first option is to adjust the camera values for the white background. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrasting information. if your camera is working in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and the file extension is equal to. JPEG uses a funny algorithm and is produced for the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The privacy image format, TIFF, reserves all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you proceed to process your pictures frequently or later, you should not choose to use the JPEG format, since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adjusted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that are included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting the conversion. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use playback.</seg>
<seg id="863">The pile processing mode allows you to convert various images at once. use this mode therefore if you are safe, e.g. by testing at a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to version for individual images. however, they have the possibility to write the existing file automatically. this is helpful if they have been generated in an earlier attempt. a preview is however not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. use the tool convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can enlarge the image and enlarge it. in addition, four kinds of image changes are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in dimension. the width or height of the picture is automatically selected, depending on the picture orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt to your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: non-proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparations: prepare the image for photo print. the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background dimensions, boundary and background colour, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send chosen pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to modify the size of the added images in advance. more pictures can be submitted to the list of images submitted.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the pictures window will display the thumbnails displayed by you. you can add additional images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image a preview on the right side will appear.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop pictures to the picture list and add the list of images to be used.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images you will remove the selected pictures from the list of images added.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can open the New message box of your E-mail client with the button OK. you just have to add the addresses and subject to the subject. the images you select from you are attached as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't hesitate to ship too many pictures at one time. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending e-mails. there might be a good idea to send several mails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The E-Mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used every time until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">In case you are using the Google mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">Following the selection of comments in a attached file, the comments will be added to the images in a text file and included mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu item File Format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files, but it is best to use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG, select file format and the original files in JPEG format are added, then the original Exifs will be added to the images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down when looking for errors, however. your e-mail program will start automatically at the end. with the button closing, you can shly this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions like you wish to have presented your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions in the presentation are using very elegant images via OpenGL, but you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option ensures that the filename of images will appear in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an end loop. then you can manually break it with the Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images random option ensures that the images are shown in a random sequence. so, not the order of pictures in the album is used.</seg>
<seg id="890">Below delaying between pictures, the temporary distance between each pictures can be set between 1.5 seconds and a good value. the best distance depends however on your computer and the chosen transition effect. you should know this to show your friends presentation!</seg>

<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, screen photos and introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphoto album; and choose the Demo, if you start & kphoto album; for the first time, or select a photo album in the menu. after that, some example images are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, please visit the & kphotoalbum homepage; as a related HTML document for downloading.</seg>

<seg id="917">& photo album; presented to you two possibilities available to create HTML pages with your images. the one is written in & kphotoalbum; built in & kphotoalbum; built in the following part of the user manual, which allows you to create... query the menu file HTML... query.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and finish. in the following, any area will be described.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the contents and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on a photo album; HTML example, see an example for these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a & kphoto album; -Export file is to be created on the reviews page. transfer information about the export-files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages. as such, you can avoid that information is displayed by a party. for example, all pictures of a party are available. note that this setting is therefore not available to hide certain images from certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can define how the HTML pages are to look like. most settings are clear, which is why they are not specially made.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this allows you to have a monitor and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600, no images will download the resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the resolution at any time. so he can browse your pictures with low resolution, which results in a slower transmission time. if it is shown to be larger, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, choose a base folder for all your HTML files, and a new subfolder for each subsequent sentence.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the root folder where all of your images will be stored. this folder will be saved and the next time will be automatically added. this folder will enable you to select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if this is really all available for the viewer. once you have created a web browser after the pages have been created, the URL you need here should be. otherwise, the web browser should start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files are not yet created in the final target folder, you will need to manually copy it into the final target folder. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base file in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The options described above have changed all three to basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you can define in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking for a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you may have a lot of time to look at the pictures, on the pictures, capture, etc., then you have to do with & kphoto album; they do not have to do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphoto album; you can export a copy of your pictures to a .kim file. these can import and imported others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they are certain whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is stored in the file, that you can have all the images in the file and that file is so independent of it. the obvious drawback is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file directly from the menu File Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches for the images in a two-way file. first, the images are found in the .kim file format, so the images of the URL you have entered when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images are described, which you can export about the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The main option of this dialog is whether to act internal or external .kim files. there are the following three choices available to you:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the manually copy option to the .kim file, you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Using the Automatically copy the .kim file to the .kim file and copy the photo album automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is usually not very small, but if you want to compress this, simply select the Export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page contains Maximum image size limit. if you would like to send your friends pictures, since the .kim file would be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu File Import menu, becomes & kphoto album; the exported database as described in described file.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, after, in which folders will import images to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category People who is to be imported (if you are a Dane), while this category is asked in the third dialog window, which will be imported into the categories of the imported file and which categories they are listed in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can select the categories of the present file with the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: if you look at images you often want to view images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the various steps from (1) fixed the information about your pictures, over (2) passing through and see through (3) advanced themes and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it was extended and today your videos have spoken. many places in this manual will talk about images, but often do not include videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photo album; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the uppermost folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can copy to a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy, or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphoto album; remember the folder where your images are stored and used this with future Starts. if you once want to start a different database tree with images, you can start & kphoto album; with the -c option. as an example: photo album -c ~ / company / photo / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Set up the menu entry Settings; set up to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of user manual, you will be explained the various options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, which allows you to view the preview options and options for the viewer. for each setting, an exhaustive help is available, which you can call from the button on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described to you as you can set for any picture different properties, e.g. persons, locations and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set complete member groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group will be set up in a group instead of all groups of a central member.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the possibilities you can choose to set the list of members. with the listed selection list you can select the category you want to configure. in the left panel you find a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photo album; shares his modular system with other graphics applications such as digiplug and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; image plug-in interface. night information on this webpage by Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called modules over the menu. the modules can and are not described in this handbook, as they are not sold and sold separately. however, most modules have a help page that you can call over the modules.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with multiple applications, it may be that the modules are tested with & kphoto album; for this reason, you should always test them with the demo database, using the command line &gt; kphotoalbum\ &gt; or via the Help menu. do not say, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI, are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphoto album; do not work. this is the downside if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphoto album; and other applications that also can use KIPI, is that the other applications include their images in albums. even if & kphoto album, this kind of order does not support for some modules, so you can simulate the functions with & photo album;</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & photo album; the current album, which is simply the current view, i.e. all pictures that show you the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album & kphoto album; the modules also have a list of albums. here is the & photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphoto album; s Browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category you specified in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums, and if you choose the category people, will do & kphoto album; so if you would have selected people on view and share this on the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphoto album; not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules. start the Settings dialog, and select the modules that are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">The picture shows an example for a home screen when you start & kphoto album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are familiar with any other KDE key you can see at the top one menu and a tool bar. currently, you will not find a lot of information about the tool. currently, in the section, we will not display any information about your pictures, but now please click on the pictures below to show you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the opportunity to see each image of the image, which has been taken on the picture, where the image was taken either individually or for a larger number of images during the same time. if, for example, on all images of Jesper and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want to see this comment if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view of three lists with a text box by allowing people to set locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you are always using information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based upon the move of images within the list: if you are mapped to the example of a family celebration and above all 50 pictures, the same 5-10 people can be moved, so they can be moved closer and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get a alphabetical list of sorted, click on the symbol for sorting on the list below.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you may wish to edit all the selected pictures and make these pictures with annotations. in this case, click the front and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it may be more comfortable to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. they are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the United States as a group. to show you that it is a special group, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the program you can add an entry to an existing or new subtype or subcategory. in addition, you can also take an entry to a category and put it in order to make this entry into a subcategory. attention, this assumes that you can sort your categories in alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the program by clicking the bar that form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a window in the frame by drag it outside of the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button Options... that allows you to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also send a frame completely out. if you want to see this window again later, use the button Options... and click here to view window. see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you get an overview with thumbnails of currently selected images, or all images if you do not have filters. for example, you can configure the thumbnails, by simply drag the mouse, with the middle mouse button, try.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture will be used as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, this is displayed in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with a picture viewer, a new display window is created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture preview. just select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete and press the Edit menu. now the window will display you see in the Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photo album; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use & kphoto album; you can also use pictures anywhere in the database. of course, you have to upload images anywhere, that you can view the pictures from anywhere in the database. in the picture you can view the View of & kphotoalbum; when not all needed pictures from the hard disk can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures where the right corner is cut off, not stored on the hard disk. this is, for example, to view the images 1-9. however, the thumbnails appear on the images 1-9. however, you can view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this function, you need to copy files from folders, and re-copying them. & kphoto album; it's not necessary to avoid the insert of the associated CD, so please purchase a bigger hard drive to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Edit menu you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to make a little more privacy, you can filter out the pictures that you can see for others unaccessible. alternatively, you can also see all the images that your little sister may see, tick and select the menu items all except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to set the pictures in the case of the case. if you enter the laptop now your small sister, you simply select the menu entry images that you are locked up, click on lock and lift up the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password change in menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is not very safe. for one, all images on the hard disk and the other can read out or delete the password as unencrypted text. this kind of password protection is only for those who are familiar with & kphoto album; not very familiar to those looking at private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to describe all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; of course, you want to describe them. for this reason you want to look at some point. for this reason you have to look at some pictures. this is why you can preview them as described.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course it shows the picture, but additional all the information that you have given through the image, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">In case you want to see the InfoBox on top of the picture you want to see them easily and elsewhere. you can also configure the information displayed by clicking on the viewer. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see, matching entries to this. when you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Suppene. as if you selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene selected.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loads of multiple pictures in the viewer, you can use between them and return, by pressing the keys picture above and below. you can reach the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple pictures are loaded at the viewer, you can then run them as slide show. & kphoto album; just download a new image after a few seconds. how often it can press a new image by pressing the Ctrl key and Plus or minus the button Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of looking & photo album; to change it in full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. just use the input button to switch back in full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can put in the image and zoom out. to heralate you can zoom out a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button you can zoom out again. shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not shown with zooming. with the equal amount of the zooms, so that every pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations work with videos that are in and out with the Pluspartner and Minustaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the context functions of the context menu, you can turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes about the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you view images you can see a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. in the moment you can view the view and configuration dialog of the picture to enter this name. however, you will perhaps adopt the image to mark and see further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to see the photos on paper. to see which photos you want to start the viewer and mark them as good or badly, as you can watch one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features, while you can view them. features include the letters A to Z and you can make a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters. in the event you see an image where features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have any features on your pictures, they are available to you in your browser. so you can see all the images you want to edit, print or whatever you want. this is described in one module to copy the selected pictures to a CD or whatever you want to make.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview pane. if you can view categories in Dre feeding view, then simply press the characters for the feature, after the image was chosen. this can be seen here:</seg>

<seg id="1010">The painted is not saved with the image, but in the database. you can undo your own later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In this way you can see a picture on the painting. to shift the painting from & kphotoalbum; select on the picture draw on the panel. simply press the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that recognizes the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map map size you can enter the width and height of the fairer image. if you want to render only one small area of the image, choose the check field subsection and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality you can select the properties that use & Povray; for rendering, this is done by a very simple paint- and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of Render properties can be found in the user manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered by only a beam per pixel, various errors may occur. these images are often not displayed in a Moironic pattern or stage effects in curves and lines, but details are sometimes not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property see better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on Anti-aliasing, and connects & Povray; more than a jet per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adapting the second method is adaptive-recursively, recursively, because every pixel is broken up and adaptive because the reclaiming of the calculated color depends.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray runs a ray per pixel. if you adjust the values between the color values to the next number of pixels, a grid of 4x4 added value is calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values indicate the specified threshold, the pixels are divided into 4 sub-pixels, which can be examined individually and to further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be determined by lowering.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called jittering. if you switch jittering, changes & Povray; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The latest setting for the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; which is diffuse reflection reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent, if the associated rays have no object.</seg>

<seg id="1055">Currently & kpovmodeler; does not yet support the full command set of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window lists a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source code for & Povray; this adds to the source code in the original text file in the Editor, simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it to the slide tree.</seg>

<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points on the grid-context menu of the wire model. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more specific wire model and thus a better wetsuit for the displayed objects but require more time to rendering. for some objects like the sphere you can set the detailed mode for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross High Tasks for advanced projections, all wire model views are further divided, if the camera uses an advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature yields a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick a wall, a wall is framed behind the objects. the wall is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the floor, dot the floor below the objects. the bottom is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick your cancerative antialiasing method, the non-recursive antialiasing method for rendering scenes is used. the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted. in section Render modes you will find more accurate information.</seg>

<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start out with more precise knowledge of both programs. if you can build all steps in this manual, you should get the ultimate in simple scene where beginners can get very popular: one bullet on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings exactly before you complain about a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, do not apply rules for rendering, as a result you will receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not include light sources, your whole scene is dark and you'll just receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything faultless, see the first Start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window commands:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their usage.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to remove this guide, first you must remove all objects from the object tree. then select the scene and then select the menu entry collection. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you produce. in particular, the view of the scene is seen from the view of the camera. this shows you the view of the Renderns scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found. in the user documentation zu & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change anything in the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved later on the basic settings of the camera, but you can change the camera in view Control points, with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a check point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button user or the space bar, change the wire model views and the object tree immediately accordingly to these settings. as a result they see here the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could set out a box (Insert serial Body Quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a controversial method for resolving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and then press the button design or the space bar. in the object tree the new name will be shown immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view also shows the level, even if at the moment, only then a limited plane. when you render the scene, the layer extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you view the object tree exactly, you will find that you can see the entry for the ground if you click on the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will find the different parameters for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. choose one of these options, also change the possible settings in the object properties view.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit among the horizontal lines, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose a shift and set the values like this:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select a few times at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog box opens in which you can select as the object is to be inserted. please choose the name in the object tree (name = ground-pigments), with a click on the button preview it looks like the pigment now looks like.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments should only be a material black material, because you can still type settings for pigments anytime with a click on preview. again, you can now find the colors for the pigments. again, there are many options, but now take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not preview color on Quader and ball, click on the button Apply button and then go to preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should receive the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color scheme you have expected. here you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then select this entry twice (you can do this as well, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select it in the object tree any time and change the colors in the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be able to simply perform this step, since you have already understood the fundamental work of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the space bar or button to press), so the ball must move over the floor as you have moved the floor around a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now yields a strange result: as already shown before, the globular surface looks like a material black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Once you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already at the ground, type a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose first object and change the name for example in sphere pigments. click on the sphere of pigments, select the color and set the values like this:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take time, add some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen shots and click on the user or push the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already produce good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not even chosen:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of which possibilities you & kpovmodeler; I hope you've already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a sequel method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you are raytracing, the Renderer hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders scenes) through every pixel within the scene, and how atmospheric effects of light sources are reflected in the scene, and how atmospheric effects work like mists. thus, the scene files are processed for pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see without a camera, the camera is your eye when you see the scene. without a light source you see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. POVRAY files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & K3b. here, general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & K3b should work out. this dialogue is intended for personalization and for the definition of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is, like many other & kde applications, also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; you can use either the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functional scope, therefore, your taste and type of your task is crucial if you specify the default program you have.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we will use that you can use the command line program dcop. to make sure you have the command line program dcop. you must first make sure that & K3b; then you specify something like the following one:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; program reported, supports & K3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & K3b; provides functions like copyCD, format DVD and other functions for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovix DVDProject () DCOPref currentProject () void copyDvd () void copyDvd () void copyDvd () void frame Dvd () void frame Dvd () void burncdImage () void burncdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one can get a reference to the newly created project: DCOPref (K3b, K3b --audiocd) and then a reference to the project via # dcop K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b Interface currentProject This reference is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data-projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createways (Qstring name) void createways (Qstring name, Qstring parent) void addUrl (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, Qstring newname) void set volume ID (Qstring path)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / Bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3b createc) dcop $PROJECT createzothe foo dcop $PROJECT of createc / home / trustee.txt / foo / bar</seg>

<seg id="1495">& kaudioAn; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard disk) and from many coders to encode these WAV files (lossless packages). more coherders may still be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the tracks of the & CD are read and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per track) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & kaudioilei.cdparanoia. almost any distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this has not yet been installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggprebis (for OGG) or other coherons are already installed, it is very likely not necessary to compile any other Linux distributions, but only the Kodiers will need to be used. if FLAC is not used, the installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to coders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already mentioned, use & kaudioileic. this program is not provided to read any copy protection, it is not possible to read a protected audio CD. in any case, it is not possible to avoid the copy of copy protection. just avoid buying the copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup dialog has to be performed only once (the setup dialog it is possible), following the daily use of a & CD. this leads (hopefully) for understanding the slim approach of the user interface, via which you will stumble on the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can be converted to many formats - depending on which coding times are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can print & CD; retrieve information from the FreeDB file or works entirely without network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step example, further information, such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB inquiry on the CD data according to the setup of inquiry in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, the latter case must first be connected to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">To start reading and - if an encoder is configured in the alignment settings in the setup dalogue - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available Encoder, so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. it is said to have previously configured in the encoder card settings in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already read file is selected to encode instead of a full & CD. read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages (such as protocols, beeps) for program events (such as reading the & CD; terminates).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudioAn; with different card cards (like Encoder, for arranging the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter covers audio quality, coders and compression rates and helps you with choosing the correct Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If there are no audio information to be lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are other like 'shorts' or 'monkey' which may be available for this distribution. the advantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">In the audio formats that lose information from data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may present a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrate (up to 128 kbps), but the differences will produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality in deeper bit rates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music will be heard from a computer or machine based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special Auto-Stereo system. today - at the beginning of 2009, these devices usually support only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and subsequent compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset" standard '= This setting is usually acceptable for most people and most unacceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset Extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex plays of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approximately 11. 128 kbps for all tracks of a title. good enough for music by young people, portable devices and car circuit systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information which is pressed manually or through the program is automatically fetched from the FreeDB, are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be delivered with & kaudioset; and the code-file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with codification programs, there are often a combination of programming settings for the coders and these parameters. the manual or the help of the codiles explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add CD titles; titles be added to the keywords (English: day) when MP3s with lame are encoded with lame and the title parameter of & kaudioset; the result looks like this: '-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioAn; parameters that can be used (= button name in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDB is: a free database, where people can read / enter the information, instead of charging the information instead of yourself in the calculator. it's worth noting that here only the text is spoken: & CD; titles, artists, names, etc., not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal but I (CEO of the ureter) I am not a lawyer. however, no one can fix it from the & CD; more or less worthless, so can't be added to the artist nor the music business. any information can be received anyway on a bumble through a & CD; shop, physical or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioader; it is actively used to check the check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address will not be used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer that has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudioader; when using FreeDB, the geographic on the next mirror directory will be needed. this saves a bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org delivers a current list of mirror servers for the online pick-up of & CD; information during read a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) just the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which program is used to play pieces from the & CD; stored in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia would be used to read it in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see that the cdparanoia package must first be installed first if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the read out WAV files, the Kodierer and thus the desired file format will be chosen. in the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) will be added to the Code tab on this tab. other Kodiers can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the affected Linux distribution before the code is used. this is also necessary for the predefined code. further information on codiers are found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers, further information about his switch can be received by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). thereby 'lame "must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check out the device number of & CD; / DVD disk, the write and reading right of your choice (lame for MP3s, ogloc for OGGs, flac & etc.), try to open both programs with a command line in a terminal. this might be something wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the CD, and this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for example. even if you are using other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, but are all understood, but are somehow still not sure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set out those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, print everything and use our first & CD. we'll use lame '--preset extreme 'to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled package for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd contains and that you have screaming to copy it (eg; by trying to copy it up with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers basic set-up of & kaudioAn; something that is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the use of the coding of music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset Extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps), where the files are used, we share the program using the FreeDB file to load the files from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them with any reading & CD, once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is given to the reading program that can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the true device of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt on the existing entries of the device names for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The box card General Settings. here are not much to do. here, an additional conversion will be defined. in our example everything is so offsetting / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, so that you will be informed if data are sent to the creation of keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The CD card settings. simply select both entries, we are convenient and let the & CD be downloaded automatically over the Internet from a FreeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be connected to the FreeDB server using the internet, so it can be connected to the FreeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, becomes an & CD; associated entry begins immediately the reading name / name. this is slightly modified with the database entry and the filename file names and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; for day use.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to manually enter all the select fields and FreeDB, you will be able to download it twice in Offline mode. however, this is more than 620 MB in open mode. however, these have to be selected twice in the offline mode, at least the first one. mode will be set up on the following card map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is FreeDB for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the CDDB server via the Internet. how does the system know which data is to be received from the FreeDB server? read the section on FreeDB. make sure it's shown in the screenshot above.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org site and look after a mirror server in your area. on this way, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will however work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work as equivalent to the server, as many firewalls require the protocol 8880 as standard, there might be more fortunate with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit any CD; data to the FreeDB server. disable the first check box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screen saver. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously literating pieces: excuse, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? read and code? the author doesn't know it, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last unit, cross it around the & CD; throw at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this one, then / or the path can be stored in which the WAV files are installed. this folder will not be enabled, if you do not want to do this folder when you want to do something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything will be given as it is shown on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under the circumstances something to be flipping over to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as already mentioned, the resulting bitrate is sufficient for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the resulting compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Notice the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of creating tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent "id3 'for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Keep the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">The number of WAV files simultaneously to be encoded with dual core or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be attempted to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1574">In this section is described as described in the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure, which is done on the hard disk, was developed in the previous section as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will be described. the process of data is described in this section must be repeated for each read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not included in FreeDB, screen photos will see a little different from the data base for one & CD; you will learn how to get data manually from the Internet. you will get the data manually from the Internet. comments will be shown on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, the & CD now has to be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window, as shown in the screenshot. this only if the & CD can be identified as audio CD; and from cdparanoia can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers about the help or go back to the previous section of the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD was picked up, all titles of the artist are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; gives a window appears, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best suited to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't have the check box for the automatic query by FreeDB (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for Settings), you can manually trigger it manually from the choice of the first button, but you do not need local database, but you need access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2-step 02: the CD editor - input of CD data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD, according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field ', the rest of the data in the input field' Album '.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be given out more in the input field 'Current Title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments in a single piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful recall of the data from the FreeDB file, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor, so that you can not only start with the artist and album title, but also to check if there are any unwanted Remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field. this option is allowed to set up the values of ID3v2 tags; this option will be shown at the Code of KodiererSettings; please refer to the section 'Basic Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You may change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codes or file formats. see Help on the Kodierer after receiving more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry, obviously with the style of the trigger CD; right. in this example, this is not important, since we do not transmit the & CD; for further information go to the website of Friedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editors appears again and you see that the fields are filled with the entered data, which we have already recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. add the title of the piece to any case and other information that you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered any title data on the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the FreeDB file. it is already sorted into one of these categories of database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown on the track list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the tracks which are selected will be selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the play, or manually select the box on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection out of the reading process was started, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and track what runs.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab on the tab on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will you see if you are trying to work with a coding which you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked the write access to the files for temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first volume.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. to read out and encode parallel. note the stats in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration possible to suppress this behavior. the only one that seems configurable is the result of reading and code. with high-performance machines, the result is unclear. the used machine with an AMD64 seems to have no problem while simultaneously reading and code (from two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue. after the last piece is codified, a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioster;, you need & kde; 3.x. resp. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the coding of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is directed to individuals that are compiled by source files, and not for users who use a precompiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adjusted to your needs if it runs once, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls for many different programs, has many variations of settings. at best, read the step for step example to get to know the options and settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still read more? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first-time start of the program, without any clue to go from this somehow empty screen (especially if at the time of program start no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it? who reads this, has probably already started the program. it should look somehow like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author cannot maintain this handbook. it is thought to be the first version for a manual on & kaudioster, may we do it. at least, if you read this, he has to leave this section and is therefore agreed with this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, however, this does not matter since leaving & kmid; it is not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is essential for synthesizers who are not General-MIDI. in this case, the MIDI map General MIDI-MIDI events have been translated into events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, that transforms all the events of the Type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Type Change patch to Trumpet and will therefore always be heard a trumpet when playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you do not need MIDI-Map, because all sound cards are GM -compatible (including AWE and GUS cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary sizes for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as requested. prerequisite for it is, however, that every occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "A further Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options...</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so I can support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices which are not General-MIDI files.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, how the patches of General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard. general usage sees as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Note that the left side of the equal mark is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you cannot change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is used to put all sounds that are needed to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-patch 127), which sounds similar to a tissue. this includes the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (Rile supplement), it takes a patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and play the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum-patch the patch is meant, with that every sound represents a different percussionist instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc.) and not the one with which the sound is the same drum (as some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to display like sounds on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As the PATCHMAP section is the order of lines very important, as its presence. you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are mainly used to map tones on the percussions channel. take a look at the provided Keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section may be used to map some channels to others. if you want to swap the first and the second channel, simply make it to the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you are using the Keymap option, the Keymap option has to be defined further in the file! if you are using the ForcePatch option, all the events will be ignored the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for instance to always use the percussions Patch on the Perkushima channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio, in which ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied with the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forward. the value 4096 is used to do so in the map file no decimal commas).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM provides that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch in pitch with the value 4096. unfortunately, some keyboards should be playing higher up to one octave. to get the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI map, simply open the dialog box MIDI settings. please refer to the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canal view is a window with a number of Klaviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on this keyboard you can see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel you have a select list where you have changed one instrument, the button does not give green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to view the played tones. view the menu settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed, which a song is played, the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about it as a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file may lead to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the single instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support was compiled. to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example, by kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I'd like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no pleasure to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Hereby, this supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror; select all the files, and drag them onto & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, enable the Automatic Add to Collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow button on the left from the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I clicked on a & kde; Desktop with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop, if I want to play an MIDI file (if I want to play an karaoke file) or I want to play a file, only in the & konqueror; -window changing and the desired file into the window of & kmid; pull.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them directly to a collection, turn the automatic settings to the collection, and the new file will be added to the temporary collection. open files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first, you just want to play the first file. so you will make the settings automatic Add to the collection and open .mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join to also play B.C and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, I animate me, continue to program & kmid;</seg>

<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two selections are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and stacking settings. 2. the document can be written by reason.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets for the command\\ 's class contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font set. if the font is not set at the beginning, it can also be done in the text.</seg>

<seg id="1782">There are many opportunities to maintain the readability and usability of the document. for example, you can add certain fonts, fat pressure, curriculum, substrations, etc. these commands can be sent either by command\\ or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ advised {hh}: this command is available for the curative pressure and is as long as possible until he is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a sentence can be displayed in a subfolder with\\ senh {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: creates a quote in the document. the quotation starts with\\ advised {Quote} and ends with\\ end {Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source code with the & latex; markup language is now displayed, follows a step-step instructions for the creation of a document in & cile;.</seg>

<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define the specific attributes of tags and the Layout and content of the properties dialog. the file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; self. toolbars allow rapid insertion of tags in a document without a risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are nothing but folder. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the describing language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML on and dedeclare whether they are necessary, or not. although it is not necessary, it is advisable to use as many users as possible, so that other users have a better view and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and borders will be explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only contain once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags but it doesn't contain anything but only element type yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; An argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the seminar category. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Set a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is an element-element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tags. this item can only be specified once for each attribute. additionally, it contains other tags that will describe how this attribute is to be indicated & etc; This is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for the attributes in the tag editing dialog and attribute tree to the attributes.</seg>

<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodology is within & quantilus; it is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and methodology name. the arguments given to the method. may be blank or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag allows grouping elements of a list together. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the location of the attribute of a tags in a dialog. this day can occur only once in a dialog only once (e.g. once for each and lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Gives the position and size of a field in the dialog. this day should be present for each field in a dialog box (e.g. one for each box; attr &gt; & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the defining tags. this element is a just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Gives a list of elements that end a day. this element is a just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with an & XML format: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing but look out & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not result in, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools Dialog is Job & Quotaplus; select Window to start and check out TagXML. a further dialogue will appear, whose simple instructions is to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, check only when charging the TagXML files in & Quotaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example, an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP file is described. the filename of this TagXML file is to be the load.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc file; file is as quite simple and there is an editor that can be attainable via DTD-based DTD; this can be processed using a list of DTD; a simple & DTEP; it should be done with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Confusion 1 for & Quaglus; version & lt; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD. (/ / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as Nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings... created. click New action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned to a shortcut. with clicking the button 1 button a shortcut can be assigned, with the one is removed the current shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the detailed settings and inserted in the execution of the action, this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see Example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful part of the action. with the help of this action we can change external applications (usually scripts but it is not limited) that the document may change or use as input (or parts of the document), such are the quickstart -dialog, or the different view into... Actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First you have to see the name of the script and interpreter. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptase variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptase / Quanta / scripts / Quanta / scripts / Quanta / scripts / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There is another variable variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will replace the URL of the current document. within the case of a local documentary file, file is removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced by the PID of the current & quantitative lus; process is replaced. if by & Quantilus; only one instance is running, the text will be used to control the PID number; this is useful when DCOP is used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the filename of current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script intersect of & Quotlus; to accept the default input. in the selector input can be specified, what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">In accordance with the input, the output of the printed application can also be changed. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output. it can be specified, by default the default output is set by default:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create tags in logical groups. in given case it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. choose Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press release mode at the bottom of the window to edit the edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching toolbar day.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day attributes has and you are planning, activate the "Day" dialog, if available, to ensure input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igouitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? we will replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & kmenu;, Graphic Other Programs (or where else is located in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixel by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select processing others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol no only helps you to memorize what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">Regarding the beginning of the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user will be displayed; it is starting to insert a message; -tag in the current document is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this is done over the menu with Settings... (in & quaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm it with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so it still gives, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complete some usual & Quotaplus; features for toolbar, or it should set them for better overview through some separators in multiple groups. open the tool bar settings on Settings tool bar. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after the selection of the element, which is to be added to the tool bar, press the arrow button right. this adds the toolbar element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to preview for example a quick way to access the Conqueror. I will select it and add to toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note that as the separator does not support grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar might believe that the & Konqueror; button is the opposite of the Start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by typing all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Backup in the right folder. after New eXML does not exist, it will be stored in the correct folder, but your tool bar should be loaded in the correct folder. please adjust their toolbar (s) when a file is opened from the corresponding folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most mentioned extension of & Quotlus; for the normal user is the possibility of adding documentation to the script language or the formatting language you like to like. that's why this chapter explains how I create a & PHP script tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could verify your own documentation; -Repository if anyone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file. we'll need to leave the first part of it, and we will cover the second part here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index top element = Your description for these documentaries e.g. & PHP, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, day 1 = lunatic 1 = tag2.html Convention 2 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible aspect of the documentation in the document tree. for example, see in the & PHP documentation; documentation such as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Introduction = comtion.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for chess stages (except by reason) mdash; but try it out yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You note that the table of contents is referenced to a file (and is consistent at the top of the tree view & mdash; folders will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Blanks influence no, but watch out & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; web-based & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section is the area of the docrc file used for designing the context-sensitive help. for instance, when writing a & PHP script, the documentation is displayed directly for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connecting lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of dotted separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc and save it to $HOME / .kde / Quanta / doc / doc / Quanta / doc or $KDELER / share / rip / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / rip / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / rip / Quanta / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / Quanta / doc / .copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this well and it value are to be shared, send your docrc files by using the & quantum lus; -repository for the use by the & quantum lus; Community. they will not be rich, but are proud to be involved in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">& Quotaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separator resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise to whom. in different places there is an email sending menu, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & Quotaplus; -users can download. the contributions are checked and only useful for publishing the resources for which there is a GPG / PGP key for which it is warranted, both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you may have multiple keys. in the dialog with New Resource, you can fill in a dialog box (URL preview can be empty) and with clicking on OK you need to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The Upload is uploading from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbars, and folders from templates and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource before installing the resource before the installation, it examines & quantification. in case of problems, it warns and then it can be canceled. please note the warning alerts carefully. if the integrity and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the author of the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not currently created by & Quantilus; it can be time consuming, however, because hundreds of tag files may be necessary in tagXML format. there is the simpler way to automatically convert DTD to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the Menu DTD Download and Convert an DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that is to be used. after that the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string defined in! doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / or http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / webtype</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after the conversion: if activated, brings & Quotaplus; based on the conversion the descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quaplus; there are several key concepts. in order to understand this and benefit from these fundamental concepts, one must first introduce them to these fundamental concepts without their understanding & quantum agus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantum agus; the workspace is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantilus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & Quantistatic; uses, available. of toolbars over actions, everything is marked as global, in the common order structure of & Quotlus; this allows the group of administrators to secure actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development funds for a single user. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that this user can use only this user.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a certain project. this can be all done by & CSS; -patterns can be applied to the files of a certain project. simply said this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which means the use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantitative; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the construction views, the boilers, and the tool bar. please beat in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as close to the current, other or all the cards, recharging, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click on the Editorrange lead to another context menu on the processed document content, such as basic edging steps (copy / copy / paste), working under the mouse pointer or opening the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the Editorwindow, the toolbars of the editors are currently shown; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars will be shown. in the course of further expansion of & Quotlus; the tool bar will be adapted to the new functions and thus adapted user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if it is a simple day, for example & lt; you can enter the tag that the day is represented, then you can fill out the data for this just inserted day. should you fill out a day that has several attributes (as anchor), you can fill in a dialog with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction views (QIT;) allows you to open and navigate in the information about & Quotlus; to navigate it, open them. in the display with competition, documentation, scripts, attributes and documentation is available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool which provides & Quotaplus; provided. this view shows all files in the project and allows the steward of files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing uploading, or deletion of files from storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & Quantilus; is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: images, program parts, entire website & etc. There are all possibilities available to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending upon which context it is used. the category is always available, local templates are available only for the relevant users and templates in projects only in the project. more on templates can be found in the project.</seg>

<seg id="2185">In & Automaplus; many upload profiles can be uploaded to different servers with the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the Name of the server to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this doesn't have to be changed, except the network administrator runs a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a hazard. the password will be saved on the plate, so it can not be read easily but everyone can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">One Project View is only one set of files and tool bar. it can be loaded in one project, i.e. by simple deaf of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened, opened, or deleted from the toolbar, or the project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantiques; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows modification of & quantum agus; to own working methods.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, tool bar in & quantilus; best of toolbars in the best of the menu. use and addition vary. the addition of toolbars is handled in the section Add of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which the tool can be changed, toolbars or toolbars can be set, which can be specified in the dialog box where actions are to be visible on those or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, entries will be added to the entries and actions that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up and set up actions in the menu with Settings tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are common document skeletons, code carvings and files for linking. & Quantilus; they can copy, move or move into the system existing directory in the store space. templates have in & quantum dus; in about the limitations you imagine to the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & Quotlus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything not pure text. it can be any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary lists are usually inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are listed in the preamplifier tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be written by any text document. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, specifying documents can be found in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the subfolder under global templates. see also for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful, if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template, but the same text area will always be inserted in the documents. you can find all the examples below a complete menu system on javascript or Perl. see for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are for whole web sites like templates. they are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure according to customers (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose file as template stores as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, notice that (even if it was stored as a project template) the Template is not visible in the repository. look under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As you save the selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Creating binary templates is simple: to copy the file only to a template folder. you can use all file management functions to be used, such as pulling and inserting or inserting over the file tree of konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click in the file tree or in the repository block manview to a folder right click and secure site template to secure a name for the template and secure it. by default, it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very effective approach. you can insert header and footer or dynamically linked with & PHP; add files or link them to them. in addition, some things can be found very deep in the eye when using templates.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the submenu templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates / Quanta / template / templates.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of an folder can be selected in the template list with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu features. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded, as soon as terrestrial attributes is verb.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except for the master folders in the template. if a master folder would be set in this way, the Blah would appear with something like plain text. if nothing appears, you will probably be found in a stem folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows the preceding or displayed text for templates in this folder. this might be common header and footer for all templates for a particular project, allowing a whole presentation to equip an entire header with the matching headline / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally you have a context menu (pointing to the right button menu) using a full command collection for adding folders or copy and paste from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& Quantilus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source code editor that can be accessed via the menu View. the first mode is replacing the source code editor in two parts: the source code editor and VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor is as follows: he invites you to edit a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and install the source code as required in the VPL; editor visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Working with the VPL; editor in a document, the & PHP; contains, a small green symbol indicates the Vohandary of & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; code editor. there is no plans to modify this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor is active in the source code editor and in the VPL, this mode is already active, triggering the active cursor itself from one window to another, where the position is kept in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source code editor can be adjusted between synchronization after a click or automatic. in the option you can automatically select the time span. in principle, the duration of the time can be adjusted. a small range for fast machines and a large range for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the editing of invisible tags is possible, as soon as a new document is made with the VPL; editor is also called as soon as a new document with the VPL. this allows you to change the manual of the manual. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added by pushing the two buttons below or removed. one click into the list allows alteration of the content, e.g. keywords on the name and keyword key wort2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS-rules are the new way of creating pages in browsers. you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete. a change on the list is exactly as possible with the meta elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported yet.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style template by pressing the file button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is as written in a word processing, by moving with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor is acting as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typing or remove back caste.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is not done in the same way as the source code editor, such as in the source code editor, such as an anchor tag, which is inserted in the same way if a drop tag, surrounded with text, must be removed each other ambient air tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bar like the tables assistant or lists assistant are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists of toolbars must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2283">The program used by myself only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what was changed in these lines. and there was no indications in the places where perhaps only the recirradiation had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences in line and modifications to white characters. later, a lot of further useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you would like to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and add it in one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">Function that made a lot of work was the comparative and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge will be fully supported if two people work independently in one piece of code and make changes to the same time. the original file (the basis) helps you to process the result. in this editor you can even edit the result. the screenshot shows three jell files during assembly:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you with the merge and merge complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in folder memory:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and enlightest the possibilities of changing color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visibly. if lines distinguish only in a certain number of white characters, this can be seen at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no anger if any one changes the returns.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file varies. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can ease your typing work by typing only the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 3 folder 1 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows manual tipping of filenames, the selection over the file browser (file...) or the selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. you will not have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences will be conducted with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Through the button folders... you can also select a folder, if you select a folder, if you select a file, for B and C, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other files.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merge is crossed, the input field is active for the target and can be retrieved. however, it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup knob opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start with the same / merge tab.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard. in open dialogue you do not have to select files. you can simply connect the dialog with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and place drag: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes, a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you need to figure out how similar to these functions, they would just need to copy, paste in & kdiff3; now you can easily copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: now you can not extract anything from & kdiff3; only the flaw of text is supported in a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insert text into another program as slicing and insertion (instead of copying and insertion). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each textwindow, the Info line contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window. (when the path to a file is too long, let the mouse see a while over the line. then a little help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences we can change over the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, the default color is visible, the default color is different. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is very useful when you compare three files. that's in the next paragraph (merge) good.</seg>
<seg id="2306">In addition to the text, the column is displayed. if differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. with some programming languages, where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (C / C + + Z. B. are only the relevant changes relevant for the processor and in a few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the text column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line file is activated, the line will be scored on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison windows) also has an Info line with the inscription issue:, the filename and [Add Symbol] if you have edited the result. usually it contains the automatic merge already contains lyrics, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons jumping at the next / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparing windows are used, every difference is a conflict which must be solved manually at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown. (this will also be visible a jump in the position in the windows.) This group becomes highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left there is a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes the automatic merge function or by manual editing is left no more in the group; then it is shown in these lines of text & lt; no line appears in the box; this text is neither shown in the final saved file, nor in a marking you might copy and somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; Conduct flows; however, in the clipboard, if you copy this text from the result window. carefully go with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources ignore or ignorant C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates will mainly navigate with the image movements and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are using in one of the windows, you can also use the keyboard section, side, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end. the Fsican column next to the vertical image bar can also be used to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Insert button, you can switch between insertion and transfer mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the assembling columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already explained in the section and explained the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / last difference (Ctrl-Fig. / Ctrl-click), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-click) to the next / previous conflict. therefore, all conflicting conflicts will continue to be considered conflict. therefore, between solutes and unsolved conflicts has to be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking in the clipboard, you must copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this option is activated, you will automatically copy the clipboard. be careful with this option, however, as you could not overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line number are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors are using a line slot for\, and Win32-based systems do not use cline slot for\\ r\. KDiff3 reserves the line files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; you can't use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files will be saved when moving and restored in the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a lettering with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also represents the fonts with variable width to choose from, but they should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you tick this option, differences in italics are displayed. if the selected script does not support this presentation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Systems with only 16 or 256 colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered powerfully. by these systems, the button presets an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tabulator key. otherwise, a tabulator will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press entering or return Return, the entry of the previous line will be automatically used for the next row.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will be copied to the clipboard. then manually copy the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection of the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">For the comparisons of files & kdiff3; first, all the identical lines in the source files can be found. only during this first step, white characters may be ignored. in this step, white characters are ignored. also in merge, white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a file-backlash '\' on the end of a line, but then files are displayed with different sizes in the side-to-side comparison only, though they are different with different sizes, but then they might be different. during assembly, this option must be disabled. this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis numbers and related signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled by default. changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively search for smaller differences. the option is activated by default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly over very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">This setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed, before the next unsolved conflict is skipped.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Triggers all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if you are only using the functions of vle A / B / C for all unsolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the auto selection also ignore or ignore for C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter to scanning, folders, and run a merge operation. look for details under documentation in the directory comparison and merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and an older version exists, then the original version is Suffix .original attached. if already such a backup file with the suffix .original, it will be deleted without further fuse.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of user interface. change this option does not affect the current running program. you have to finish & restart the current running program. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because language is set to control over the control center there.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activates this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Using the selector for co-coding a short note, which is the local coding. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files can be compared and merged with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">When you have edited a file, you can define what encoding to store is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define anticipation commands, they might not work with your Codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only deal with 8 bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to refrain from changes in white characters in text or review (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignoring or Ignoring C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files are displayed. according to the selection of A & lt; B, A & lt; -gt; C, A & lt; -gt; C, C & B & lt; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C; C & lt; C; C; C; C; C & lt; C; C; C; C; C & lt; C;</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines. simply open the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparison window next side or overlap. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together. a simple click will lead to the merge file as default for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the file name again, then the name of the last used file is kept.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use this function for example, for removing disturbing parts or to correct the recording.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is assigned to this external command (see above), then the output of this command file is used. the output of this command is only used for line function, which corresponds to exactly your requirements. each input line does have to have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when set-up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it. however, the good news is that in most cases used as used or perl.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this procedure command for line input to convert the input header for input characters: SED's /\\ U\\ 1 /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\\.\\ 1 into the replacement string. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert strings (info: / cvs / keyword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with used, you might begin to understand it and might even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line-off. sed sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Every match between '[' and ']' is a hit, thus somehow deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform multiple constraints once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the arrays each other. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of used, you can also use something else, e.g. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch "However, in perl a few details differently. where used\\ (and\\) needs only (and) without the preceding '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal processing processor are maintained for display and merge. further operations are only modified the data that the line-line Algorythmus can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-up-processor sees the output of the normal preprocessors as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but as with any function, text changes or differences, you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object; you can customize the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... the merge can simulate and simulate the simulated changes, without performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... select selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merge of individual files. you only need to open the folder on the command line or in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as the base. if no target folder has been given, it uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will not start automatically, not to merge the merge you need to select the appropriate menu entry, or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will inform a small message window about current progress. if you cancel the folder scanning, only the files will be listed that are compared to the time.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning process is complete, displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Every file and any folder found during the scan, is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object, or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions and open all subdirectories with which you can fold or flfold all the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double click on a file, the file is launched and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail pane to the selected object. in such a case the merge action can not be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about the problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As you can see in the picture above, the colors A / B / C are used in red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">However, the color is identical with identical entries, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical if their total content is the same. then, folders also have the same color. for folders the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colors of a sheet which is only green then yellow and later when it is old, turned red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copying to A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A a folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faults exist, the merge cannot be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same type of file (e.g. if A a folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faults exist, the merge cannot be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The syncing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified, and if the option directories are synchronised. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not identical are: merged and the result can be stored in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; directly after convermerge & kdiff3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and then select the new file instead of merge (uncertain), then examined and discard the newer file. if the files are different, but the same date appears as if such bugs might not be removed, the merge folder cannot be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During assembly, a file is processed after the other hand. you state Status column is ready, and according to other messages, when the merge is completed, you should make a last review and see whether the status is working everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If set-in dialog the file comparison method is selected, KDiff3 will display further columns. these include the number of unsolved, dissolved, non-white and white clasps. (the column for dissolved conflicts will only be shown if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can merge either the just selected entry (file or Odner) or all entries at once. if you have selected all interceptions (even in all subfolders), you can launch the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified your target folder, then in the Three-folder merge mode C will be used as a goal, and when synchronizing B and / or B will be used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries can be displayed in the target folder, even in the folder structure you may change. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To uncover all entries, select the directory / continue in the directory Menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to perform only the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can select a valid promotion for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window with the options run, stimulate and break off.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simpla if you would like to see what would happen, without the really changes made. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (sharing a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready with a file, select / continue the directory and press F7. if you have not saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3 will continue working with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list see some error messages which are to help you choose the cause of the problem. so you have the chance to select a different action for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before you proceed to merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, these entries (in the current session) and execute them not checked upon later. even if the merge function has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be changed once more.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only the files that correspond to the specified pattern will be entered in the elementary tree. separate pattern with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default folder is not listed in this pattern.</seg>

<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. a great advantage is that this folder is specific to a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a plug-in attribute. in other file systems, a leading scan. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When switching to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. when the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links display. this is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In links to the folder: if the option is turned off, the links are turned on. if the option is turned on, the links are treated like normal files. a link to a folder shows a link on yourself and & kdiff3;) This option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Execute a full analysis of each file by showing the statistics column. (the number of solved, unsolved, non-white and white clasps.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when they are applied on files that do not contain text. (give an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders on a slow network, it may be quicker to compare the change date and the file size. please proceed with caution. this option is activated by default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to a change date. no real comparison instead. the files are considered identical. this may be useful if copying the change date. please proceed with caution. this option is activated by default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activate the synchronising mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified. in this mode, the results will be identical. also, the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merge the copying of the newer file is proposed as an action. (this is considered uncertain that the other file is not changed as well.) This option is checked in any case.) This option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced or deleted, the original version is renamed. if an old backup file is already installed with the .original extension, this will also affect individual files, not only the merge file. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge tab stops visible to the merge of individual files; you can turn the window panel with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the window directory & text window in the window menu and switch the change between the directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You will probably choose a file simply by double click. nevertheless, there is a corresponding item menu also. you can also use a single file directly, without copying the folder and the file will not run once again when you launch the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory again: directory - menu: new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders located on local or remote computers.</seg>

<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively flat. or.. it is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, empty line &gt;% 20, etc.) for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol. there is a brief list of the limitations:</seg>

<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit authorizations or change date. therefore, vary the permissions or change date from the original. (please consider the size confidential.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of the purpose is currently the differences of the differences in KDevelop. KDevelop first starts the built-in differences. in order to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>

<seg id="2427">In Conqueror you can click on a patch file and select "KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. additionally, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since creating the patch file.</seg>

<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will be treated as identical but if just a non-white character will be different, the line is not identical to each other, which will be the next to each other, which will be the case in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor remembers every difference in the files where it begins and where it ends. that's necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the result simply as a text file and it is too much effort to design that this information might save.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was so far too large. you can use a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to process larger amounts of text should be used by another editor.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, once the mouse pours a while on the same place. it is meant for helping people to emulate the Repent Strain Injury (RSI) Syndrome and to emulate the mouse click with the mouse. however, it may require a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool, can handle the pain that comes with the mouse click and helps to use so many people who are using the computer without pain. unfortunately, you can locate your computer when using your computer, if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clear it again: even if & kmousetool; pain helps prevent pressed with the mouse, it is used against pain, which is caused by moving the mouse, useless. and as with all the ergonomic aids, the result may expire for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; supervises your mouse movements and execute a mouse click once you break down the motion.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent move is activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after it is run by pushing the mouse button. in this way, you can do the drag by pressing a mouse button. the smart moving requires a little exercise but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">The time of the mouse has to be stopped at the end of the mouse button, before & kmousetool. a mouse click out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">When Intelligentes switched on, the turning point is active (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the mouse button is waiting, before it can release the mouse button again, if no moving is done because of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; supported by clicking on the mouse. if this function is activated, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are launched in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can move & kde; to shorten the reaction time. go to the Sound System and click on the tab. there is a shegrowing sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is set; for every launch of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; please consult the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings on the values that were set when opening the dialog. have already pressed the button for users, the settings are reset to the user after clicking the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first using the preferences. in particular, the intelligent move should be switched off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later take the intelligent move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response time of & kde; at sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make yourself aware of which places a mouse click without effect: that click on the neutral entities of windows or on places in the browser window that does not leave any link. therefore, you can park your mouse in such places until you would like to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. that's usually pretty simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse button, but also the roles, which come into contact with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, the mouse is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be quick to view the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole, into which the ball was used. the dirt and the dirt can be easily scrapped with a flat blade or the finger nails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; when you use the intelligent move in this case, this means that & kmousetool does not mean that the operation can no longer be replaced by the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; move under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you do run a mouse click. by this, the status of & kmousetool will be reset. back and you can continue like usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you input text, try & kmousetool. continue to run mouse clicks and make the cursor itself in a different place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor place where you want to make it. but by pushing the mouse click into a neutral field of desktop, if you don't want to create a keypresses. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart moving, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very possible to copy and paste in the clipboard, with which you will probably cause problems with pressed mouse button. however, here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent move if you just start using & kmousetool; to use. select text instead as follows: run the Shift key down to the other end of the text and press the mouse button once again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this makes every time playing when & kmousetool; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click. so you can use the intelligent move even without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">In order to be able to use & kmousetool; you must have the XTest extension for & X window; this should be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and a loudspeaker that has been set up properly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button shortly after the mouse pours. this program has been developed for people who are endowed on the RSI syndrome and those who stew pain in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that a certain time is waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button is loosed. in this way, the pulling and off with the mouse can also be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filter is not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text will be processed before he will be sent to the program speech dispatcher. they are useful for improving pronunciation words or abbreviations to select a matching language and spokesman or to circumvent certain shortcomings of voice synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the work of filtering, it is important to know how the program "speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four kinds of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screenshots has the highest priority. it will be withdrawn to all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the Screen Reader is read, the kept orders will be continued again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning has priority and holds the output of news and regular text. these orders will continue after the release of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next one priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of a application that can read messages. while you & eg; a long text on a web page, you can read & kmouth. & k.; notifications are also news. read this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text contracts. each order, which you toff from the card card, is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications used by text contracts. text contracts are designed for the output longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except the edition of Screen Readers. if a application sends the issue of a Screen Readers, while & ktts; just such a read, this output will stop and stop.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters can never be applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, news and text contracts, and & kde; messages are applied.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter editing the text and pass it on to the next filter. at present there are three kinds of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are implemented as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String dropouts replace parts of a text by other text. the replacement parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; it is possible by using Chat-Emotions like: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & KMail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. in the delivery of & boards; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With Speaking Search filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or on the program that send the text to & ktts; if you have submitted an example on the map memory card a female voice, you can read listings by KDE messages. read more about this.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which he does not apply to voice output. if the filter shows that its rules are not able to apply the text on the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text contract is sent to a message, warning or a & kde; Notification on & ktts; it will be processed by all activated filters that are rendered on the page below. the processing by the filter is carried out in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the submitted normal filter. if a filter is not enabled, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to add a new filter. select the type of the filter, and the further below setup dialogs will be shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up character set filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. then, the text will be exchanged in the text, then the text will not be considered against the related spare text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filters. you can choose this name as you wish, only from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in column match and replace it in accordance with the string from the column Set. the list will be processed from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can store a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save the current list or delete the list from a file, the entries are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If the text is registered here, the filter will only be used if the spokesman speaks for the text contract one of the languages registered here. you can also select multiple languages if you click the & Ctrl; button pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is registered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can input several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, KMail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The user ID-running programs can be obtained with the program qdbus; the & Dbus; -numbers you have to omit. if for example & qdbus; the user ID Copter ID 3432 is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The character set filter is only applied to the text, if all the conditions with one entry in the box Apply filter. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all text.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the duplicencing filter uses regular expressions in the form of\\ S word\\. the words must therefore be limited by separators (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no manual for writing regular expressions. if you have the & kde; -Editor & # 160; Versions & # 160; Versions & # 160; for & # 160; Versions & # 160; expressions can be found in the box.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The "speech dispatcher" program uses a adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you wish to expand & ktts, you get in touch with the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter is however not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & t, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer) including the packages kdelibs and the software files for the "speech dispatcher" program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you purchase the source texts from & boards; you can purchase and install the source archive for kdeaccessibility, or download the program created every night, and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts; check first if speech dispatcher works correctly with your voice synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell scripts spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4, the first version of & tile is used, that the program speech dispatcher uses. the program kttmsgr is designed to be so advanced that the installation of speech dispatcher is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>

<seg id="2705">Warnings have priority considered. this stage is important news like & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning will keep the output of news and regular text. these orders will continue after the warning of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of a application that can read messages. if you & eg; just a long text on a web page you can agree with & kmouth; nevertheless someone pleased that enters the room.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard, in order to mark text for voice output, the speech speed, the noise, the sex, and the pitch. for example, SSML is a part of the voiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently, SSML supports only partially and only in the basic functions. the following limitations are present:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ dimonitor voice (British male) since this is the standard voice, the festival is used at the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival-configuration dialog is not set to 100nbsp;%, the SSML text is usually very monoton.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two kinds of filters - normal filters and typing limiting filters (SDB-filters). SBDs must start to read and start with the first set of synthesize, not the whole word order. thus, you can jump or stop, even if the language synthesizer is not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the typing-evident filters. in the first start of & ktts; the preference is automatically set up. you can change the settings or add another typography filter, beginners will not use it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to test up the device selection by phone. switch on the box selection as well. switch off the box selection again, change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker changed. to do this, you have to have more than one speaker changed, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then quicker with the read can begin, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole word block what can take very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You will then be able to execute or cancel text orders on the map tab, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal user-limiting filter is automatically set up when you start tsmsmgr for the first time. it cannot be disabled but do not change anything at this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Automatically compare text with a regular expression for propositions and add a tab character (decimal code 8) to the propositional sign (decimal notation is automatically removed from the text). note that the default set limiting filter is retained.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (comp), warnings, news or output of screen reads.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have already removed the normal and limitless filter-filter, you can insert it again by loading the specified _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can write the map settings on the map tab. the map will be displayed if</seg>

<seg id="2740">Choose the properties of the wished speaker here. if this property doesn't matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Check this check box where the property should have precedence over other features. you can also place multiple markings.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. the only case you might want to specify the attribute language lies before, when you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than that of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the area speaker, which matches the following below, click on the Selection tab, and then apply for narrator, which matches the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the final text order in the queue. you can also specify a serial number. (no order number is required to enter 0).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes when it started. I have compiled debug support, but I don't get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is tumbler and tonne. probably you must register GStreamer. when the problem is not solved, possibly a non compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application, freezes & ktts; a message appears on the & console; a message appears, which says: to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, there is the problem that conflicts with ALSA have to prevent a simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. the information on possible solutions will be found on the web page of the ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-ampt.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet. I have installed them and can't use it in festival but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice to you in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / celebrities. as a manual, please send a patch together with the & URL, on which you have found the voice to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the box card there is a setting speed. so this works, the program has to be installed in SOX and will use the environment variable PATH. some synthesizmodulators like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, this function is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the language are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read it. (note that the HTML is controlled by SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; (see) or if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of & HTML; -after-SSML file formwork filter, and set up the microphone speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it read that websites are read with a female voice. I have created a female festival speaker, but & tts; read the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the tag SABLE GENDER do not seem to work. so Festival produced no mistakes, the XSL file for converting SSML into SABER the GENDER tags. the same applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a own character set filter and now I can go back in & t; no longer spare or return. on the box record orders will be shown, the job will stand out only from a proposition. what am I doing wrong?</seg>

<seg id="2797">The best use a command to send the voice output into a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to audio equipment</seg>
<seg id="2798">This handbook explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, one module for the & kcontrolcenter; that enables the administration of network interfaces, of routine and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows users to manage a set of system and desktop settings through a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple surface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network setting is installed in the & kcontrolCentre; you can configure network settings (knetworkconf;). it can be launched by selecting from kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical equipment and their drivers must already be installed and configured, so & knetworkconf; this device can be seen at all and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices will be installed while installing and set up. will network appliances be added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Settings module is loaded when the network settings are selected in the & kcontrolcenter; index is selected. when starting module settings this system is trying to automatically detect the platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform is not detected, the manual selection is offered. it is best used to select the distribution and release date. by marking the setting up-again the setting can be hit permanently. in the next start of the network settings this selection will be preset automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in system administrators, meaning that the settings can only be considered, the change can only be considered. in the system administration mode you can reach the right bottom end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password mode.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces serves for managing the network devices of the system. all available network appliances are displayed. the following tasks can be carried out from the tab network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Set the settings shown for network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button... in the dialog device can be set up.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. please click on the button with continued possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">In automatic mode the TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP address for any system start is needed. in the selective list, no further settings are required. in the list box can be selected either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the choice manual, the TCP / IP address can be performed using DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address the required TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system will initialize the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as the features of the device in the box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not used yet. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you can determine if the requested address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices may be enabled or switched on if required. switch off one-off network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network appliances can be activated or switched off depending on your needs. deactivated a activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">The IP address of the host in the local subnet specifies the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communications with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than one network interface, the interface on the network must be selected, where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces the full IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer is only possible to use IP addresses, DNS calls this name to an IP address like 123,45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for the name resolution is a simple copy of this list. entries can be added, removed or amended .DNS entries can be added by selecting an insert and up or downgrading in the list with the buttons below or down in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">When pressing the button Add... from the group computer to name resolution a DNS server can be added. it will add the new name server to the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the machine computer to name resolution you choose an entry and then click on the button Edit.... It will show the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of well-known computers represents the name-to-IP address intermittance to the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for booting, if no DNS server is available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list contains well-known computers a few entries, which support & apos; localhostakos; and some special IPv6 addresses are supported, and the current version of IP is still to be replaced in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well known computer and then click Add.... The New Deal appears Add as alias.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well known computer and click the Add-name button. if the known machine has several alias name, add the button Add several times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a well-known computer from the list and select Edit.... The dialog box is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then by clicking it OK the list of static hosts is updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings specified in the module settings are not effective immediately in the system. to activate the changes, the following command must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage from & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installing the binary distributions (mostly rpm) packages), if & kde is installed; and Qt is installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface like kpackage or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, Qt and & kde are just sufficient, but also the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended to experienced users. however, it is not difficult, & knetworkconf; to compile. the following commands should accomplish this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf; altered configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area may not replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix contains only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are currently run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been found great dissemination. IPv6 will continue to handle it in the near future. this description is currently focused on the spread of IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address of a network interface is enabled. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the response agency that is available in DHCP. in any case, the IP address may not simply be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specially designated for this purpose, to avoid IP addressing conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks are usually used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is big enough for networks up to 250 hosts.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat, is a program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape. the first goal was to create a surface for tar, which showed the ability of dds2tar to fast, selective unpacking. the second purpose was the answer of a tar which my wife lasted, how much longer it takes?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it has to be modified by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; join the tape and reads the prestressing information of the band. detects & kdat; the leader on the tape does not, you will ask if the tape is supposed to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat, searching for the matching index on your plate. if it cannot be found, you will be asked whether the index index should be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, the symbol of the tape drive, in order to indicate that the tape has been shown. according to the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the band can now be searched by flaps of the belt.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before eject the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to achieve this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; is recognizable by changing the symbol for the tape, that the binding for the tape has been solved, and shows a corresponding message in the statusbar. the tape can now be thrown out without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat, used, it must be formatted and formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band types must be formatted before you need to store data. this process does not match the formatting at & kdat; this process does not need to formatting the tape. floppy disk drives usually have a formatting of the band, DAT drives.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity drives & kdat, with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape are lost. after completion of the formatting, the tape is automatically mounted and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup procedure, you need to select the backup files. that can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in a local file tree. it will only be stored in this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a safety profile in the tree. only the files are stored in the profile.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select the Backup menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is introduced, the dialog for backup. in this dialog you can again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Once you confirm the attitudes, the dialog to backup. the dialog shows the backup of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the entries in the entry for the drive. it will only be checked the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Check the files in one of the archives created in the entry for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog for checking. in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the workfolder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you confirm the settings for review, the dialog appears assessments. this dialog shows the progress of the test process, as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you recover the restore, the files need to be restored, the files are to be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in any of the archives that belong to the tape record. it will be restored only the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click with the right button of the mouse on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore on the menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog for restoring. in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the workfolder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you confirm the settings for restoring, the dialog appears again. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process, as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to reproduce the bandindex file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can reproduce the index in two ways from the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This provides a safety profile with the currently selected files and standard settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current subfolder, where the backup should take place. the list of stored files will be updated automatically according to the selected web folders.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, that can only be secured on the same file system, such as the folder. folders that can be installed on other file systems. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file will be created. only the files have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all the files to be secured and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons's buttons; and lt; missing; files were not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">Set the settings by setting up the menu item KDat... settings in the Settings menu. the following settings may be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path needs to refer to the non-rewinding variant of the belt.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this setting active, transmits & kdat, before the tape is mounted to the drive. at some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, the option tries to lock the tape. maybe this setting is not working with all bandits.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is on, the tape is switched off by & kdat; automatically ejected the tape. do not use this option with floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched ON, & kdat; change the hardware code size for the tape drive. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case you have to share the log size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this string is: seconds, where machine name is the full name of the system, on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has been formatted since the time in which the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives created directly with & GNU / tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup tape. this symbol is only active if a band is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer suitable for system logs. the program is suitable for unexperienced users where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about the various protocol files, for example, with fast access to information about problems which appear on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background. the program is suitable for unexpected users who cannot know where to get information about your system or where the system departs the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog provides, experienced users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; thus tries to deliver some advanced functions, which can be filtered and analyzed by the protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog has a number of useful functions. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the file of the Syslog server and samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also contained and explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions are available, using their help to filtering the single protocol-lines of a protocol and filtering the various options for sorting and filters in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol-file of the system - the system Protocol - to open. will not start with system administrator. the protocol files are usually done under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user does not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or for entered character sets. in addition, a string column is displayed next to the selected filter. in addition, a log line will be displayed next to the filter. then, a log line appears only if in a column the string search string is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this position. select the string of the filter search page, then select the column process in the corresponding column, and also bear the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol-lines which were sent or created from this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you to see the important protocol-lines. protocol-lines of the level error are displayed with a striking colour as protocol-lines of the level indicator. the color display of protocol-lines can be shut down dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain process (for example in the system protocol or in cron protocol), you can select the process identification (PID) in the process case. this may be useful for example if you want to inspect the output of a specified command, such as the start of the samba server. in this case, you will use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add To New Lines option in the main window of the main window to view all new protocol-lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystem.log; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website based on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. date you find further information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also known as known as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly develops into the standard for controlling the program start-up of the system in the Linux; world. and this is why it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further along with historical aspects (among others because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binaries is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important, because perhaps someone could try to transfer a machine on System V Init without a re-installation and re-format. that's why you must make sure that the old Init has been removed from there if there was one file there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service you want to start at the high drive system or when moving to another runlevel. system services, however, do not include such things such as setserial, which only once started. such views belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also let go a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in various places after the program init and starts the first to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is set in / etc / inittab. you should see one line in the beginning as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column, and probably realize that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can fix them if you do not change it by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder no correct files are. instead, each entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops init actually system services? quite simple: any of the scripts are written so it's an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the an K contains, the script runs with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running level, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; running, & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; you should not be very difficult because the program was built as user friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another display device is easy to not say, trivial: simply drag the entry from the range of availables to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift scripts between Runlevels or change the position within one level by moving it somewhere else. this is only happening in the entry of his original runlevel (or its position). this only happens when they draw an entry in the field of availables.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you copy them into a new field. in order to copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select from the menu or add from the context menu -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of any single entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no way to restore entries, which have been thrown into the trash bin. so caution.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator key to activate the different working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 stop, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection lower or below the previous function.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another round level, move it with cuting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; x) and add it to the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change sorting order number or name of a single entry manually, press the tab key to open the Properties dialog. close the dialog by pressing the button to accept the changes, or press Enc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Due to the risk of data loss all entries in the menu requires a confirmation before it is executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if it is available. otherwise, they will be stored by & ksysv; it will be stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have tried experimenting with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine will constantly start. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the entry button to start in individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended to run under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way that system services can be started in these distributions, simplified the configuration for proprietary establishments of these distributions, but is unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution here: check if all configuration files are present (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) just terminate without a message when their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the Linux; running level varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is enough to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the appropriate symbol of toolbar or record saving in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the user or group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you have limited system settings (Quota) for users, a card card will be made, if shadow-passwords or example / etc / master.passwd are installed as BSD port.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password authorization mode appears, if shadow passwords or example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD port.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This box card only appears when enabled and initialized (Quota) for at least one built-in filesystem (Quota). here you can change parameters for each user parameter, with the limited number of data in KB.</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the array file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The groups will be informed about the user belonging to the selected user. the standard group, which the user belongs, can be found in the Primacy Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in the field by selecting these in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog ability tab contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select Add User or Move menu or click the edit button. edit or delete the selected user or the selected group.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can add the LILO-Boats, add and change the boot time, change the time until for booting the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change, modify and change operating systems.</seg>
