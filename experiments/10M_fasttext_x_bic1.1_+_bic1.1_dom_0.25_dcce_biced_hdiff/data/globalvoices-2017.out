although I had visited the United States at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinary .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , American authors have read and run American music .
in fact , this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ tham in The Pel@@ ican cover , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura @-@ Student , who were having inc@@ lined his interest in his interest .
I was caught .
free after Method Man , &quot; I was like that the absolute truth is , forget everything that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only increased .
I always say : &quot; America is the only country in which I ever lived , its diversity is so welcoming that you can always be that you are and it is easily acceptance in a community of like minded people .
I even had a very black@@ out love report about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came over .
a lot has been written about the rulers and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , how he proceeds with his engines .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully .
he tells what he thinks like a former colleague , and explained openly about his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women .
nevertheless , people responded to his testimony and tuned them in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes , which he won with rep@@ ubli@@ can pre @-@ election , was the highest number one ever achieved by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans , who support this big@@ ots person , I asked myself ?
I was not able to harmon@@ ize tr@@ ump and v@@ oters with people whom I had met in Phoenix during my time .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the Journ@@ alism program that takes people from all over the world , a deeply belie@@ ving human being , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ ump does not agree with the fact that Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a did not agree with the present editor of the &quot; Cincinn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; watching the game .
Tr@@ ump &apos;s in@@ tolerance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I had experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gling for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
it still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , which always helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , were my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot with my career .
these people and the em@@ bo@@ died by them em@@ bo@@ died my love in America .
while Tr@@ ump conf@@ uses his way to nominal rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential data , they offered a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out to be the exception of rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly whit@@ ish , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the idea with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to design@@ ate the tr@@ ump @-@ v@@ oters as r@@ attle .
to arrange people , &quot; said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ icial and respec@@ tful , and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hec@@ tic transform@@ ations in their communities .
could it be that these v@@ oters have voted for Tr@@ ump , of which most have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in America ?
perhaps maybe .
however , hardly anyone cannot forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who rep@@ ates the cruel decision , looking up a man who looks down with regard to those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( CEO of the WC ) : &quot; as much as &quot; ob@@ struc@@ tions of the White against all other eth@@ orn &quot; ; p@@ un of white in reference to the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what is so much like Sch@@ eff@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as was the great Van Jones called what America did so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background can always have , America is welcomes everyone .
for this country chose the son of an Ken@@ y@@ man twice the story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise , and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and all the term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who was fallen in Iraq , and what he said at the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , &quot; would have been my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd breaks out .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they responded .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! they called them and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; could anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN ! &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; God be thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land rejo@@ iced for his son , sent a message to him .
that &apos;s now Tr@@ ump Land , said the message .
and all the people looking like Mr. Khan could not find any more place in this new America .
and this breaks my heart to me .

what has the mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ an city Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
the fact that the music , which is played on both places , is not only the life of children , but also a very close alliance with ...
music that lives with the tr@@ ash
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby man@@ ic ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for some years La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( M@@ ban@@ ger ) has been playing in the commune : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has a possibility to overcome her surrounding poverty .
a musical school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community that is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces Mexico is known for its drugs abuse and the Ban@@ ff violence .
but this situation changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had so rare hop@@ el@@ essly .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , meaning the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their big passion .
they always come with smiling and play with shiny eyes and play in the bust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from the garbage
more than 7.000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically on the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay , capital - on instruments made from recycled plastic material :
music with restored instruments , made up of local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recy@@ c@@ ler must have begun under the bat@@ on of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez , parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , co@@ elli , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trump@@ ets , trombone and percussion .
the repertoire encomp@@ asses classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local econom@@ ist and musician of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , re@@ members the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach us at the same place . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact their parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
that changed when F@@ avi@@ o had been shown something he had never seen before : a string produced from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments of re@@ processed material and is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary named &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic land@@ fill dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who are living with him and of him are the most dangerous - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land @-@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectac@@ le out of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played its music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that strikes the wild illegal fishing industry .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports specific solutions for environmental issues .
the release happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of contents .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already been operated in the Malt@@ ese waters of illegal fishing , before it was searching for the other coast of Africa .
according to the east African countries , the East African countries were slightly inc@@ lined to welcome a bill of bills of this kind .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ore , Mozambique and the Seychelles have spe@@ edi@@ fied up against the ship . they refused to occupy one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing photo courtesy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pill@@ age of the country .
the core of this initiative , which protects the criminal practices and protecting resources was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , in 2012 by N@@ RO stop illegal fishing ( Il@@ legal Fis@@ her@@ ies ) .
the members of this network include the six countries in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , which then had driven out the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to locate it . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the obvious dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and types are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem will harm the delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing once were hin@@ dered by bureau@@ cratic hur@@ dles , and also through the sn@@ ail speed , these actions happen in real time , with trace@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange rates of existing licenses for example , to susp@@ ect or experience any updates during a port inspec@@ tor .
fish @-@ i persec@@ uted the activities of ships even very attentive , when moving from the open sea through satellite data .
this enables the authorities to identify ships which fish in forbidden regions . also , it can be ev@@ apor@@ ated road routes - such as such that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
in the Ide@@ al@@ case , such investigations may show if the participating ships have a fisher@@ ies policy , where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing may , on the basis of these information , may be denied the acceptance of such ships in their har@@ bours . what means that the ships cannot be sold their cargo . and that they can even be forced to numbers from pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says , &quot; P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , a management director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost revenues , which account for eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to the illegal fishermen , forming in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive fish fisher@@ ies , as it attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also illegal fishing fishermen .
among their practices , such as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit lic@@ en@@ ware , statement by iden@@ tik@@ it name , fishes protected species and fish in nature @-@ areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this legal ab@@ lo@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its founding , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 exam@@ inations of suspected ships .
it has exposed criminal networks , which had f@@ ake lic@@ ences used in Tanzania . it discovered ships which used several dec@@ eit@@ ful ident@@ ities and it has tra@@ pped vol@@ at@@ ile ships .
because of its collaboration with Inter@@ pol , the international authority for the fight of crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i may share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far to the organized crime &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to produce more precise ships more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be developed further , helps to hide the illegal ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Shi@@ can Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch for example their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different information levels together . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ag@@ gregate ships with greater precision .
one model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence the global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth was opened together with Google and the Maritime conservation organization Oce@@ ana the platform Global Fishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed all over the world by means of each track@@ able ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do that in a global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts &quot; have a similar project in which a global system allows the pursu@@ it of ships .
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only det@@ ective but also sc@@ are off .
ships which used to be conf@@ is@@ cated without license and have barely given consequences of consequences , now they know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile a 33 % increase in fishing @-@ revenues , since fishing boats have more licenses .
in fact , when F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia has helped , Gre@@ ko 1 found inspec@@ tors there on board tow @-@ nets which is prohibited .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of heavy demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government &apos;s proposal rejected the opposition of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted to the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country to the void , as they were assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( approximately : the back@@ order of Venezuela ) can be found in both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among others in the North @-@ land Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the centrally located Bun@@ dest@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is continually deteri@@ or@@ ated , which is reflected in the everyday life of vene@@ ers by a acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the guard of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . ultimately , the maintenance of a new choice was held by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of government statement as follows :
in the context of social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate of inflation was estimated at 500 % ( the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and close a new government alliance .

the call was commented on Twitter among other things , as follows :

the first demonstration within the framework of the Programme &quot; The provisions of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the mar@@ ries , which are published in real @-@ time , test@@ ify among others an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as adv@@ o@@ cates of the government .

the news spread very large waves beat about polished op@@ pression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demon@@ strat@@ ors went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed forces .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some protest@@ ers attempted to impos@@ e police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not carry skirts , because otherwise you could not see what many Muslims have not !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic sp@@ ends the round , which exp@@ elled the extent of supp@@ ression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had question@@ ed the validity of the demand for a counter@@ part in question - this has been proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street .
my@@ te@@ ks Media Labs adds :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your counter@@ part !
on the road !
others indicate that protests as a further step in the fight against a government which was taken up from their point of view of the devast@@ ating economic crisis and thus prefer@@ able to hide critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take greater frequency and intensity .
some vene@@ ers reported to the media , they were an hung@@ ered to participate in a strike , rather than to work or to buy .

this is an adap@@ tive version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , an audit@@ or on August 23 , 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argentine news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kindly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced to visit his father &apos;s atro@@ cities at La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ian city Córdoba .
as a now adult man Qu@@ ij@@ ano now said in the context of the Great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba , against his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes have been investigated during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano has not chosen his life .
started with the burden such as his father to carry down to the brutal military operations in prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets for himself .
in the situation at that time I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child at 15 years , you don &apos;t notice that one is manip@@ ulated by his father .
back then I could not realise that my father was a th@@ ief , the subsequent and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 till 1983 , a time of State terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander in the prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , a supp@@ ress caused by ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder , in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the degree of atro@@ cities during the years that he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht ) against his father .
his story shows which great power has a parent &apos;s parent , and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy , mar@@ tial arts .
all of them called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo , and urged me to identify my friend .
he said :
you &apos;re a dick@@ head , you have been friends with one of the ERP .
pass , just that they don &apos;t dec@@ eive you one day , and I must save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , a Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina .
therefore he offered to go back to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my father had moved me .
at the base of the military point , I had to destroy the prisoners who had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university caps , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ w@@ and@@ am@@ at@@ erial , books , simple everything .

&apos;@@ as they are over there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me altogether four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
on the first and last time he left me in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little wrapped around a blanket and told me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great mour@@ ning silver in it .
on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were shut down and enter@@ tained me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured there .
I saw in it and saw a couch that were tor@@ tured on man .
it looked like a field of field and metal springs .
later , I found out that they paved the way an end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had been cap@@ tiv@@ ated there .
they rarely f@@ ake a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ poured it with water and sent him a load of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .
photo : Com@@ is@@ i@@ ón Provincial de la Mem@@ oria
the sten@@ ch there was f@@ oul od@@ ly ... like a dirty wind .
years later when my father was under house arrest , the same od@@ our came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in distress .
I have never forgotten that smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he took me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with palms and were tied to the eye .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people lay with the face down - all were bound of hands and feet .
near the entrance settled people quietly on the matt@@ resses .
when my father noticed that I looked to the prisoners , he said , &quot; Do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
I denied , &quot; Why did you bring me up ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero spread a man there and killed .
( according to details of survi@@ vor@@ s , Jorge Rom@@ ero who was also indicted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process were accused of death by students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
the following video is em@@ itted by Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial .
the way you came in here is also the way that they came here .
if you look on the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when torture was taken over , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra till the arrangement of above came to be re@@ located .
this was the lie - Eu@@ phr@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war spo@@ ils &apos;
my father brought all the things stolen from home .
at that age , I had no idea what the &quot; n@@ yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later at the military , I was in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps a military sign that is fought on one enemy that is fought against .

but if one goes into a house and put the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothing , paintings , money ... asc@@ end@@ eth , that is not a war of war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I always asked myself how my father , the head of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
as an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and me it would never be incur@@ red to enter a house and steal all this .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
once he called me a criminal and I said : and you , who hur@@ st the car on the street ?
you are not crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and shou@@ ted :
if you go so far , then I will find you and slay you .
we need none other to do this !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I test@@ ified in the trial , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a rolling hand kn@@ it of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a prisoner of this crime . I resist@@ ed , no problem , they can lay hold on me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to speak .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ able act &quot;
now where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life .
one develops , and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you were executed during the dictatorship . but why the bodies let disappear ?
why do children dec@@ eive ?
one day my father got a girl with his home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they would have simply put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
were these people not even families , who were able to pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ able act that you can do one person .
my father told me when democracy was again introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the remains of prisoners .
they were crushed and nowhere , no idea where ever . &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; my father said .
but anything remains , of course .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
to clear it , I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said just the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the idea to show my father arose during a conversation he was under house arrest .
I made him dig@@ ni@@ fe because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to suffer because of him .
then he said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
I felt comfor@@ ted and asked me what all the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good .
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me something ?
I saw how you killed man !
you have committed horri@@ ble crimes and you were forced me to participate .
he only question@@ ed &quot; Now then show me up . &quot;
precisely that I did .
in 2010 , I got the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can fore@@ see that I was pre@@ judi@@ ced . I eventually told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 crimes : including severe , irregular freedom of freedom in 158 cases , torture in 98 of severe cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of an under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto , a terrible car drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a center in Kyoto , where you can pro@@ long his driving licence .
this photo was dis@@ semin@@ ated in the social media .
edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers became a newly opened centre where one can pro@@ long his driving licence in the last month , witnesses of a very special translation .
on a shield the jap@@ an@@ ese word which means &quot; the older drivers &quot; means , w@@ ron@@ gly - but perhaps also with bad background thanks &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terri@@ fic drive &quot; was translated .
the wrong translation was to be read from September 1 to 20 in electronic ads in the input field and in the building itself .
edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine , the original photos used in the social media .
the mistake was like a translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ra , who was also aware of the local tim@@ ings on it .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n , which is published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; said Holmes .
this was initially a faulty English translation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; terri@@ fic drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropri@@ ately nam@@ ing term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto police ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator , and that the translation was not inspected for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was released .
a blo@@ gger told her about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are really sorry that elderly people felt off@@ ended by the in@@ sufficient correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News continued to deal with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; was approached as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the number of older drivers who are nation@@ ally involved in accidents , but are not a reason to worry .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19.@@ 460 cases of sen@@ iors were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . that equals a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 from altogether 11.@@ 850 un@@ w@@ astes .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
whereas the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors resulting in the same period have risen in the same period .
the repor@@ tedly called repor@@ ter brought the light to the light published on the Yahoo published article in Yahoo , which show the pre@@ judi@@ ces of some Japanese to older drivers :
the article on Yahoo talked about the translation mistakes was , among others , the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terri@@ fic drivers &quot; ) just about reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; in whole Asia is so widespread
translation errors are widespread in Japan and very Asia .
En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure @-@ pit for this bizarre mistake in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation defects are mani@@ fold .
we need two key skills : passive language skills , to understand the original text , and an active language skills to get him into the target language .
the latter requires the active dom@@ ination of the target language - something which is in case of native speakers . generally , convinced that trans@@ lat@@ ors should not be in the language - native language .
for example , a French native language should translate French into French - not from the French into English .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ employees with English as a native language to translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding , cost reasons or the relatively small amount of English speakers , to learn to be Japanese .
some companies who have no foreign employees , but will make translations pe@@ dest@@ ab@@ internally . then the Japanese staff , whose English language skills are perceived to become trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad its language skills are really .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the pro@@ ver@@ te@@ br@@ ate and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences that are formed by machine translation can , show that this technique can still be replaced without a human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints , often used t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for sty@@ list@@ ic reasons - not read or understood .
photo of Flickr @-@ user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation mistakes may be acceptable or at least harmless . however , by big companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source for their translations in the future .

offerings like Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular among Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ers with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant to report on the coverage of protests since 2014 , when they would continue to report on the demonstrations , when the Commission continued to report this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
with no cable TV and informative national television channels , I have logged in @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
ast@@ o@@ unding , that it &apos;s still cheaper than to buy two litres of so@@ das .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that it is not only Viv@@ op@@ lay by blocking the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online radio stations . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers their sessions .
earlier research institute for the Company of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , showed that the local network of Internet companies can sometimes use DNS . the DNS Server requests of certain domains may be er@@ ron@@ eous .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server does not reply or ref@@ uses the request when calling one such website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
in V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transmission was dis@@ continued on Thursday 6th April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V camera man Elvis Flo@@ res , who recorded the protests in Caracas , was taken into custody .
Flo@@ res was beaten while it was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V returned to broadcast again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government was regulated via YouTube : thus , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ians will always be more difficult to access multimedia reports about the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls are to become a slave to get education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ min@@ ita . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
today , Tina fights for the rights of children and g@@ athers testimony of other cri@@ ad@@ itas that were just like victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by Kur@@ haus , which will be published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , random schools ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America and re @-@ published .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household in which she did not live together with the family who lived there .
shortly before she graduated from the university , she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride on her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
those who have become something from the somewhat is , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began working as cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as cri@@ ad@@ itas proc@@ laim@@ s the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes their under@@ age son or her younger daughter to another , weal@@ thy family . in exchange the child will receive food , training and roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned , however , is that the children will have to pay for it countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that can be done within the framework of an agreement you cannot lift up .
this practice called cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widely distributed in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by great parts of society and despite numerous complaints for human rights .
after graduation , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke to Cri@@ ad@@ itas . especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - accumulated witness testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
they tried to mention things in name , as the feeling of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated by Cri@@ mean itas , is generally not guaranteed .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , who completed her daughter in the belief that they would like to complete their education , can improve their position in society and &quot; can take something out of himself , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family that takes up the girl with him and whose exploitation is just@@ i@@ fi@@ able with faith that they would give them a chance that otherwise no training would get any training and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ado
if the girl is har@@ assed , his family will learn about many years later .
sometimes they never hear about it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , has got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín was taken to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of severe impacts . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ min@@ ita in the household of former military staff Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who as an officer at the registration office .
Mar@@ ín was living with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants , located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira sl@@ ammed with a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered a deadly injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later , the media reported on the incident .
she emphas@@ ized that the murdered child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply rooted practice of the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go into the death of the girl .
they described the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest pet@@ itions that there was &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed throughout the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; failed Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
it is much easier without papers to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the wife &apos;s neighbours and almost 60 civil society organizations demanded an inquiry into the event .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her cri@@ ad@@ ita to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be inci@@ dental - if for the first time in history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ mean az@@ go will occur in court .
the everyday life of a cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ bs are not only explo@@ ited as labour , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k in which her father worked , bank@@ rupt and her father lost his job .
their brothers had to work all the work and started to sell on the street or market cuisine to earn money .
but they all continued to school .
only Tina was sent as cri@@ ad@@ ita to the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to split the time so that you still had time for learning .
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
Fri@@ days , for example , pur@@ ified the refrigerator , cleaned the living room , polished furniture and also the ground .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time for learning .
the more she was done with learning , the more leisure time she had .
but this time was limited , because they had to have dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she never had to star@@ ve , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to fet@@ ch more books from the house of the landlord as food from the fridge . &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ant of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ um@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in addition to him stand and Editorial re@@ acts from Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ aries , such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media .
but he was standing for intelligent , but didn &apos;t enter@@ tain himself with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who heard it while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they had allowed the education that they had allowed to lose , explain it .
she , however , was perfectly clear that she had paid for everything she had paid with her hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was disc@@ rimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing , which almost never spoken , are bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ ad@@ itas when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , cri@@ cket is cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not invite anyone home to me . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time where friend@@ ships develop , I felt very clear that I did not belong to any group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
Society appro@@ ves the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group where you can place vac@@ an@@ cies for cleaning personnel and children in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is P@@ EPA Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a town tin in the As@@ unci@@ on district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who play in the morning and afternoon with her .
learning to learn .
please call you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad was five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from leaving Ñ@@ em@@ in wrote that she would have been an old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , which also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old nie@@ ce . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the country , which would like to work . &quot;
then turn the editor of the display once again :
love friends , I found one . I look if it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the shop was fin@@ alized .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ mean itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ mean itas , like long still ? ) , a collection of witness statements , former cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to be ens@@ l@@ ately rep@@ ented and the system of the Men@@ s@@ ú ( in whom the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to be rep@@ ented ) and the system of the Men@@ s@@ ú gained in a system of slavery , where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to the understanding of the phenomenon known as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill , Egyptian users write social media to sign up at the government

six@@ ty Egyptian parliamentary groups recently ordered a bill to &quot; &quot; regul@@ ars &quot; regarding use and user social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of the law a place would be established , which is thus commissioned to share social media use .
within six months with acceptance of the law , users and users had to register with their correct names and identity numbers to use social networks .
if this is missed , this could bring a fine of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill , consisting of six subjects and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is running and used through the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video address and text . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ler , MP and Supp@@ orters of the Legisl@@ ative Assembly , registered user names and users , received a username and a password in order to get blocked by the fire@@ wall . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to them it would be necessary to submit information on her identity to access the network .
but so far , it is not known that such plans are sub@@ du@@ ed .
experts on @-@ site experts are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ ist , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( based on German &quot; senior Resear@@ chers &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R ) , German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly for the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , it is so special that just as it for@@ ci@@ bly control physical and private spaces it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must be discussed at the Legisl@@ ative Assembly and the Constitutional Affairs before it comes to the plenary debate .
whether his acceptance and dism@@ iss@@ al will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military idea in parliament , whose sense is to maxim@@ ize and ensure that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ ist .
in the past year , the Parliament of the Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ cht@@ y adopted a bill against Cy@@ ber @-@ Crime , which was found guilty of life imprisonment for those who are found guilty of threat@@ ening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the Kurdistan Hills in the north east of Iraq , the Tier@@ schutz@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the NGOs of NGOs work to the state of the non @-@ governmental organization of Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ard ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus SA sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are endangered because of po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as it may always find less lo@@ ot .
why is this certain kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
like Raz@@ a in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining smo@@ ker in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem , &quot; and the health and the awareness of the ecos@@ ystem can also depend on that a big pre@@ dat@@ ory is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in fact can be seen in the wild , and goes against zero . when the team in the video showed that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ olog@@ in Raz@@ a is passionate about another side of her country , which is not only war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan Regional region .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o responsible for the north @-@ east Japan , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , had been adv@@ o@@ cating the lives that had been hit by the &quot; Thir@@ ty disaster &quot; in March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an at@@ om accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened .
the K@@ ah@@ oc@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o paper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , which lies in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was one of the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan , which had to do both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring islands of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had all the coastal cities of the map .
even more recently the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture still had an accident accident , but only about 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the Special Report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows a local view that progress has been reached for six years , to re@@ build the life of the city .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
the apartment complex in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( in which sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ n ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were finished .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could see Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 per cent of the planned spare buildings were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima joined the final light in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
even though , six years after the disaster , one ende@@ avo@@ red to be evacu@@ ated by co@@ hab@@ it , and to change mit@@ ig@@ su y@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) of final replacement houses .
after the thre@@ e@@ fold disaster , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such Beh@@ aus@@ ungen .
nearly 40 percent of the evacu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergen@@ cies , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated , which were hau@@ gh@@ ted after the disaster , were moved to final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
how the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by the disaster in December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , only 30 percent of fishing ports operate their operation .
ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , involved in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land , have been involved .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land used in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that only a result of the atomic fact is , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lying in the nuclear power zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered far away , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima still stays far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same stand as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima can now have only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coast people , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine the overall image , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacu@@ ations . they question@@ ed about the status of re@@ building and also how their feeling is changed compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o explains :
the K@@ ah@@ oc@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local population has taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those respon@@ dents have still not been done enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
as it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture ,
in her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the position of evacu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture also witnessed the worst , dis@@ asters , atomic accident that had to be experienced in Japan .
about 63 000 evacu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima were installed in the areas outside the pre@@ fecture , almost 63 000 people from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
in early 2016 , a little more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , have been res@@ ett@@ led to permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 stand still 40 000 inhabitants live on Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of its home pre@@ fecture .
in emergen@@ cies the majority of the evacu@@ ated areas of war are most likely to rep@@ ay them . they have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima , with massive construction projects , which are part of the Olympic Games , which will be part in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
however , after a while we often see that it connects more than it at first sight .
these global connections are important because they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives , and remind us of the fact that the world is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we discuss topics that often get less attention as they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone above language and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man refers to how love for the music f@@ ain@@ ted her aff@@ ection in rural China ; Adri@@ ana Mac@@ ia talks about the time where she has worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being joined by the police in the large demonstrations

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was included in the intensive care unit this week , with a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nation@@ wide , millions of demon@@ strat@@ ors took part in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the university of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
doctors accredited him this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos from the attack on Mat@@ eus , that spread rapidly within a few days swi@@ ft in Brazil .
the face of the police officers can also identify the face of the police officer , which was identified with a stro@@ ve . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation .
the pictures show the police officers , as he performs in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with its impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officers were beaten by a demon@@ strat@@ ors , and would end up on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire supp@@ ression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ er@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video from Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , attacked by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , being attacked by the police officer and several sanitary very soon to hur@@ ry .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
the clip shown below shows the attack on mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ lians ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) in order to make some of the costs of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police power . &quot;
the drawing was distributed repeatedly in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me was murdered by his father , because he was attacked the Occup@@ y Movement in secondary schools , and now we have been attacked by a very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen , who attacked him with a stroke .
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where the past Friday came to brutal police par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s against demon@@ strat@@ ors .
police officers were in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers had constructed a stage for redund@@ an@@ ages , rubber floors and lac@@ ri@@ p@@ as .
Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Order ( PS@@ OL ) asked the police to aband@@ on violence against demon@@ strat@@ ors .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media streets have been tra@@ vers@@ ed by focusing on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo has reported specifically to a broken glass window to illustr@@ ate their title pages as illustr@@ ative .
but the O Glob@@ o l@@ apped a title story with a set @-@ on bus .
there is no plau@@ sible reason to report more through a broken window screen than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special thing .
one must also realize this if you are strictly opposed to any form of damage .
&quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; too , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets a absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate significance , and the typical violence of the military police are question@@ ed with the title &quot; protest@@ ers on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot;
the Un@@ ction of For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , close to hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba kno@@ cked the doors ( Photo : Julio B@@ atist@@ a )
the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there is no notable sugar harvest on site .
it &apos;s two years ago when the activities were l@@ aded in the sugar cane mill .
after rising the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost its systems until only the frame was left of steel and concrete .
approximately 272 workers had to re@@ invent itself .
some changed the work .
others re@@ sign and comm@@ ute every day to the factories , which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , rising every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not make his sleep .
he heard that there is still in the east of the region of sugar cane manufactured after a long in@@ active period because they were obtained .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but that promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry ur@@ ts the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for this country a few decades ago , but the bad harvest has been no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane powered ?
the old railway tracks of the church saw better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they became un@@ lock@@ able for the country .
initial idea was to concentrate production on most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories and they can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the mot@@ if@@ s that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nonetheless the sugar price increased again about a decade ago .
from 2017 until 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Land@@ wirtschaft@@ skammer Fil@@ ters &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Food organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate roughly 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s Day will be with security in history , &quot; that was the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene as a soldier is known as a soldier , is talking about the closure of the factory , is the word that he repe@@ ats most , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents say that the same opinion was not one of them informed that the factory would shut down .
thus , they formed a full time working group .
before the opening year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially licensed documents that would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , addressing the date and the date .
all of those were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any decision .
from then on , responsibility and letters came more and more common .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was in charge of two years for the l@@ act@@ ate factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money &quot; covered by the sugar cane factories .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in his will at the re@@ sign@@ ation of the factory , whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he demonstrated one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important jobs was eliminated .
in many cases , no alternatives for working stations and services were generated in the municipalities in which they were created .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ ut @-@ speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present persons , when it was not working for the areas whose factories would not have been running well for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is only extracted by Mah@@ len .
( photo : Julio B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years the parish of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned to change many things , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane castle closed , or better said when they started to end them , they also listened to asp@@ hal@@ ted the street , and also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search for other factories .
they were issued to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people also left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .
nin@@ ety @-@ forty harvest@@ ing of the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month , to spend the years in the retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a tran@@ spir@@ ing person , yet he gives the lies that they told him not .
they &apos;ve been killing him for ten years .
N@@ ene works at 65 years in pension , not because it is missing in force , but because he is bitter .

first Nations Young people use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording of a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people from the First Nations Community Communities in Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them . they do they with Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop manager mobile sound studios have been offering directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate young song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then co@@ operated with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in talks , such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever could be found in the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which you@@ ths are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ ll@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road@@ map in West@@ kan@@ ada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely unknown .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to medi@@ ate , as import@@ ing traditional customs and customs of war despite the influence of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , even though the young people do not always domin@@ ate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ h@@ i Cre@@ e first nation has recorded , refra@@ in will be sung at Cre@@ e .
the young people , who participated here , received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip Hop Group , who gave them a st@@ anza in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the st@@ anza is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like I wouldn &apos;t ever be interested in me .
but I try to continue my days on earth .
that is the day where you will take our scre@@ am
because we have lost our way of life in life
but I believe that we will rise up one day .
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
so they can grow and lead to our youth
so they can do that for what purpose of the Creator ,
in the commentary part , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ Language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also provides a post and add the st@@ anza in Sil@@ ben@@ z ( which is also published on his blog and published here with approval ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
to show potential customers , what is exactly on the menu , will be in the proximity of the entrance to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( which seem to be present in the restaurant &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of each dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic dishes , then decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant .
there is an entire industry devoted to manufacturing these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo District of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a variety of these small companies that just produce those plastic dishes , which documented the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most of Japan , these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they don &apos;t even invite them anymore . a new trend , however , is transformed into show@@ y mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ters , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a number of social media links and photos which show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin rolling pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new with plastic dishes decorated phone tapes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ yo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , cold barrier magnets :
here are a few Sho@@ es Ku@@ pres@@ so magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in essence is increasingly difficult .
in this case , a ka@@ ans @-@ don ( a popular route with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone support .
this part is also made for the exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that delivers your mobile phone :
designed to display like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the country .
some mobile devices and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon has been s@@ wind@@ ated , a popular t@@ opping with white rice is served .
on Twitter some users had their doub@@ ts :
there &apos;s somebody who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile @-@ stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and kn@@ it bands from dried salmon .
other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ching blog post . or follow on Twitter using the h@@ ash@@ tag #
if you would like to know more about the origin of the trends , then this video gives you an insight into the quarter K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which dev@@ otes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry . such as with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories about survi@@ vor@@ s of struggle against organised crime
&quot; the victims of struggle against &quot; drug traff@@ ic@@ kers &quot; victims .

in reports of national and foreign media on the not@@ ori@@ ous &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking in Mexico &quot; the mi@@ xes and the killed regularly appear in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy that brings the struggle with himself .
the report on drug war@@ bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ al@@ oa cartridge , th@@ ron@@ es the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background .
on the day following a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mo@@ urn or the churches which have learned to live with pain .
behind each glue , behind every bone finds in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , boys and friends , friends and partners , their w@@ ounds can never be healed .
this is why the Mexican news portal Tri@@ p@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ il@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; dealing with the drug traff@@ icking &quot; ) , that told these victims , and stories about people who are caught in the struggle between the prosec@@ utions of authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime will not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ic@@ kers and whole congregations will need to drive many kilometers to something as many as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bo@@ th@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear changes &quot; ) is telling these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez pleaded not to her father only one day , her si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of their ne@@ phe@@ w .
priest : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have been ready to go and searching for graves , to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 , he left the house .
October 15th , he was supposed to be back , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is my mother , too , who is also with me here .
at the moment , she has no income .
you are entitled to an insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they are asking a death certificate .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ro@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we have to show only the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility , and state guidance .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a readers of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never consider normal , in whatever form it appears :
I have been acquain@@ ted with disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism since a few years now .
I pass every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with images that can actually come from a text@@ book for Cri@@ min@@ ology or files from specialists .
it takes me from the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is wi@@ dened or sad . it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to the body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider it as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin will think that he is great ( German : drug traff@@ icker ) if he is great . and it is also not normal that people will hear songs over the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the perpet@@ rators if they go through the streets .
for me , it is like those who have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear of them that happens so something .
I see our weakness when stories are becoming blo@@ gging numbers in a statist@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to persu@@ ade them to stay away from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the report &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the Capital District : like a family with threats , it describes how armed crime broke out for month &apos;s money till it was not only destroyed business , but also their family torn apart .
you think about everything you &apos;ve lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain will never exp@@ ire , the trau@@ ma remains , fear comes again , when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are from each other , the better .
she included her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they kill or kill you .
I wonder@@ ed in those terrible days if I would like to dissolve my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , for I forgot to live like you cri@@ es . I must learn to live with pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence marked by violence . &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it , in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he rel@@ ates that he had to teach himself how to make an egg , potatoes cooked , tort@@ illas and warm &quot; ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of vial with water , sugar and milk powder .
he talks about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ utter@@ able for a boy to whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he had only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody car@@ che of his father was killed by armed men out of a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation looked like in Ju@@ á@@ rez :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence committed by organized crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders on public security and the government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public pro@@ secutor counted 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to average of 8,5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invaded the soul of the country .
few stories still live in view of always new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ il@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; initiated the journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades .

&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flickr member of Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages that he link , include images on which violence is depicted .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it comes to raising a rum@@ or or un@@ fold a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what is the years after the first sur@@ faced ? content in social media , no matter whether true or true , tend to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it has been used to educ@@ ate trage@@ dies , which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of photo and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies no fact that there is a lot of careful reporting about events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but there is a question about our longing for pictures on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , st@@ oned and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been negle@@ cted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become more difficult to drive fighting , which were difficult to drive .
ir@@ on@@ ically , the fuel tank fell victim to the fuel tank .
the Government officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinem@@ as near , that was full of people watching the World Cup .
the houses burned down and scattered cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to im@@ parti@@ ality .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ more photos of the previous day are the most horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
there are rows of low bodies lined up on the floor while looking at them .
but here the story does not find its end .
the same photo was m@@ ashed several times over the years on social media , blogs and other platforms , but is in@@ correctly attributed to real life , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the un@@ occupied Nig@@ eri@@ an sett@@ lements of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on on 3 January 2015 .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses report dra@@ stically from atro@@ cities , in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and bodies were in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports of which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
however , the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses &quot; said a person to Human Rights Watch .
many were carved , shot or burned .
only by satellite images the follow @-@ time could be depicted .
the occasion for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am military to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerge from the DR Congo , as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ authorized ten@@ ders ; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria as of 2014 .
in all these cases the image was introduced as a proof of mass econom@@ ies .
yet another step further provides personal comments , such as this example , in the DRC with sources of mass media related to the sources of mass media .
the picture of San@@ ge has also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning bolt , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee , ra@@ pe and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , post@@ finance such as the following on how these descriptions made with photos from the DRC :
this picture was taken by an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which said in 2012 that President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ ein I said , mon@@ ks and politicians would have been involved in the assassin@@ ation of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , the AF@@ P as their source , had likewise attributed to His being this statement , but were not associated with the image of the DR Congo .
the global range of false information
traces of this false coupling are to date back to the years 2011 and 2012 , and actually come from anywhere around the world .
using an &quot; revers@@ ed picture search &quot; you can see how far information can be exceeded .
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the previous picture of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h private sites , platforms of social media and communal areas and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have ro@@ uted false reports , others have attempted to un@@ fold the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
we have jurisdiction for the mis@@ use of use and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they have been published . thus , we want to display the range more clearly than by language alone .
several examples of mis@@ use are incur@@ red from the listed countries ( which are also associated with each other in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can be stopped now ( on the map in orange ) :

Malaysia provides two extreme examples for the impro@@ per use of the image of the DR Congo , with one part a twe@@ et , the sympathy compared to the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand a blo@@ g@@ gers that are persec@@ uted to del@@ ig@@ ate the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , as the photos were used im@@ properly .

the Myanmar government issued a correc@@ t@@ ness to make them as &quot; deliber@@ ately f@@ ing@@ ed news and photos , the international media , international human rights organization and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings concerning Myanmar . &quot;

this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , presents it clearly that the image of the DRC has NOT been Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page said that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein being dismissed in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and the painting is still present in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article by 2014 relating to students that were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic near @-@ standing news page an@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declar@@ es that the picture does not come from the k@@ illings , but it claims that it is a similar d@@ schi@@ p assault attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in conjunction with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there was links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fertili@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns the world ) .
the picture of the DR Congo showed , with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion under Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities found this inci@@ dents that took place in the name of Islam , bigger attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was referred to as proof for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more then 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ aving ) , but the messages which were connected with it were taken in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly au@@ tho@@ red by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Pascal &quot; over the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were over discussion forums like this here on Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to fal@@ se@@ hood .
the organisation of the Clar@@ inet Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Martos was dis@@ soci@@ ated from the embassy in which the image was contained in the DRC .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , ag@@ gregate and sides in the following countries ( on the folder in Gray ) has also not fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data income with URLs and time@@ frames and dat@@ est@@ amps exist on the web cra@@ wler and then they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya ocean . )
in all these cases that previously appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture finally bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or available .
frames and images
there are two strong themes and frames ( frames ) that pass this post . the first frame focuses on Religion .
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions about silence in connection with the assassin@@ ation of Christians through Muslims or - in the defence of Muslims - assassin@@ ation of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how to under@@ estimate an African life in comparison to a European or French life .
religion do not want to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it &apos;s worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers may no longer grant this pictures longer .
with social media , there are many people who are in@@ advert@@ ently advert@@ ently to tr@@ ample the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ars this mood of false and fal@@ se@@ hood information that are real atro@@ cities un@@ true and tast@@ ed it the real atro@@ cities that actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of for@@ ci@@ ble pictures was already deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that the back of pictures of a ref@@ usal is to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images will even be asked by the victims itself .
at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures readers and spect@@ uses are des@@ iring to feel emp@@ athy ( such as such a study conducted among others to help others ) .
while there is a lot to be discuss@@ ing over the news media , the fact that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
Techn@@ ologist would need to experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; which , in which a picture suggests a somewhat suggests , which is actually replaced by the context or completely mis@@ used manner .
any investigation of false breeding , however , should also consider how internationally they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller tongues
photo by Andy Simm@@ ons using the CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Im@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( Z. B. inde@@ struc@@ tible ) tries to offer voice enthusiasts to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Saudi @-@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but they all resist a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation as well as something context is required to understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite some time .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and Lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ transc@@ end@@ able &quot; Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages .
in the blog , one finds words from the M@@ anu@@ at@@ u &apos;s tax @-@ lap as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Pra@@ ise your parents in recognition of what stri@@ ves to have tried for you in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - con@@ convenience or sl@@ oth , which you feel after you war@@ med up on cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words out of his blog About :
they s@@ ne@@ ak other cultures , un@@ veil another ideas and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes , you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to show more this &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and present how different , valuable , and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by trans@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka linked with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is the worst floo@@ ding and cat@@ astro@@ phic floods in this decade .
fired by the mon@@ soon , which is normally set in late May , rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have step@@ ped into the south and west of the country via the banks .
after a statement by the disaster of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundred people were missed because of the floods and mud pots .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( May 26 ) and about 100 000 people have been placed at 304 appropriate position .
the rainf@@ alls were gradually left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , while the water levels went slowly in some areas .
health and hygiene items of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos show an impression of the scale of flood disaster :
high tide in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ - and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods devast@@ ates the Den@@ gu@@ ef@@ ie@@ ving crisis , the Save the Children , after further down@@ fall is already on their way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa was standing in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ag@@ as near G@@ alle also flooded the mor@@ ale of the Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue actions and five are made for transporting emergency supplies for the residents finished in their flooded villages .
also , different organizations and start@@ ups have agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ IMS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Designer - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if there are any search and life@@ jack@@ ets d@@ ron@@ es need for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ uf @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ence Center will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; high water aid , &quot; which allowed it users allowed to pick a vehicle to be picked up by assistance and don@@ ating donations . these were then directed to the sr@@ c Red Cross .
they also launched a &quot; SOS &quot; key that had more than thousands of en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat actions for flood victims included .
the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , bring inhabitants into trouble and afford help us@@ ages .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , with the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to recovery the norm@@ ality .

I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has established itself in their imagination .
they Muslim me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion different .
we identify ourselves with that Muslim , to different species . but somehow we all are put in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in it , become Muslim .
to become Muslim Brotherhood
I am not strug@@ gling with it alone .
this even happened to the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come to one in the sense when one thinks of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western style religion was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ etion makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
another exists in the reduced images of Muslims , which had been colon@@ ized by western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man that you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the pione@@ ering Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ vised the story behind these paintings .
but these images still rise further .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood remain they continued .
I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I saw how these powerful , incorrect nar@@ r@@ atives have dominated our news@@ feeds .
this nar@@ r@@ ative sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that has led to nine Muslim women through their countries over the last three decades , while the U.S. in 2016 could not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this sc@@ r@@ ative will fail to realize that if French , Muslim women are prevented from applying her head@@ scarf into public buildings and to cover su@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover its entire body , that both are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group does not exercise his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; others . &quot;
this powerful nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil from Afri@@ cans , which were brought along with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this nar@@ r@@ ative has become deeply and fla@@ wed , so often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children become the target of in@@ tim@@ us@@ li@@ mic attacks and ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ings .
because of those stories we tell us and because of the way we tell them is Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia not only fear of Islam , the religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
which belong to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we are doing more than just stories based on facts .
or to alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ r@@ atives , which help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed because it failed to capture the sc@@ ars of the 1.7 billion .
and here we have failed , where seven million Muslims he@@ ats up the &quot; religious group &quot; in America .
more than one @-@ third of all Muslim population are African mut@@ iny .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my parents worked in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; built by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan failed the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were sore Muslims and Americans .
but now I am im@@ mov@@ able Muslims and Americans ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say , instead of my Muslim recipes or put my hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs that all Muslims bear in themselves - &quot; from respect to Pepp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I jo@@ ze , we do not wear all bags or@@ ns with us .
we do not have to be a the@@ ological expert in order to be a Muslim &quot; or to be always selected for additional security checks in the airport .
there are hundreds of Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists , and religious activists who ende@@ av@@ our to fight and fight popular lies on Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ temper@@ ed Islam@@ ist machine , think tanks and experts for false information which is our already f@@ law@@ less picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manip@@ ulated .
because of the stories we tell us and because of the way we tell them , there is a host@@ ility in more than just a stranger that r@@ ots up a woman .
or as the terri@@ fying card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .

Islam@@ ists in its ugly forms attacks our sub@@ ordination .
it attacks our identity , which is vast , so versatile and complex that it can be impossible to fit in a drawer .

use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born when I was born to my imagination then , when I was four years old , in a provis@@ ional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they relate to the following terms : believe , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be seen , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my rock in the surf , can see that I am Muslims when they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the sole ritual with my daughter when I kept her in my arms , and to prevent the Arab verses to protect the Kor@@ an and be called Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat every one of them three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see , and the evil that you can &apos;t see .
my Muslim faith may not always be seen , but my Muslim Brotherhood is always part of my shadow .

it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; that takes largely Arab and Muslims to Vis@@ ier .

because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of Nor@@ th@@ western University members showed a scientific image and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .

we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the f@@ law@@ less and dangerous explo@@ sives that we are missing in our news actions .

but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time , in which we are .
and that moment has consequences which dropped from 1.7 billion euros .
there is one reason that con@@ spi@@ racy theore@@ ti@@ cians who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group , which has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by being created the &quot; others &quot; .

initiative for nar@@ rative art wants to preserve urban language diversity

can there be a possibility to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , the founder of the initiative of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is an answer to stories in their original language .
global Vo@@ ices said recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the In@@ disp@@ rop@@ able blog .
here , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and stran@@ gle the language variety of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , is risk that small and not quite as small languages can not be shared with children born there .
for the part of the project :
the mass mortality of the world &apos;s language may be avoided , if we want cities to assume diversity - safe rooms in which residents do not forget who they are to belong in .
while &quot; listen is often associated with understanding , &quot; reward these events instead &quot; listening to este@@ em , make , and make . &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers return their story first in their own language and translate them and then explain them in English .
even though the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their surrender means and their presentation that list@@ eners allow to be in@@ audible .
they call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou had also taken the opportunity to explain the customs of nar@@ rative of their country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak from bun@@ ni@@ es and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after expl@@ aining the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara will be asked : &quot; how is it possible to speak to a crowd that does not understand your language ? &quot; he shares his sense of in@@ consistency :
they listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were completely with me !
so far the events of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling in three cities took place , and the organiz@@ ers hope to expand this . all that are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the USA re@@ constitution of state debt
with the aim of a new testing of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which accounts for 72 million US dollars on a mass rally ; the march took part in the army of the capital Capit@@ ol , the capital building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
proclaimed by the group@@ ing of Fren@@ chman Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da , &quot; ( the Civil front for the Neur@@ u@@ ation of Deb@@ t ) and the Ö@@ Com@@ en@@ ian Church in Puerto Rico .
the adv@@ o@@ cates of the debt restructuring have also submitted an pet@@ ition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto R@@ ican calls for politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies that are responsible for their debts to their corruption .
we demand financial examination and a leadership committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions such re@@ mun@@ eration that ag@@ ulates in favour of the economy .
we are expres@@ sing and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ ican refused to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not take off with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand instant measures .
the island - not in the United States State level - suff@@ ers from a heavy financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a gover@@ ning non @-@ profit organization without party membership with focus on the soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state authority .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto R@@ os require a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
the measures imposed on the outside are run without the participation and convic@@ tion of the citizens of danger to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration was named &quot; night guard for light and truth . &quot;

the Syrian Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is missing a year for over one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members put the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network .
during this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , annual conference for digital culture , hosted in Berlin , was devoted to the event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ ri@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints &apos; completed books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the Book Prize of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ ge ( The Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive Research ) .
the book published last year and here is free of charge , includes a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of supp@@ ression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
this book aims to identify how movements are constructed for free knowledge and what the real costs are linked to which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , researchers and writers , who are involved in the movements of free knowledge , have side on page to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to create something sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the Bel@@ oved and celebrated Internet Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er , which has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of the Ad@@ ra pris@@ ons , which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Colle@@ ctive memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us start thinking about their own destiny , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time @-@ making extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for Open Source and Digital activ@@ ist has been the term of Syrian government agencies for March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel had taken the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Court out of his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi told that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , which stood by himself as the in@@ sider of the Assad administration and put them knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
the where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in establishing access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ician and at the moment the leader of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le cultural prototypes were more fo@@ aming than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the pione@@ ering of various civi@@ liz@@ ations and here mer@@ ges gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel had not yet known that for ten years after he began working with this work , that IS it all about doing this architecture , em@@ bo@@ died not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this stri@@ pe into the digital archae@@ ology and the preservation has created a time capsule , which will be in@@ valuable to the public and for acade@@ m@@ ics and artists in the future .
according to this project , Bas@@ sel had not finished yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life with them , as dre@@ aming , and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel taught me English , even when he was already in prison .
I have learned to read and speak English well .
he always has his knowledge , which he asked . he taught others to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened me the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without which it actually stopped in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in prison .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for a year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him , and he translated them from Arabic to English .
the book is licensed free .
book covers from Yous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book written by Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens at every visit ,
that I see in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace you ,
that doesn &apos;t matter to me any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , bonds and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the feeling of the prison
and I went into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion ,
if your eyes will say farewell
and I leave you another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to reg@@ ain all those moments ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I witness myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
a year passes , my soul
while on the
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of the Monster
so , history is not unique in Syria .
according to the protests against the Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads regime , in 2011 , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 65@@ ,000 people disappeared .
those who were arrested , or executed under violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured or executed .
since 2011 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians died in prison according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today , we repeat our demand in the hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption , director of the post uph@@ eld re @-@ release again
Mos@@ ambique acted with anger to a corrupt , in which a government member went back after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus , in which the corruption was committed .
this is where Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other accused , sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other accused .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose Council became Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
cam@@ b@@ aza was set free in 2016 for a good leadership and immediately called his return to the company , which took place on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which gave the request , there would be no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza to re @-@ relate to his old post , since the company had no discipline relating to his detention .
however , many people are not doing the action well .
the centre of public integrity ( Centro de Inte@@ gri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , an local institution , which def@@ ends itself to public transparency , sentenced to an interview with Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company to put the director again :
poses a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and emphas@@ ises the lack of transparency and even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , thus the C@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the firm , however , apparently has no adequate legal steps to apply the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Muslim social media , ref@@ uses this behaviour and considered the case as a &quot; ref@@ usal &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , he would be sent@@ ed after he was sentenced to a prison sentence .
he could pay paid spe@@ e@@ ches and motiv@@ ating spe@@ e@@ ches , he could advise and to po@@ ise his image .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users in@@ justice
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ peas or sp@@ ell@@ age .

according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is normally used to refer to people East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective .
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or , hand @-@ hand ( in bur@@ ial Scrip@@ tures ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the H@@ ass@@ language in Burma in the social network .
in recent years the rise has given rise to radical nation@@ alist movements in the word .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a h@@ ass@@ ess@@ ation against Muslims who are a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight h@@ ass@@ le in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
today , Kal@@ ar &apos;s usually might be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself doesn &apos;t call H@@ ass@@ in automatically .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people also reported that , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doub@@ ts to express its use , cen@@ sored .
moreover , there are several bur@@ ial words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , what the same letters contains , as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ k@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was now deleted , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in wit@@ ty ways if they couldn &apos;t know how he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a voc@@ abulary .
the set ku la - &quot; Healing &quot; ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but its context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ AS is the opinion that she will decrease radical nation@@ alists , but stressed that Facebook analy@@ tics , before it del@@ etes it all posts that de@@ duce rac@@ ism from rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar . &quot;
this automatically filters the word .
the automat@@ ism will not understand what you write to Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead , check the post carefully and check it by checking the words above .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( sphere of age ) .
the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread the language , get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to be pr@@ un@@ ing to nation@@ alism .
while the action you like to send a strong signal to all the H@@ ass@@ language , the efficiency of this strategy should not be maintained long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have often been demonstrated that users of social networks will just start to use a new word , or an alternative sp@@ elling of the same word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook started to delete his post@@ ings as he just wanted to share his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform about my Facebook friends that the word is blocked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from the li@@ ken , post and sharing of content for 24 hours , because the Post &quot; doesn &apos;t pay the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a multitude of posts about people who have no negative views , or just try to show their opinions against the radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed , which has nothing to do with H@@ ass@@ in :
post without h@@ ass@@ any of Facebook removed .
in the post , the author shared his mind about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Chan My@@ ae Khan believes that Facebook is supposed to have more would do before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community asked for advice :
Facebook like a ben@@ evol@@ ent aim to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
to blame such words will only bring more hat@@ red within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they started with no local context or technical support and such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Patri@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; have been forbidden .
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the for@@ ci@@ dated Post@@ s .
if they would have more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a big turnover , it would be great .
fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has taken care of much sp@@ it among the users .
instead of taking it serious , users now make fun of Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of H@@ ass@@ language to see if their posts are removed from the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook post@@ ings which have no h@@ ass@@ le ab@@ stain@@ ed but still removed :

in the last five years extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , social networks have used to expand their voices and influence , increasing .
in social networks , social networks should also heat violence in the municipalities of Myanmar in particular , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area where thousands were forced to escape between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s thousands of refugees .
Facebook has been critical for his failure to investig@@ ate balancing h@@ ass@@ le on his bur@@ ial sites .
but rather than simply turning the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better in regard to context than on @-@ code @-@ concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned them from them .
within Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is concluded with the kids before
a wedding ring in the sand .

the Children &apos;s Church is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago and Tobago now .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a law that aims to ban this practice , so that the full age of age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the adul@@ ter@@ ment , some members of Hindu and Muslim communities were gathered in practice , and in May 2016 she came to a large public out@@ cry . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leaders of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state does not inter@@ fere with the maturity of maturity . &quot;
this was evident from the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contrac@@ ting partner of the UN &apos;s Child Convention ; the min@@ ors as , for every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 the Statist@@ ical Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that were ende@@ av@@ oured to abol@@ ish laws on child &apos;s before , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . und@@ oub@@ tedly they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hindu leaders , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s before , they should take care of their own business . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition at@@ ched to tension in this un@@ complicated case , and at some point doub@@ ts came up if the opposition would agree to the bill .
but early in 2017 the bill was decided against child before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent which he contained in a House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must appro@@ ve and proc@@ laim the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which picked up the Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of bill against child before was approved at the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes in favour , and not only one of them .
when he was previously decided in the Senate , the project can now become a law .
the majority of the social media user was thr@@ illed because the laws have been changed for children before .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a Minister of Ministers in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary talk used that has spur@@ red the core of the cause , but do you know what ? the children before is in Trinidad and Tobago now illeg@@ ally , and that is worth every price .
while Abel Jackson was the mind , it was definitely long enough to create the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : idea , Excell@@ ent news !
the adul@@ tery has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 on this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
the Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society which is right openly about the adoption of the law , noted :
the age of age in Trinidad and Tobago must now be independent from the religious affili@@ ation of 18 years .
the draft to change the copyright Act was approved today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 members of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , 35 of which were present at the vote .
all members who were committed to the law have voted for the law .
the Children &apos;s Church is not permitted by law in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ ots par@@ don .
thanks to all the activists who have consp@@ ired against him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
but a possible hook is therefore in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , which is the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the well @-@ known Hindu organization of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judi@@ cial steps , should the law be adopted and it seems to come into its promises .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a fe@@ eder of the law , said it was quite legitim@@ ately , if Mahar@@ aj was against the law , for most social media users , you would wish to change the debate differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell thought :
dear Sat , if we are taking place instead of discuss@@ ing the discussion , in a way that we would say , instead of talking about the problem , that we might need to inform the state into our bedroom , that they may be ab@@ used by big , hard @-@ hard men who are against them in advantage , would you be ready to carry out the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not about a problem ?
but if there is a judi@@ cial procedure against the law , or not , this law is an important step - but there are still places in the world on which the children &apos;s before in different gra@@ d@@ ations are legal or remain the norm , even though there laws exists .

on Sunday early , the Office of the Office of the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News told that they were h@@ acked .
by the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content .
the Wikipedia article was published on 18 January 2012 , contra@@ dic@@ tory on the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally bl@@ acked .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month Turkey closed the popular and crowd @-@ out en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia ( Wikipedia ) .
the day is more obvious , how important the platform for users is to find and share useful information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the lock .
although many independent Internet users are used to use re@@ locking tools for blocked websites ( a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , the most common Wikipedia users did not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been closed from Wikipedia in 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University have been regularly reviewed after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) .
after China , Turkey is the most well @-@ known country in the world , when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ orship from Wikipedia .
as the platform remains closed , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform put off all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its dec@@ entr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( so calcul@@ ator machine computers ) , which does not make any c@@ ens@@ orship in the system of domain names .
however , the content is irre@@ voc@@ able despite the legal ban .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after we heard the messages ( via the lock of Wikipedia ) , we put all about snapshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform , so the possibility of reading the content on dec@@ entr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they don &apos;t have the website of www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ a.org .
IP@@ FS also contributed that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia project , and it just concerns screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ ten@@ der@@ .org , a mir@@ ror@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to ho@@ ist similar mirrors , when in the country Wikipedia is blocked .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and employee of Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
there is no complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
one access@@ es a different URL , which is not the original . that what one then sees is from Wikipedia .
by essence , the server is leading the application on the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia by yourself , when they are locked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wild photographer uses his camera to alert the need for nature conservation

photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ rat Gir@@ i was with the photos he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned mot@@ if@@ s and washed colours .
the motivated him to carry him a camera in itself , trying to gra@@ ze the situation .
at that time he was one child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar is trying to bring Nept@@ une to the international stage .
and its homeland is right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that di@@ vert attention to Nep@@ als wildlife .
he described on Facebook , as this first class location helps with his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it give better for a passionate wild photographer ! !
I just rested at home , when suddenly Navar@@ aj had invited me ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) and got a call from my father , that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the River dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was , and I immediately began sque@@ e@@ zing pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar as@@ sists in cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal as nature and want to deep@@ en the understanding of the wild animals that wild animals are not as terri@@ fying as they look .
and he should know it , because he already stood face to face to face ,
a tiger cannot be distur@@ b by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also , because of the darkness , I was on the way home , when the King of the Bu@@ he@@ avi@@ k appeared . he sits upon us and he sat on with the Sal trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to take in Bar@@ dia National Park photos of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist arrivals .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding , it was for the first time to speak Indian women the name of their hus@@ bands .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organization from India .
a revised version was re@@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with great care prevent the name of their hus@@ bands or even more from older men in the family .
instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
by Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h , women give to respect the husband on the basis of the social pressure , and fear of the consequences ought to dis@@ regard these practice in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of the Indian state of O@@ mel@@ a by a sh@@ atter@@ ing speech and had driven by her family and the village community after having addressed a secret gene with names .
the tradition also not mention their wives by name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer cur@@ ios@@ ities to fear , if any , they should not follow these practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health specialists and house@@ wives , belonging to a unique club and became the main spec@@ ulating theme of the city .
it is a place for them alone , where they discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ eness of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs , which there are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ bad@@ al , which is used by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and sets up for the dismant@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the coverage of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the ban of HI@@ VI and AIDS @-@ infected persons .
it tells about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made ambassador to the wall .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion round , was by women who call their hus@@ bands in their name .
she decided on this topic , because she wanted to open a talk about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can identify slightly .
to speak according to their hus@@ bands is a custom , which they all uph@@ eld and never question@@ ed .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition shows that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not keep this , is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as woman without moral .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round about it .
at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband so far on behalf , wanted to try home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
shell telling :
my mother in law and my husband weigh only long after the video was over .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned back to me , and said , I should call him of his name now .
with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini gained its first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to carry out discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving , and so on .
then they asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does it mean that they cannot respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was of the village of Wal@@ h in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries old tradition in which men had never left the names of their hus@@ bands .
shell telling :
a woman was so shy that she only k@@ ered during the whole exercise but a different decided to leave the whole fru@@ stration to him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on her faces was ec@@ st@@ atically .
I think I will never forget .
still in the ad@@ ren@@ al rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands in their name .
and they stopped their word .
over the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put into her head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner from the whole family .
she turned herself in her mother in her mother , she was afraid , saying that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do it . &quot;
a participant &apos;s husband was less under@@ stand@@ ably and the situation existed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc @-@ red spot on the forehead , indicating the sp@@ ouse status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the zinc @-@ red point if he would do it .
he just laughed and I stopped to carry him .
the other women did not complete with it , but mine , they are now in better position to choose itself , not to carry him on some days .
for many women a discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we have a trip at each discussion club .
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I do not want to worry that women don &apos;t worry who would hear what , &quot; she says .
during the last months in their lives they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cake ; they d@@ anced and talked about things about which they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have some things , for example like our ident@@ ities to our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest .
it feels great to tell some things , no matter how small it appears .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour , and how it is connected with clothes .
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most is that okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ war course , a wide shirt over a tro@@ users , wear ; they didn &apos;t dare to tie .
after much argument and discussion on the advantages of their own coat of clothes , the mor@@ als connected to the sar@@ is and much more , rough Roh@@ ini their own pair of course ( upper shirts ) in a discussion round , so that women could carry them .
next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a for which they can wear je@@ ans and the Roh@@ ini is sure they can be created .
in the question that in the five months had somewhat changed since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things come slowly into the roles :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but they listened to her husband &apos;s name .
some , enclosed , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now bear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
the women in a discussion club know that the changes they wish to achieve in their lives - like the fe@@ eders for more freedom of movement or its own coat of movement - at the end of a hard to navigate river .
as they give each other confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
each one of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am there too .
but this club is every one of us confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tell other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

many known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; told Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retailers Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of spar@@ king people for organ@@ traff@@ icking , presumably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , al@@ loc@@ ates the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government therefore called for a number of operations to live in order to stop practic@@ ality .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the County of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border with Malawi .
one of the victims was found and a part of the organs was found .
two men were arrested and subsequently enrolled that the bodies of sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
es may give the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a bald man of gold be@@ eps or riches , explained the police @-@ prec@@ e@@ finder of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks have been registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of these mur@@ ders for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 mission a mission conducted in the South African country to investig@@ ate this practice .
the persecution of men with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government strug@@ gles to fight this super@@ st@@ ition and judi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who pione@@ ers in the country :
attention to che@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the destination of water attacks , war@@ med the Muslim police after the latest assassin@@ ations of three spar@@ kl@@ ed men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were detained in the County of Mil@@ ange , where these mur@@ ders were arrested .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , a student and inhabitants of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already in the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ am@@ ans are involved in the death of bald men .
the persecution and killing of stap@@ le individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for probably super@@ st@@ itious ritu@@ als , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to which the victim might have power , the wealth of wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair loss issues were murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha informed the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s arms , Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty leading to Mozambique :

the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sident Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention to the international community of attention , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized due to liver can@@ cer@@ es in the end@@ setting .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) after being involved in the draft of the Charta 08 , a manifest@@ o that the democratic reforms had been involved in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China said Li@@ us case referred to as &quot; an internal matter . &quot; he told it as &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;

while some countries have critic@@ ised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully elabor@@ ated .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .

Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
but Singapore should be considered as a city according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister said that many people critic@@ ised the dom@@ ination of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries .
it supports Singapore to be regarded as a city .
... no one has question@@ ed whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people get an error .
I have tried to explain that we were different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to twist the logic of def@@ ending the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ ed to create this precious land , we hear that we don &apos;t have any country .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a fle@@ eing from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons given by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system from Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , he seemed un@@ democratic .
however , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , both cities which are led permanently from a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the subject again , the good old Lei@@ er appears from the author@@ itarian ruling leaders , the pret@@ ended logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the final week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am we gave answers to his American guests in the press , our Ju@@ di@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
appropriate questions he clo@@ aked with non @-@ answers economically .
Rachel Z@@ eng who ur@@ ges Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clear his mind as they did not understand this conclusion .
personally I think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , it is a city so that country belongs to our city ...
short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by rele@@ asing the comment on the blog , it refers to the reviews that you should begin to understand the entire coming of the conference , in order to understand the context of the testimony of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am better with which Singapore is a city and no country .
please read the script .
when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ even important even if we are looking forward to free and just elections .
he compared Singapore with cities in the U.S. ( and as many of these cities witnessed a party for decades ? ) .
when he said , Singapore is no country , &quot; he obviously not meant it in this sense !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who makes a leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice has said in Singapore , very pro@@ ver@@ ing ...
at least I did with Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w and the members of the old Gar@@ de what I expected - unless I agree with them or not , but that is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of Singapore &apos;s political leaders , I have doub@@ ts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is aware of what he is def@@ ending .
the TEM@@ AS@@ EK review st@@ alls the weak points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ram yoga monuments :
does Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; committed a mistake &quot; in a dev@@ out mistake or was it a fri@@ ghtened jection ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded as independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , what country do the so@@ vereign rights of the city go back to Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is both Country and City .
since he plays an important role within the framework of the Cab@@ inet , the testimony of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of great importance .
why do the Singap@@ urer make their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay back our prime minister ?
what is the value of our pink personal ID ?
are we citizens of a country or inhabitants of a city ?
, refer to the Journey of a Dec@@ ade for affir@@ mation of Singapore and was always a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this movement seems to have been much worse of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather talk about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;

global Vo@@ ices said recently to his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your homeland or homeland ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , covered with rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and a different fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is most asked me in Japan , is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , &quot; I am coming . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation occurs , it is regarded as polite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
following my clari@@ fication , then follow the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature &quot; . many can@@ cers may be cl@@ utter@@ ed if they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who does not know , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans distingu@@ ishes us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible in their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American however ... .
so it was even when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and on September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay marri@@ ages are legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is considered as the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate this .
first , I ad@@ mired many American friends who I ad@@ mired so much .
it would not make me anything if you would switch to the example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first , considered &quot; nice , &quot; says basically to be sp@@ ic@@ able - as the ben@@ ign@@ ant , gentle , but for@@ compl@@ ish figure of ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada would really be a nation of full people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no edges and edges , nothing where you can stum@@ ble .
harmless , means to be in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting , and to earn no attention .
this can be something good , if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that happen around one .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free , and alone , a main characteristic of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own business .
what out@@ si@@ ders are considered &quot; nice , &quot; perhaps just dar@@ ing polit@@ eness .
can@@ oes never talk about the fence across the fence .
the warm heart@@ y , open kindness , which I now connect to my American friends .
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au said the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada just sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a popular pop @-@ band was published in Thailand , that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ an who took power in 2014 and re@@ produce the power in spite of their promises , continue to re@@ ig@@ ate the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ ke Girl ) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules him make his girlfriend .
although not explicitly political , the music video also rel@@ ates in@@ directly to the ongoing military power of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video loaded on Facebook was divided by 1,@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; Der Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists stri@@ pped the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to Thai politics , as it is the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these photos of the video , which refer to some of the political topics , which Thailand has continued in the last three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ stic section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which makes the chief commander of the army absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ ori@@ ous program of &quot; Settings &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed as a critic .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear rules are often utilized by the authorities to ban activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army , which super@@ vised online content and tos@@ sed people who accused the monarchy .
Thailand puts a strict appeal against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ ority &quot; ( Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , Thailand was proclaimed the war of mar@@ tial law .
two days later it came to a coup .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continued to purchase is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts told they that purchasing is unnecessary and a waste of tax credits .
in the video even shown as people are thrown into a black van , before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another troub@@ les@@ hooting .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened to off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the Te@@ aser showed members of the band , which im@@ iti@@ oned the sal@@ ts from &quot; The Tri@@ bute von Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by p@@ utsch opponents during protests in 2014 .
life continues to go into the ruins of the ghost settlement in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article written by D@@ mit@@ ri St@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and will be published here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only re@@ covers very slowly in Eastern Be@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ian war officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the deserted villages of the northern suburbs in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al are showing striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
several ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , ab@@ as@@ ies , Geor@@ gier and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today most Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such sett@@ lements is also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war years there were more than 10,000 people here , but today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the population &apos;s total population tot@@ alled 16@@ ,000 people after barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a result of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks from the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ t@@ elec@@ k@@ ow@@ kas , are symbo@@ lically representing the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it becomes difficult to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens who served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ ooth@@ ed mag@@ nific@@ ence buildings .
people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union , meanwhile abandoned the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which is still one or two families host , one recogni@@ zes on the balconies , where the laundry is dry .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when you discover me with the camera in your hand , they immediately move back .
&quot; our Mother un@@ ites us that we let ourselves photograph , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers on her friend , and suddenly they leave the destroyed house and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the substan@@ cial sector ( cultivation of agricultural products for own space ) such as livestock hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable farming .
it &apos;s difficult to come across the rounds .
the District Administration delivers free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

about ten years ago an old woman drew up an old woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina would not want to accept financial support from her daughter and persist@@ ed for her young grand@@ kids instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she gives .
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells us that she and other village people try to meet regularly and celebrate holiday together .

&quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if you are holidays , we will visit us .
but we cannot do that constantly - everyone has with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ ot to her . &quot; they said we might build zu@@ cchini .
I have already prepared the ground .
I do not know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
K@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ asha has lived together with her husband and five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village above the war .

&quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or a few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this building were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right .
every day I remember how the city and war were once . &quot;
when our conversation ten@@ ds to the end , a little boy gives us over .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flying from the window and another boy hun@@ ts him .
he plays with the ball , which then rolled the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ ing the ball .
as they run , some of them throw stones on the ru@@ ined building .

in Mexico , &quot; M@@ um Africa &quot; hosts migrants in their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and will be published here with kind permission .
along the way of migrants attemp@@ ting to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places will be known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican girl , a small woman with a cor@@ ing pink d@@ olls and golden ear@@ rings in te@@ ddy bear .
she is named Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , many know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel has nothing of charm .
for about 2,50 Dollar the night will sleep in simple rooms , with ground floor , sli@@ pping walls and beds made of metal .
there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage in the anter@@ oom .
there is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an immigrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez sum@@ s up the people in full mini@@ buses and from the top part of the coast they begin to cry out : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you from Mama Africa ? &quot;
currently it is rather quiet but in this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some of them slept perfectly on boxes .
she wants to reject nobody .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick leave them medication they could not pay them mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m that drew you out of the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him if M@@ om Africa is a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ ghurt @-@ beard ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came to Brazil from Angola and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
she travels along with his sister , she hopes to go to Boston where to get her husband and her three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north .
the family had heard of other companion from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel the track together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weak@@ ened , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to purchase the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he is in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; m@@ um Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells you that their guests often send text messages when they continued to gr@@ ate them or to report her about the course of their trip .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spar@@ ks of hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken one of the immigrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the Bu@@ st@@ ick@@ ets can be sold to many African immigrants .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on floors on the ground , but at least they have electricity , washing machine and a kitchen outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells us . &quot; I have experienced what they experienced .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled to a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels from Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America and other residents are opening the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he bra@@ ided him with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to black@@ mail the money , without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single one , offered him roof .
a few months later , the family lives and is still trying to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back in full .
in the courses are travelers quiet their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy to be happy that her house is full , but she is also nost@@ al@@ gic because of which you left .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she pet@@ alled her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair bra@@ ins which made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and elderly .
she laughs , while she stops her for a short time .
&quot; Ya sis &quot; eron , &quot; they repeat every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are comp@@ elled to install a monitoring app on their cell phone .
a check @-@ Point for personal communications tools in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users to hand in the trial .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic min@@ orities in western China , is comp@@ elled to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell phone .
on July 10 , the cell phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi was given a mobile telephone not@@ if@@ ications in which the district government indicates a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
in this notice , it is said that the app will allow you to get access to terrorist information . &quot;
however , the app has even used to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women have been arrested in Aut@@ onom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because she , shortly after she had installed the app , had messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app would determine and follow the sources and distribution channels of terror@@ ists together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ e &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to carefully read users how much time they spend online , and to remot@@ ely control their own home network .
this app , using the min@@ ors for min@@ ors , should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could manip@@ ulate public actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manip@@ ulate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is consistent with other measures for the control of digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the bigger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote areas such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit in@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cen@@ sored and surveillance measures as well as regular internet circuits .
the media @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from &quot; China &quot; ( set @-@ in mind ) , the cen@@ sored news published in China , showed the users randomly checked the inhabitants at random if they had installed the supervision app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days .
if you &apos;re detected on a Check@@ point using one device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have comp@@ elled people to use devices who are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by mate technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; images from the China &quot; ( set @-@ in mind scre@@ ams ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which shows that the software can lift up a Windows operating system and get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are used to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party coun@@ cill@@ or to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and institutions , including universities and research institutions , are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computer and communication equipment .
a current report by Freedom House , a U.S. American Human Rights Organisation , also mentioned the new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a decree to all residents and entrepren@@ eurs , until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; to be registered at the local police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , Part 1 : all scre@@ ams to death
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the row &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane signs his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you feel that you are entirely alone in a place where all important is van@@ ished .
everything went after and after dis@@ b@@ anded , and a truth revealed that clearly recognis@@ able , both from inside and outside .
one that makes all honor her name .
one that has supp@@ ressed in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions that don &apos;t allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality goes back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the play , the beautiful scenes and the perform@@ ers - turn the characters into being made of flesh and blood , and all cri@@ es to death .
all doubt release in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the earth is turned on on the axis of the un@@ he@@ el . dir is clear that you are caught here between the walls , which have built your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone by stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to give &quot; my lesson &quot; as the head of safety services - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he ordered his power over us , as he even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five teenagers have been torn out during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to bring the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ aming .
all the districts have cov@@ eted , just my own .
for the first time it was quiet , rainy times , even if I didn &apos;t set high demands on a city that is up@@ lifting up into the arter@@ ies with government security and its ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply in the district ceased to function .
I broke through the silence by crying several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice upset by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to be together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends joined me , we al@@ lied to a gorgeous photo , full of my expectations and filled it all .
in such a moment , you are aware that you liberated the spirit from the lamp , but it simply is not interested in the least .
I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready , we meet our military security building . &quot;
he placed on .
then I got the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can return your voice after you have made it all the way to the office of security from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ assan was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I do now .
the colon@@ el of Gh@@ assan begins to talk : &quot; don &apos;t let me hear how you scre@@ am &quot; All@@ ahu &apos; , or you &apos;re only brave enough , if we are not nearby . &quot;
his hurt eyes were built on me .
&quot; and you are sad about what to look in my eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then did not do anything with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure when I answered , &quot; I didn &apos;t think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I have never ceased to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation , which could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said .
&quot; in sol@@ itary and his father hi@@ des him with it . &quot;
&quot; his Father same as that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this curse lies between me and the nose today .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture , which I was exposed for months months .
I &apos;m through the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again by the farm and into the second office which leads through a corridor to the single cells .
I had a look at all details before I cared for the room .
otherwise they probably agreed to a larger cell in this time .
I have to share with only one another prisoners with only one prisoner , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I grab@@ bed an old proven method of communication : with his f@@ ist on the wall .
I lear@@ nt that my H@@ ellen@@ ic was a &quot; sth@@ gathering . &quot;
after a long co@@ hes@@ ion he finally answered me .
apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a rep@@ utable man middle age who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect dark , there are no striking faces of me , and doctors are not giving it here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; perhaps someone whose voice sounds like mine sounds ? &quot;
all answers inter@@ connect his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me they would fre@@ t him when I stay .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to disp@@ el all these cro@@ ws that are lab@@ elled on the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
in the distance , I can still scre@@ am &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always around that time to hear the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that showed us the ror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; playing on 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to hear . &quot;
this revealed the secret : to protect and prevent state security in front of us , they talk in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they acted in al@@ a@@ wit@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their conden@@ sing al@@ pres@@ sions and locked the tight eye view of their world view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a country ; it is a curse to call co@@ exist@@ ence to transform the crime of their c@@ lans into a hero .
I super@@ vised the listening room and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I am acc@@ ust@@ omed to me , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and blo@@ ws after a friendly talk for me become a common communication tool .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me told me that I had to get used to it , to be punished , although I didn &apos;t do anything to make this sentence .
punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear my body as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this loving &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
there begins with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your d@@ unge@@ ons will delight in your scre@@ aming .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you can &apos;t hold your scre@@ ams .
my scre@@ ams did not play him enough , why they cast out the pipe through a cable .
with my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector , or if it belonged to normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us from their view@@ point , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour of change three of them changed , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any sense in my body - and my voice , which is why I ceased to cry out .
the head@@ s@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , which is why it was next to an electrically loaded bar .
electricity flow through my whole body , enough to store my whole quarter .
my semi @-@ cra@@ cked body , which lay stretched on the floor , was the perfect stream@@ lined body .
the num@@ b@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep back again ; let &apos;s say that this was my only option .
a few hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then call to the dawn .
the door opens and the light opens the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
I answer with the voice of an exhau@@ st@@ ive yo@@ ung@@ sters : &quot; my Lord , my father needs to be terrible . &quot;
&quot; be peace and walk you , you will go . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released .
where do they guide me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends the most of its time inside ; once again he sli@@ ps to his canvas , once again his computer , and again also to his couch .
but what one can rely on is a cig@@ ar between his fingers or his mouth with nic@@ otine stain@@ ed lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year where Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ ev@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( approximately : farmer ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who has been transferred to the conservative majority against gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which deals often with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian civil servants , he also ur@@ ges out the core of the whole Arab world . all these issues cannot be found in his home town of Amman , but also in cities which from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa within Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking by borders , and he can feel according to his own statement with people who have suffering from the devast@@ ating effects of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he does not open it openly , he gives a special dis@@ like against the US @-@ American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war zones whose identity as &quot; Palestinian escap@@ es of the second generation - so called himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own living conditions , &quot; emphas@@ izes H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I &apos;m a human being , while in the water dissolved Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . during this time it is en@@ vis@@ aged for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the j@@ ord@@ an law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal in Ram@@ adan .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
generally speaking the lo@@ f@@ eit of coffee and the sn@@ aps of K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose are primarily free of freedom .
sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky above all , when looking at a glance into the neighboring countries .
therefore , it simply avo@@ ids basic things to do - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan water - to not land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancel@@ ed a gig of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila , already for the second time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
minor and former spokesperson for the press in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert &quot; has just been cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singer .
many say also , the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is the most dangerous ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila cap@@ tiv@@ ates the j@@ ord@@ an people as a &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; which continues to stand &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be easy to dis@@ repair rh@@ etor@@ ic , but actually a clear cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b destroyed traditional generations of gender equality by killing his vision of the fate of Arab women to have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the image shows a skel@@ eton of a obviously re@@ bo@@ asted unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch down to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives by the hands of them they actually have to trust .
in Jordan , Jordan has risen the number of &apos; hon@@ ours &apos; from the un@@ official out@@ ward in Jordan .
human Rights Watch listed their climax in 2016 . however , the number of hon@@ ours reached its zen@@ ith in 2016 . however , the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women who tried to attempted murder , or domestic violence to an appropriate way .
according to a law against crime in 1954 , women who are subjected to the danger of in@@ family violence , &quot; in in@@ definite period of time , &quot; and for her release is often a year@@ long bureau@@ cratic effort and the guarantee provided by the family , that the woman will not happen .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music also enjoys great popularity and is well known to shr@@ ink not from topics that are t@@ abo@@ o in his country for a long time .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but he dre@@ amt of having his music , which is full of explic@@ it incen@@ tives on sexu@@ ality , freedom , and freedom of expression is not split by politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
to me , politics became inst@@ aller , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos; , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
in turn , &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs which are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse repeatedly follows :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is there . &quot;
in the course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get in his words &quot; that can be &quot; - whether there is faith or failure , H@@ et@@ ero@@ e or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that hard someone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on gender equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals has been deeply cen@@ sored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ age Ro@@ ya in order to remember that his comments were ri@@ pped in the context , and in his opinion were cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a re@@ worked version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ac@@ qui@@ res the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that in@@ tolerance to homosexu@@ als did not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ bian , a poet of the eighth century who still remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ bian could work later on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , in the eighth century could be openly described above homosexu@@ ality , why can Jordan not do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila , or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ ish realm , there is nothing new that the government ur@@ ges attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive votes were brought into silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian press government took several former government officials and members of the teaching , with the reas@@ oning , they had repor@@ tedly critic@@ ised the problems with the problems of corruption in the country in social media .
in view of this , the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs concert is according to only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to provo@@ ke a structural change in the next generation of Jordan .
for him , progress is a permanent key and taking . Jordan , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila is now fighting for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so there is H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions .
he is not only dre@@ aming about his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of taking them . &quot;
perhaps the region is called up with music , art and literature of a real and basic open@@ ness - and not by bombs , stre@@ amed part@@ itions and on artificial manner of guided demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes it .
until it is so far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and thus also resist .

Neb@@ uta to A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ men are as fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one susp@@ ects that there is a variation of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually done in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory of which the drums , the drums and the dance of more than one thousand years have been invaded the northeast , in order to conquer the indigenous people of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to pick up a few great seats , so we have a super view .
you can imagine only how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ an Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition of W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro As@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true and this way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against s@@ lan@@ der and shaving knives

rare , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this history , as they help to keep the Peruvian youth from crime , and a legitim@@ ate job as to promote the war@@ der .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where road crash@@ es and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 was that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance , and therefore also the fallen hair@@ style of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Chile ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Chile ) , has led to more and more normal hands in the experienced hands of hair@@ styles that can form these elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles .
the un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme bo@@ unds of fantasy and creativity , has even an annual event inspired by the competition of hair@@ dressing &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there , experts oppos@@ e each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( further videos to current competitions this can be found on the public Facebook profile of Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to change their weapons against hair tools and instead of bad advice would have a training in hair@@ style that enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the numerous ways , dozens of young people saw that they can sei@@ ze a profession that is currently in fashion .
before the school year , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district of which we are very proud of , because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : letter of letters to gu@@ err@@ illa

the following article is the revised version of the contribution &quot; Liebes@@ messages to Guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ ians , &quot; published by the International Online Magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who feel cast out and creating aff@@ ection ?
this was exactly the question that the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young @-@ Youth Foundation are no longer inspired by the head and inspired her to write letters by the Young People &apos;s Cart@@ as p@@ or la RE@@ Y@@ our@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to recon@@ ciliation ) , the young people encouraged letters to write letters .
recently , their land was the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces Kolum@@ bi@@ ens ) which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered as the result of peace agreement as so important that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its mer@@ its .
in front of Columbus , however , there is still a long way until one can speak of a real recon@@ ciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ary people who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to a rh@@ etor@@ ic , and in around the clock , they have to integrate their weapons into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which has acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in continuous fear and in some cases of deep hat@@ red against gu@@ err@@ illa com@@ ers , has now begun to hold them in their ranks and support them when designing a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had joined together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the campaign &apos;s goal is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa - which will then be personally handed over .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the Camp@@ a@@ ign
the idea for the recon@@ ciliation was presented at the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize in Bog@@ ot@@ á , which was held in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those forget that they need much more needed .
he plane , told it to share his love with people that needed the most urgent attendance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 2000 letters were collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to a UN storage in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ ok@@ re@@ ists to the camp to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves how they had used to meet the instructions of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable , how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after we handed over the letters , a former soldier led me to the gu@@ er@@ illa war camp .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bus@@ ch &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the gu@@ er@@ illa had living ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because beside him there was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
and I asked him , saying , &quot; H@@ ello , what do they just do ? &quot; he said , &quot; I answer a letter which someone wrote to me . &quot;
it &apos;s a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone has written me something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; there suddenly tears over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the head@@ lamps .
perhaps he was sorry , because he was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion to this fighting , and would help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I only learned how I have to deal with weapons .
but now there is peace , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
as a pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some c@@ ord@@ ings of the F@@ ARC were gathered for a discussion round .
the students were all grew up as already war and the F@@ ARC already existed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for one goal of this mag@@ n@@ itude it is worth coming to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reality in which the country lives , does me sore .
but it comfort me that all men - even those who have killed , and so much damage to us , give us something and a smile and a hug you can give .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca , wrote in the example of Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ians was prophes@@ ied that after the dis@@ arm@@ ament peace would reign .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are willing to lift up and stand up for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we from the F@@ ARC now set at peace , on a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a land in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from my own experience that nothing is easy . those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence will be a lot of difficulty coming .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a trans@@ woman speaks about the persecution in Che@@ chn@@ ya and the life of Kad@@ y@@ rov

it follows the translation of an article that was written by impro@@ per partner A@@ ida Mir@@ k@@ h@@ ova and his first release on the OC Media website .
hom@@ osex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with hor@@ rors , activists over the last few months have experienced the persecution of E@@ uler &apos;s persecution in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends on a dam@@ nation &apos;s stop on the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not yet created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who have shared some of their experiences with us and spoken about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports were published , which cover the towing , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , who captured a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen Auth@@ orities , susp@@ ect the suspic@@ ious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt she felt her childhood , she was a woman in reality .
when they grew up , it became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a certain place for them , which was why she moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Che@@ chens from the Gender Equality family , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
she moved from fear to her life in the US .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day , I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who put in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while trying to help her , somebody , of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents , and spread it all over the Internet , with the following message : &quot; so there are no males in Che@@ chn@@ ya that can remove these shame ? &quot;
then the photos of my documents by the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the Round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was doing it , a few grocery bags came from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and a@@ woke up last end in the hospital .
apparently some women had to get everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
I learned in the hospital that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
OC Media : in which cases were you placed - in whom the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name ; but the doctor left and laid me for the women .
for that I am very grateful .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim name , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respec@@ tful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got a threats .
they called me , wrote me - Rel@@ ated , strange , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Che@@ chn@@ ya , to prove that it was a lie .
they asked absurd Dem@@ ands : some said me , I have to prove it by up the roads ; others wanted me to rise up in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was only bad , and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people once said my mother on the road .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which has not just damaged your family but the whole republic .
we cannot touch you , because you are a religious woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
in my mother it became too much and she placed a cord around his neck .
fortunately , the neigh@@ bors arrived and saved them .
at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and just a few hours later , under the window was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it had happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checking the license plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
I left the country with their help , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my m@@ um when I arrived .
I bought it without registration , without notice , without notice .
I broke my old SIM card and she threw it in the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered for a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe about you would be safe , but because you have left the country ?
our people know already in which hotel you are set . they even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , this is a table theme .
I still have some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements in me .
also I wish to overcome this spiritual barrier , I cannot overcome these spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother &apos;s in life , I will do my best to do not harm you .
when we ch@@ atting with camera I actually give myself trouble as to see how the person re@@ members them out of their past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for whom I needed more information on the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I talked to somebody who served one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that while Ram@@ adan was arrested , he was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
so , I think they probably re@@ charge the relative , they take care of the problem with the affected person and end of demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; glory &quot; has experienced by blood .
OC Media : are gay men even now detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there is not a lot .
if , above all those who have no weal@@ thy relative , or that were left by their relatives to question Gaddafi &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are kept there to be presenting them later as terror@@ ists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked some village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not just van@@ ished , but purpos@@ efully di@@ pped to radic@@ alize himself .
OC Media : is this now only a guess or have you a source of this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown your beard .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was even when they were taken along .
up to now they were not introduced as band@@ its , and there were no reports to date . however , we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible .
why wouldn &apos;t we have allowed this man to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think it was already known in 2003 when I was still living in Gros@@ ny - and I never had any problems there .
in ear@@ nest !
from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
the fact that Russia originally wanted to manage the fasc@@ ination , but ultimately takes us back into the stone period .
OC Media : how is that possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyebrows were ad@@ pped ; I had color@@ ized lashes , bore bore and short tops .
the security department of the sh@@ aria has never bent me just one hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met with me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never ins@@ ulted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Save not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children , if they make fun of sick .
OC Media : so , they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed they were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never ins@@ ulted , never ch@@ ased , never beaten me .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace be fulfilled ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov appeared to the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk on TV via Mor@@ al .
he did not talk about us by se , but primarily through women &apos;s behavior .
still - you could feel how people started to change in town .
he who was th@@ wart@@ ed and laughed at once , suddenly watching herself with suspic@@ ion .
during the time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly wor@@ sen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I &apos;m still active as an activ@@ ist .
at present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize tea ffs , gath@@ er@@ ings , I don@@ ate them to the hospital and help them to get food types .
I don &apos;t have a cent for this .
I discovered these people myself when I dra@@ gged refuge .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you have an Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is al@@ ic@@ kers .
so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
it is exactly the same as Che@@ chens , who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no fl@@ ailing in them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans , which have the Cab@@ ins , have the Russians and the Russians . on the whole planet it is - but &quot; not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I am from there , so it is un@@ pleasant to hear .
I meet here as many men out of the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go to the mosque and during Ram@@ adan , live together with men .
do you know , many think of tran@@ si@@ veness to men , the men love , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ er .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact , different habit@@ ats .
it is the most important thing for me to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I am so personal myself , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than one year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am myself .
local groups war@@ n an increase of suicide bom@@ bers within the poverty @-@ pac@@ ed Arab d@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian civil population suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the past few months there is a strong increase of self @-@ moral .
the photo of the Arab Workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self burning process of a man called Jas@@ si@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August retro@@ arded the des@@ perate situation of the Arab world Nazi community of Iran , marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra , the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he cho@@ oses for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to bring the in@@ ability to his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi calls for human rights to remain anonymous and anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube was able to ign@@ ite the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly creating the flames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the village of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the village of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August inside the Arabian Mo@@ re@@ azi minority , and activists from the spot would war@@ n that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Man@@ i@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ yt@@ Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have been imposed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt because of the persecution by the Iranian government , trusted and unable to keep their families and follow a safe job .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is a major part of the Arab an@@ azi community living in Iran , has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to deny its living .
before a century , the Arab world was an autonomous region of Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and in 1925 he took great effort to finish the ethnic autonomy in all Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , some of the largest in Iran are present in oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most recognised and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continued to develop only slowly , and the native population only gets less from this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated disease , hunger and dischar@@ ges .
the Iranian regime uses systematic jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of Arab areas in the Persian fields , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are to be moved .
these dam@@ s have led only to destroy the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destro@@ ying local farming as well as the local farming and palm industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ Hawai@@ zi youth has now risen to 81 % .

a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aim to destroy the mind of national resistance . &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , reported that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , leads to a &quot; high increase , &quot; the number of self @-@ moral among the young ancestors .
Du@@ Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has gotten worse , this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the integration process :
since officials and institutions are not preferred by Arab labour , the local Arab A@@ hi@@ ft will have access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regim@@ es , to destroy the spirit of national resistance to young Arabs and to force her living outside of their home ancestors .
there are people who had to change their origin and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the An@@ c@@ azi who are not toler@@ ated as even Arabic name in the workplace will not be toler@@ ated , for speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing of arab@@ ic clothing .
given the given circumstances , which the Arab gene@@ alog@@ y had to end@@ ure , human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking knowledge .

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide back and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions expressed .
they can be read in the comments under the original text .
if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who pret@@ end themselves as inter@@ sec@@ ular femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
you wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even lay out well thought scientific and social arguments from me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally see all femin@@ ist * .
for example , women today still earn less money despite the same education as men .
that women are still under strict observ@@ ations when it comes about what they are allowed to do with her body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of this and I wear double and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I &apos;m a black woman .
and yet : if I speak on skin color , on black C@@ is women , to black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a women or to black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention , in which kind of being physically , mental and verb@@ al , many white femin@@ ists leave to be silent .
however , they are all agree that women - all women - come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , &apos; my lord &apos; to sing &apos; in order to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about it in addition to sexu@@ alised violence a realized form of ra@@ ci@@ ally motivated violence that we are subjected to black women on two different ways .
or about that black women and women of other fields of origin do less than white men and women .
the black girl and girls with an immig@@ rant background often referred to the school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women are exposed in black spher@@ es and women with an immig@@ rant background with higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership to suffer as white women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am exhausted , and will no longer fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented spell that has opposed me and countless other black women and always turned back .
in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in their speech : &quot; I am not a wife ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is an horri@@ fied and mar@@ gin@@ alized being .
I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and ways to advance their eg@@ o@@ centric programme .
I will not try to settle some white women the importance of the over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and gender . because some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honour a better .
although the inter@@ c@@ tion@@ ist femin@@ ism was founded to give a home to women different origin and dis@@ narrow from white femin@@ ism , femin@@ ism is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism . &quot;
I draw it before , and dis@@ connect myself to the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was brought to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ c@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women according to our own ideas and give ourselves to the spher@@ es that we are created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ ism : rec@@ laim@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves in this way as we can defend ourselves in this way and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped .
although some white and inter@@ c@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ists will immediately call Separ@@ at@@ ism and Exclu@@ sion when they read these lines , please inform you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contra@@ dictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as part of this para@@ dig@@ m due to my dark skin and because of my being .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a environment in which my life is neither ignored , nor ignored , nor turned down .
p@@ addle against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations

in this documentary from Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct so@@ vereign debt crisis in Iraq .

Paraguay : women and her harder fight against violence
a group of women represents &quot; The weeping women &quot; is to bring her pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ ality in the land and in the region to express their re@@ jection .

the following article is the shortened and re@@ worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # We@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ ood ) which about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the persons affected .
a police station , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , said that she could not have been working against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who would have been violent against him .
since the end of their relationship there was a little time passed and the police said , her testimony would not be put into the files , but you can &apos;t do any more .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena was showing because of mist@@ re@@ ments , the advert@@ ised display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was nothing .
a few days later the second woman drew its display back .
breaking the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women are going to display , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of women ad@@ mit to be victims of violence , to be victims of violence at all .
In@@ cub@@ 1 impacts and statistical analysis 2 Un@@ seen ab@@ uses and a legal system that has nothing inferior to Paraguay laws : good base , faulty implementation stro@@ kes and stat@@ s
it is hard to find how many women are truly har@@ assed in the Centro de Document@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studio , a soci@@ etal research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports , but they do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General went up 9@@ 600 advertis@@ ements due to domestic violence . at 70 % it went by violence against women .
86 % of ads in the police came by women .
there were over 5000 advertis@@ ements because of domestic violence in the peace stories . here also 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics however do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an female Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only few of these off@@ ences are actually indicated . &quot; on every woman who is published in Paraguay for psychological abuse , come 9 women who do not .
for every woman who is cancelled because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; declared the end of 2014 .
since the mur@@ ders of Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ender , the prosecution en@@ forcement agencies have not been appropri@@ ately documented , as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists attended at least 12 cases of mur@@ ders in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , Paraguay runs every ten days a woman because of violence by men .

invisible mis@@ deeds and an legal system that doesn &apos;t under@@ takes anything
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z has been the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he in@@ sist@@ ed that she called it the name of all its former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but she was still looking for .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and has not been together with Carlos . but for two years she bore mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe :
I never thought that I would once be victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I thought that only women happens to be dig@@ ni@@ fied because they dec@@ eive of violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mariana uses social media to report about the mist@@ ral of Carlos Vera .
calling name , she wrote contributions on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and several attacks during their two year relationship , and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos even . he asked the rh@@ etor@@ ic , whether he had ever raised his hand against it and refused to ad@@ mit that his behaviour also was a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mariana , why they had enjoyed the so long time Carlos and did not leave it earlier .
it almost seemed as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least had a certain comp@@ licity .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay has fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partners were in@@ treated .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that is of women all in some way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimony of women seriously .
in Victor@@ ias &apos;s case everything started with psychological abuse .
her weal@@ thy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s read@@ ings in the authorities remained without a result and also from her relatives , she didn &apos;t get support .
it led a trial against its former partner who developed into an imper@@ for@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country where it mainly went about money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay : good approach , faulty implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but not used .
the display of mist@@ re@@ acts is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ aur@@ i , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , provides great problems with the use of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a bill of law was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # Für@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and Movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Ein@@ e@@ Provi@@ de ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law sees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d an independent off@@ ender and pun@@ ish it , as already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the law@@ suit was changed in a few points , in order to also capture the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law that is denied the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions that are currently prohibited in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill has planned to carry out much of the ( bureau@@ cratic and economic ) process costs which must pay the victims of violence even if they just want to report and receive a safe accommodation in the state .
Ech@@ aur@@ i argu@@ ed that the law may not be effective if the legisl@@ ature has no sufficient financial means at your disposal :
in Paraguay , mist@@ re@@ age is seen as part of inter@@ human relationships .
here a change must be held , so violence is no longer considered to be a bit Normal .
whoever is silent in the face of these facts turns his guilty , bearing the perpet@@ rators t@@ apping the perpet@@ rators .
we must report so long , until failure does not apply any more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law have been changed , but amongst others , a passage was cancelled , which prov@@ oked the partners in cases of domestic violence to recon@@ ciliation .
the opinions about the changes are turning apart .
the section relating to recon@@ ciliation was seen as the opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , its victims again attack .
the match of the words &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman have continued attacks on Oman a year according to a newspaper .
&quot; this site was closed due to a decision by the Information Minister . &quot; read on the website of the banned journal Az@@ am@@ n .
more than one year ago the American authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage through corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he served a year @-@ old prison sentence .
two other editors from Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , and zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and charged in court but later released .
in 1970 , Oman is governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , having set a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Minister of Defense , Minister of Defence , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council and the President of the Central Bank .
the dominion of sult@@ ans is marked by the persist@@ ence of security forces , especially the domestic bl@@ iss@@ ance , including press freedom , inclusion and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists .
the authorities stop peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights , including activists , also to express their views on public affairs of the country like corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closure and the arrest of three of their editors in the last year , is a hard blow for freedom of press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) since its foundation in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , was confirmed , after in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , an article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties to bind hands on the judi@@ ci@@ ary , and the intervention of senior officers in judi@@ cial decisions .
in the report government officials were accused of having placed Justice of the Supreme Court in Oman , a verdict in a law@@ suit .

on 3 August 2016 , zah@@ n Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , Member of the Board of Directors , was charged by the ISS before the special department and arrested by security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS had taken the vice @-@ chief editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had served as Chief Editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
the paper was concluded in in@@ definite period , after the Information Security issued the order that &quot; the publication and dis@@ semin@@ ation of the newspaper had been banned from any way , including online , from 9th August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in Mas@@ cat &apos;s trial in the trial against Al Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the Tribunal sentenced three journalists to prison and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ jo@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted of a distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot;
moreover al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the injury to an audience and the s@@ lan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic R@@ ial ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) , in addition to one @-@ year vocational ban imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year of prison and a fine of 1000 R@@ ial ( 2600 US dollars ) after it was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for spreading the material , which could be found guilty for public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a deposit was set in the amount of 5000 star R@@ ial ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the sentence .
the Appeals Chamber pronounced al @-@ Ab@@ ri in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari in prison for six months .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 in the absence of his six @-@ month prison sentence in Mas@@ cat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remained in prison , where he served his one @-@ year sentence .
the Court of Appeal uph@@ eld the decision of the Ministry of Information to conclude the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of the court to leave Az@@ am@@ n , the paper continues to look after attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement showing the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the Minister presented himself another time against the decision of the Appeals Court to publish the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only ones in which Oman has been viol@@ ating the freedom of freedom in Oman .
for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ cre@@ atine and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , include , for example .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not willing to end a comprehensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j will@@ ingly and liber@@ ate un@@ conditional release ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to be able to re@@ tire its journalists in their work ;
3. the freedom of press in the land to protect and
4 . under all circumstances , Human Rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have hin@@ dered their lawful rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judi@@ cial c@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ state organisation , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and its right to gather together peace@@ fully and provides protection for them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration taken with the agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media , making it a growing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need of medical research there are two reasons : for lack of global health care , many medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa are far more serious than elsewhere , and lack of investment for exploring these diseases caused by the pharmaceutical industry .
second , research which is carried out by African scientists itself is helping to build its own research capacity in Africa . greater role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Centre for Research of Inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous Disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia where AIDS epidemic was the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Louisiana , and in Indiana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he was involved in the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the most beneficial health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. Wa@@ er speaks as private owner ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the use of research results . I assist the sam@@ b@@ ish national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I can even start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion of important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always keep the receiver , instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions that we get are often not suitable in our area , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does funding and support occur ?
is it adequate ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are encouraged differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or here , because the financing and development chances are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research project you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not conform to the standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water , and internet .
laboratory equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students from all ages .
there is a need for special academic education , beginning at any age .

from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has already been bred to the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant that has been grown and consum@@ es by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space .
in almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was granted only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and question , as many Sal@@ at@@ ars can get borders .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noted that more salads were always patented and that he could not continue to bre@@ eders for them .
the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or green leaves .
in recent years more and more such patents have been applied on more plants such as grain or ant@@ it@@ ers . due to these trends , plant bre@@ eders , environmental prot@@ ector and experts help ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on still bred Sal@@ ad , he &apos;s needed some time since his work is increasingly difficult because of its work .
&quot; it is like a b@@ oul@@ ders would lie in a river around which I have to cycle .
so we must do that now , but it is a split with the growing tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that patents will go far too far .
and if they are standing before a court , nobody can breed a new Sal@@ at@@ sor@@ te because all features are already patented . &quot; it is as good as possible and tries to breed the features that he wants .
however , it is very c@@ auti@@ ous and stri@@ ves to use no material , which is protected as a spiritual property .
it has also been connected to a movement which is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ eders ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS have bred and eaten red tube sal@@ ts in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; at the station . there it is tested if plants can be grown into space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name so@@ unded rather than it would come from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , providing alternative sources to the protected software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and are so suitable for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , U.S. bre@@ eders could also commit themselves to freely use seed free of seed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
dark prospects
for emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Os@@ si @-@ Board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg have control over the seed and the possibility to grow new plants , important for food security and environmental protection .
seed also plays a role in larger relations such as biodi@@ versity , rights of peas@@ ants , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by destro@@ ying seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not deal with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from organic agriculture or Mon@@ san@@ to and Mon@@ san@@ to or Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer in August 2016 should also know that the way for example is being offered on farmers markets , such as such vegetables are threatened .
nutritional so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty without seed so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative committed themselves to keep other seed alive free of charge . therefore , its approach in contrast , seeds and plant features are patented .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Os@@ si , employed himself in her PhD thesis with gen@@ et@@ etic variation in carrots and their availability . she found out that around one @-@ third of all the car@@ rot features are protected as a intellectual property , making it either non@@ use@@ able for plant bre@@ eders .
for other plants there are still no estimates , but experts such as Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that massive crops such as wheat are patented as wheat or carrots .
a question of sight
plants are so cultivated that they produce specifically undes@@ irable features - from such , through which their taste or their color improves up to such , because they can flour@@ ish in certain environments , such as p@@ ests or diseases .
patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders take more and more patents present . currently , because of climate change , the changing conditions are much worse than ever before , because the changing conditions are much worse than ever .
in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to Spe@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowledge that genetic vari@@ ability is generally important and also important for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four con@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company re@@ alizes the preservation of genetic diversity .
she does , however , contra@@ dic@@ ts the mind that to promote intellectual property other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant types of plant will promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
often , these instructions help others to come with another method at the same result .
so such protection does not in@@ hib@@ its innovations but encour@@ ages them to provide more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees that different : 20 years of waiting , until a patent protected , encour@@ agement certainly not provide innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to grow on plants , that are adapted to the revised environmental conditions , the struggle would have already been lost .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources should have been a general well and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent Plant Bre@@ eders &quot; have neither time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive to us .
we want to make farmers easier .
this is what drives us out , and it will be impossible for us if we are not able to use the best and most genetic resources . &quot;
overall , Mort@@ on sounds in the concept of pat@@ rons , plant features are patented : &quot; we don &apos;t really create features .
the plants build them up themselves and as a bre@@ eder we have no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of cultiv@@ ators : &quot; one who has grown a sor@@ bate has also bred its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , which produce grown her@@ bic@@ ide are cultivated and cultivated in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is very gene@@ alog@@ y . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( those that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , also without den@@ ying it or they keep it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both are the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eders Frank Mort@@ on looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

Mort@@ on &apos;s opinion is that bre@@ eders would be innovative by the avoid@@ ance of plant pat@@ ent@@ atives : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that are patented .
I need constantly new material to my catalog , since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , it is 20 years prior to competition , how to make it quite simply in my opinion . &quot;
although the United States seem to be leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources , develops a &quot; open source &quot; seed program and helps them to grow new varieties , which meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to go to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German Organization Agre@@ e is working on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for the bre@@ eders differ from country to country so because of the Os@@ si obligation not simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that the conventional cultivated plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks for the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conventional plants .
however , there is no law yet ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to put this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , at the farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa , to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the pattern of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , &quot; that the organization currently has a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , that will be the next year of official starting signal .
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international Non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seeds and biodi@@ versity worldwide in order to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a union of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others have to make a report to promote and improve the seed politics to ensure a stable supply of food .
in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphas@@ ised - a link , by the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si tries to see him soon more people .
&quot; the movement of regional and ecological foods is particularly considering how and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly any role played , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to realise the human being that there is more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
even the Egyptian authorities unlock the content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a Human Rights Organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ est column .
on the weekend at the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government filed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt , and the Arab world .
in August the network released a statement on Facebook where it was sharp@@ ly critic@@ ized by the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked no more than two months of 21 pages , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic language edition of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; supporting terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , colum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights Research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt &apos;s blog .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that it is not available for web sites and media in Egypt .
now the blog , which he directed to b@@ ypass the C@@ en@@ sur@@ ge of the Egyptian government , was the aim of a attack .
blo@@ gger , the supplier where also located in Zi@@ adas &apos;s blog , on the other hand , is open .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he reported by Egyptian security forces while he reported about the student protests and carried a video on how the police executed physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly turn around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada re@@ vo@@ iced to the locking by the government and refle@@ cting what this means to him :
those who make blogs are very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the freeze of blogs are not important for the world , it is nevertheless for me for two reasons :
1 ) It is a success being able to give myself the feeling of an siege to an arrest ; an arrest , an attempted murder , ob@@ tru@@ ce at the National Security Council , called blocking blogs , and any other web site which I worked .
2 ) You proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only one small audience .
I wish to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the c@@ ens@@ orship .
now , after they have locked him and that they have fear of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ ageous go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities det@@ ectable up Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this includes technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of vend@@ ors , through the allocation of internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began , began .
such a practice indicates the intention of the Government to block and fil@@ tering the Egyptian users .
in addition , the situation will be wor@@ sen@@ ed that the cen@@ sored decisions will be taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed against trial against those acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to search for and whom will it next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the people argue .

in the middle of the economic crisis and a significant financial situation in 2017 , the force of the force at Rio came to the highest level since 10 years .

for the detailed reporting about violence in the Rio @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the article entitled &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which they failed to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper in this way :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual ver@@ ts , etc . everything that only happens in Rio will be published in the &quot; war in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to say : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so we do not exclu@@ de our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video , which was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor in Chief of the newspaper , that this decision was not a reason for pride , rather a sign of failure :
extra , it is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a ruin in a country that does not recognize the war .
in the same video explains a journalist of the newspaper that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , which are subjected to criminal organisations .

but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; be used more than they ?
in an article on the News Portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed that violence as a &quot; war &quot; have argu@@ ed . this in their opinion is a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to assume responsibility in the police for ac@@ count@@ ability .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio yourself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance and a historical and self @-@ negle@@ ct of public service .

Rio de Janeiro is to be called &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , according to statistics from 2015 , according to statistics from 2015 in north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we take a look at the M@@ ord@@ rates pro state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; she writes .
extra , the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , emphas@@ izes the policy of the State &apos;s security policy for many years .
the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Pac@@ if@@ ic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the state governments of the state of Rio in 2003 , was to capture a fav@@ ela by use of a massive police offering and permanently use a unit permanently .
at first this was led to a decrease of violent deaths . in a few years the U@@ PP was opposed to several reports of vulner@@ ability and re@@ pres@@ sions against poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux said one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not comply with the &quot; civil war &quot; criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio explo@@ des as a serious consequences for the human being .
for this requires the state to place funds and ways of being typical of a war . this is the in@@ tru@@ sion into the territory of an &quot; enemy , &quot; with which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and to object for &quot; coll@@ ating damage &quot; and &quot; mut@@ ated bul@@ lets . &quot;
war or later , fact is that residents of fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week is now that the police found the hill with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho fav@@ ela , in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all these violence he made head@@ lines : an orch@@ ard died because of shots , which the police had fired up from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besie@@ ged Syrian mart@@ yrs to plant mushrooms
screenshot of the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from the brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime to loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Instit@@ utes , are located in Damascus and in reverse , H@@ oms , D@@ eir Y@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently , about one million Syrians in a state of siege .
East Gh@@ out@@ a region is especially strongly affected , where an attack on chemical weapons called for hundreds of civilians by chemical weapons in August 21 , 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of Assad was committed .
since 2013 , this number of rebels controlled areas outside Damascus had been under siege under siege under siege , making them soci@@ ated on loc@@ alized or through tun@@ nels and control points .
by years of block@@ ade traditional food like meat was in@@ accessible for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ den@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i are not included among the traditional foods which are planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it is an attractive dietary source of many residents of the besie@@ ged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the main objective of this project , com@@ p Nabil , said to the French message agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we opted for the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Le@@ ila , one of the organiz@@ ers , reported that for three years he had been fighting this project and sque@@ e@@ zed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; gaining an awareness . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , use the &apos; Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ den@@ da NGO &apos;s humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to provide 125 families knowledge of plant@@ ing pilgrims , so Dr. Le@@ ila is to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this writing , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approx . 12.@@ 700 million , but will continue to collect donations from Can@@ Do on Monday , 04 . September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators , which hold the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
locally manufactured agents are used locally for fuel , in order to supply the generators with necessary energy .
Dr. Le@@ ila said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production of mig@@ rating fung@@ al seeds , &quot; before they checked their quality and , whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when this was accomplished they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in the East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Le@@ ila declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ al from different reasons , &quot; : breaking the siege .
supplying a new source of food on the market .
spread a culture of self catering due to food resi@@ due ( such as paper , tea , coffee pot , cardboard , etc ) will be used to gain new foods .
creation of new work@@ places , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new work@@ places for people with disabilities that are bound to their home .
he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot;

Portuguese calls for justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people were protest@@ ing in many District Apostles of Portugal on October 21 , seeking justice for the victims of fires that occur during the week before the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state institution .
also fires were registered in the Gal@@ ic@@ ia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there have been more than 500 fire @-@ bur@@ sts , spread in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest area by satellite TV in 2017 , about 500,000 hectares of forest were burnt - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the serious situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
throughout Portugal , in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - N@@ ata ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017
some of Twitter users shared images :

the sin@@ ew@@ y tragedy
the aim of the protest of Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ventive and fighting measures by the State .
the people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al proclaimed the League of farmers in Portugal in the newspaper p@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão there were streets and villages for everything and nothing evacu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did nowhere : there are dozens of open streets , surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy would happen again as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits will be question@@ ed with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
a profound proposal on the forest form , which the government had submitted to severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was ob@@ jected by the commun@@ es who saw the new rules as obst@@ acle to investments .
&quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity of case , when the applicant had means of self @-@ guards - that was an open back@@ door so that all could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continued in the same article on the p@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper .
the environment @-@ organisation Quer@@ cus has pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly flamm@@ able wood , are still spreading everywhere in a v@@ icious circle , according to the fires of this type .
this event also adds to these problems that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as habit@@ ants sought or tried to contact us , offline .
it was a private initiative , provided the people with information : they use their own civil protection data using the application of f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was founded in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade , so that the servers pursued the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users , who pursued the fires , did not last more than half a million .
even the founder asked for help :

the trail of Refu@@ gee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eurs

in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conqu@@ est of Afghanistan began as a result of the Taliban .
two years ago a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group@@ ings which had defeated the short @-@ lasting pro @-@ Soviet government , so Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
although his mother never said it then , she knew that she couldn &apos;t see her son very long ago - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was supposed to break up .
his uncle would pick it up and bring him to the tugs .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party , was just murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt shel@@ tered .
the Taliban fighters known for their hat@@ red came near@@ er .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ hes@@ ion pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took care of what was left of his low pay , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and s@@ led bags with mort@@ ar that were heavier than he himself , to earn his living .
back then , like today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we also worked .
there weren &apos;t any facilities and no heating . we hang@@ ed nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t stick at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without a papers in Iran and was ready for travel to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
for some time , A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in Parks and went to a church who shared twice a day of food to needy .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high ratings were given a kind of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true also that the terms that asylum seek@@ ers are dis@@ astro@@ us in the country .
the human rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers is accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; there are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prec@@ eded personnel . &quot;
according to the Italian Law asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially applied for asylum on asylum , which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money to have an accommodation either on the hospitality of friends , or need to sleep on the street .
thus , it was also called A@@ shar@@ af .
but his im@@ bi@@ al life helped A@@ shar@@ af to free herself from these conditions .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af had his entire savings into the establishment of a youth host@@ els in Venice .
it was so good that he opened a second hostel for a while , and a fast lim@@ b is opened .
the success story of the documentary &quot; Behin@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; after Venetian luxury , &quot; Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
a trans@@ itional solution to many of them is trans@@ itional solution to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afgh@@ an companies , including cutlery , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants have been created .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were all@@ ot@@ ted to the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Oriental experience , where the wa@@ it@@ ers and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells of the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ an .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals are far beyond the Italian food industry and retail , and aim to travel back to the country that he had forced to leave as teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country , and I can &apos;t live happy when I know my people suff@@ ers .
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and must get the same options as everyone else . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k also en@@ for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can learn the packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their crops and improve their financial situation . &quot; he says .
the successful entrepren@@ eur was a trip through in@@ security and doub@@ ts , but at the end stands stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .

the Egyptian parliament checks the bill to see that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after regist@@ ering with a government agency .
users would have to use in order to use the social networks , register and register their full name as well as their ID number within six months of using their complete name as well as their ID number .
those who have missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months , or the final punishment of a penalty .
the law , which was advert@@ ised by six@@ ty members of Parliament , is currently under legisl@@ ative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another deputy of deputy was filed , in which harder sanctions for the ins@@ ult to the President or a high officials would be introduced .
an Egyptian law is the off@@ ing of the President and state institutions already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , such acts would , however , be pun@@ ish@@ able by prison and fin@@ es , so right @-@ sex@@ ed at the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law should be adopted , this can mean up to three years &quot; imprisonment for the convicted judges .
also , this would strengthen political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years .
a distinctive example is the case of the Egyptian photograph@@ ers Mah@@ m@@ oud Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested by Egyptian polic@@ emen as he had been demonstr@@ ating violence against protest@@ ers who led to the military p@@ utsch against the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited so as more than 700 protest deleg@@ ates that had been arrested on the same incident , four years in prison on a court appointment .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th May , because the prison line failed to bring the accused from prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to an , so many human rights @-@ groups agree , e.g. weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and su@@ stain resistance .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalist H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage for pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the repor@@ ters Abdullah al @-@ F@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested during the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists to be sent to scanned documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the understanding of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was basically tried to negoti@@ ate an integrated action plan , which was explicitly supported by the President of the Republic , which , according to the plan , explicitly warrant the official am@@ nesty by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali , in@@ sof@@ ar as they return all un@@ lawful funds .
which published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds a light on how the formal plans for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources with st@@ ating Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code that guarantees the right to protect their sources .
however , he joined the Tunis County Court on 09 May as a witness in the case .
will China force social media users to present their ID ?
according to new rules of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the user of social media need approval in China before they write or share messages in social media .
in addition , the provisions will also be stated that registration will be required to full re@@ productive name .
anal@@ ysts assume that by using the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments within social networks , it is still un@@ clear as the authorities should apply these regulations .
Chinese networks have proposed in social media to protect these regulations only sel@@ ective to protect the civil journ@@ alism and its independence .
then we will see in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?

in May we opened the state c@@ ens@@ orship Russia &apos;s access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat was registered with the regional government as a &quot; organizer of the information spread . &quot;
