<seg id="1">Although I had visited the United States at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, American authors have read and run American music.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican cover, a fearless reporter with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura-Student, who were having inclined his interest in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "I was like that the absolute truth is, forget everything that is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only increased.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always say: "America is the only country in which I ever lived, its diversity is so welcoming that you can always be that you are and it is easily acceptance in a community of like minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very blackout love report about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came over.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the rulers and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me, how he proceeds with his engines.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells what he thinks like a former colleague, and explained openly about his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his testimony and tuned them in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won with republican pre-election, was the highest number one ever achieved by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans, who support this bigots person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was not able to harmonize trump and voters with people whom I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the Journalism program that takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing human being, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trump does not agree with the fact that Peter Bhatia did not agree with the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" watching the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump's intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I had experienced in Sandy Bahr, who struggling for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, which always helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, were my mentors who helped me a lot with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the embodied by them embodied my love in America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump confuses his way to nominal republican presidential data, they offered a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out to be the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whitish, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The idea with the idea that people voted for trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the trump-voters as rattle.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange people, "said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful, and indicates a inability to understand those who act in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hectic transformations in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters have voted for Trump, of which most have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, hardly anyone cannot forget the words of David Remnick, who repates the cruel decision, looking up a man who looks down with regard to those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (CEO of the WC): "as much as" obstructions of the White against all other ethorn "; pun of white in reference to the White and whiplash, what is so much like Scheffdertrauma), as was the great Van Jones called what America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background can always have, America is welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose the son of an Kenyman twice the story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise, and says: to Hell with diversity, freedom of religion and all the term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who was fallen in Iraq, and what he said at the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump," would have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America? "he asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd breaks out.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they responded.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no! they called them and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"could anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN!"</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "God be thanks, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land rejoiced for his son, sent a message to him.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's now Trump Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people looking like Mr. Khan could not find any more place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart to me.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero congregation in Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguan city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music, which is played on both places, is not only the life of children, but also a very close alliance with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby manic ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years La Banda de MÃºsica (Mbanger) has been playing in the commune: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has a possibility to overcome her surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A musical school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community that is located in one of the poorest provinces Mexico is known for its drugs abuse and the Banff violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this situation changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had so rare hopelessly.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, meaning the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their big passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come with smiling and play with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from the garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically on the largest landfill of Asuncion in Paraguay, capital - on instruments made from recycled plastic material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with restored instruments, made up of local fixed waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycler must have begun under the baton of Favio Chavez, parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, coelli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpets, trombone and percussion.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire encompasses classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local economist and musician of the children of Cateura, remembers the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach us at the same place. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact their parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed when Favio had been shown something he had never seen before: a string produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments of reprocessed material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary named "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic landfill dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tonnes of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who are living with him and of him are the most dangerous - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Land-fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle out of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played its music before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that strikes the wild illegal fishing industry.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports specific solutions for environmental issues.</seg>
<seg id="99">The release happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of contents.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already been operated in the Maltese waters of illegal fishing, before it was searching for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">According to the east African countries, the East African countries were slightly inclined to welcome a bill of bills of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comore, Mozambique and the Seychelles have speedified up against the ship. they refused to occupy one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing photo courtesy.</seg>

<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pillage of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects the criminal practices and protecting resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, in 2012 by NRO stop illegal fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network include the six countries in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, which then had driven out the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to locate it. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The obvious disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem will harm the delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing once were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail speed, these actions happen in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange rates of existing licenses for example, to suspect or experience any updates during a port inspector.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i persecuted the activities of ships even very attentive, when moving from the open sea through satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to identify ships which fish in forbidden regions. also, it can be evaporated road routes - such as such that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the Idealcase, such investigations may show if the participating ships have a fisheries policy, where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing may, on the basis of these information, may be denied the acceptance of such ships in their harbours. what means that the ships cannot be sold their cargo. and that they can even be forced to numbers from penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>

<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost revenues, which account for eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to the illegal fishermen, forming in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive fish fisheries, as it attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also illegal fishing fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among their practices, such as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licenware, statement by identikit name, fishes protected species and fish in nature-areas.</seg>

<seg id="124">Yet another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legal ablohole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its founding, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 examinations of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks, which had fake licences used in Tanzania. it discovered ships which used several deceitful identities and it has trapped volatile ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of its collaboration with Interpol, the international authority for the fight of crimes, FISH-i may share information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations lead us quite far to the organized crime" "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to produce more precise ships more precise.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be developed further, helps to hide the illegal ships.</seg>

"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch for example their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps build a system that connects different information levels together. it should help FISH-i to find criminal aggregate ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team can actually influence the global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth was opened together with Google and the Maritime conservation organization Oceana the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed all over the world by means of each trackable ship.</seg>

<seg id="141">We should do that in a global level. "" Pew Charitable Trusts "have a similar project in which a global system allows the pursuit of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detective but also scare off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which used to be confiscated without license and have barely given consequences of consequences, now they know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile a 33% increase in fishing-revenues, since fishing boats have more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">In fact, when FISH-i Somalia has helped, Greko 1 found inspectors there on board tow-nets which is prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of heavy demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government's proposal rejected the opposition of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, the Venezolans reacted to the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country to the void, as they were assembled on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (approximately: the backorder of Venezuela) can be found in both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also led in other parts of the country - among others in the North-land Barinas, in the Andes regions of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the centrally located Bundestaat Carabobo and at the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is continually deteriorated, which is reflected in the everyday life of veneers by a acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the guard of the current president NicolÃ¡s Maduro. ultimately, the maintenance of a new choice was held by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of government statement as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of social, political and economic crisis, the inflation rate of inflation was estimated at 500% (the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to regain its institutional structures and close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral union of Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or a short MUD (roughly: round table of the Democratic Unit), in which the opposition to the National Assembly met on October 27th as well as a march toward the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan State Congress, on November 3, should continue to expand the referencing of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter among other things, as follows:</seg>

<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic spends the round, which expelled the extent of suppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a counterpart in question - this has been proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street.</seg>

<seg id="208">Back then I could not realise that my father was a thief, the subsequent and murderer.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced the degree of atrocities during the years that he had experienced as a boy, and he said before a Bundesverfassungsgericht) against his father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent's parent, and how this child chose a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went with us to the sports hall. there I had friends with a boy, martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All of them called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo, and urged me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You're a dickhead, you have been friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass, just that they don't deceive you one day, and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, a Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers "Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he offered to go back to the sports hall again. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would be secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. because so my father had moved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the base of the military point, I had to destroy the prisoners who had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university caps, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, prowandamaterial, books, simple everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'as they are over there the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me altogether four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the first and last time he left me in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to get out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little wrapped around a blanket and told me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great mourning silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were shut down and entertained me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured there.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in it and saw a couch that were tortured on man.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field of field and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later, I found out that they paved the way an end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who had been captivated there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They rarely fake a man with handcuffs on the bed, overpoured it with water and sent him a load of 220 volts to the genitals.</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: ComisiÃ³n Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The stench there was foul odly... like a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later when my father was under house arrest, the same odour came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in distress.</seg>
<seg id="246">I have never forgotten that smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another?</seg>
<seg id="248">'i knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he took me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were captivated with palms and were tied to the eye.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke to "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilian who was also accused in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses, on which naked people lay with the face down - all were bound of hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Near the entrance settled people quietly on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father noticed that I looked to the prisoners, he said, "Do you see, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I denied, "Why did you bring me up?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and were buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me home.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero spread a man there and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">(according to details of survivors, Jorge Romero who was also indicted in the La Perla-Ribera process were accused of death by students of RaÃºl Mateo Molina.</seg>
<seg id="261">The following video is emitted by Emilio Fessia, the director of the La Perla Memorial.</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came in here is also the way that they came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">If you look on the map, you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">When torture was taken over, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra till the arrangement of above came to be relocated.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - Euphrism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their corpses in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war spoils'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all the things stolen from home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that age, I had no idea what the "nyield" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was later at the military, I was in Gendarmerie - I realized that war spoils are a bayonet or perhaps a military sign that is fought on one enemy that is fought against.</seg>
<seg id="271">Luis Alberto Quijano with his son.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if one goes into a house and put the fridge, the turntables, clothing, paintings, money... ascendeth, that is not a war of war, but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always asked myself how my father, the head of security forces, could join this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">As an officer at Gendarmerie and me it would never be incurred to enter a house and steal all this.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do this.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminal and I said: and you, who hurst the car on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not criminals?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded in rage, struck me and shouted:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, then I will find you and slay you.</seg>
<seg id="283">We need none other to do this!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I testified in the trial, I showed a photo of back then, on which I wore a jacket and a rolling hand knit of wool. both had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defense accused me of being a prisoner of this crime. I resisted, no problem, they can lay hold on me what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to speak.</seg>
<seg id="290">'The disappearance of the body is the last abomable act "</seg>
<seg id="291">Now where I am older, I feel remorse.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. once you have children, one recognizes the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops, and recognizes that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Well, you were executed during the dictatorship. but why the bodies let disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why do children deceive?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father got a girl with his home, whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They would have simply put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why their corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Were these people not even families, who were able to pass their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abomable act that you can do one person.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when democracy was again introduced, they fetched machines to eliminate the remains of prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were crushed and nowhere, no idea where ever. "you'll never find anything," my father said.</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything remains, of course.</seg>
<seg id="307">'i've seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">To clear it, I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said just the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea to show my father arose during a conversation he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him dignife because of all the atrocities that I had to suffer because of him.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he said, "I don't know. I have not killed anyone."</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt comforted and asked me what all the exaggerated patriotism and the "Western and Christian feelings," which they allegedly defended, were actually good.</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I shouted:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something?</seg>
<seg id="317">I saw how you killed man!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed horrible crimes and you were forced me to participate.</seg>
<seg id="319">He only questioned "Now then show me up."</seg>
<seg id="320">Precisely that I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010, I got the first ad.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">No one can foresee that I was prejudiced. I eventually told my own father.</seg>
<seg id="324">Luis Alberto Quijano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing still before the end of the trial.</seg>

<seg id="344">The sign with the translation error in a center in Kyoto, where you can prolong his driving licence.</seg>
<seg id="345">This photo was disseminated in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Edited by Joshua Levine's original photos.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers became a newly opened centre where one can prolong his driving licence in the last month, witnesses of a very special translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a shield the japanese word which means "the older drivers" means, wrongly - but perhaps also with bad background thanks & # 8212; as "terrific drive" was translated.</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from September 1 to 20 in electronic ads in the input field and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Edited by Joshua Levine, the original photos used in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was like a translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyra, who was also aware of the local timings on it.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun, which is published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">This was initially a faulty English translation. "" "" "" "(German:" terrific drivers ") was later replaced by the appropriately naming term" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ").</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto police apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator, and that the translation was not inspected for their correctness before it was released.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger told her about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are really sorry that elderly people felt offended by the insufficient correction (the translation) on our part," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News continued to deal with the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terribly" was approached as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the number of older drivers who are nationally involved in accidents, but are not a reason to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture for example, 1,941 of 19.460 cases of seniors were caused by seniors in 2005. that equals a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors 1,803 from altogether 11.850 unwastes.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">Whereas the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of seniors resulting in the same period have risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The reportedly called reporter brought the light to the light published on the Yahoo published article in Yahoo, which show the prejudices of some Japanese to older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo talked about the translation mistakes was, among others, the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" terrific drivers ") just about reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="370">- "I don't think that it's a real translation error."</seg>
<seg id="371">There are not a few such comments.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation defects are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">We need two key skills: passive language skills, to understand the original text, and an active language skills to get him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something which is in case of native speakers. generally, convinced that translators should not be in the language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native language should translate French into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ employees with English as a native language to translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding, cost reasons or the relatively small amount of English speakers, to learn to be Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies who have no foreign employees, but will make translations pedestabinternally. then the Japanese staff, whose English language skills are perceived to become translators - no matter how good or bad its language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The provertebrate and enigmatic sentences that are formed by machine translation can, show that this technique can still be replaced without a human translators. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints, often used t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation mistakes may be acceptable or at least harmless. however, by big companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: News Protests and Censical Measures on the Internet and Television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan internet users, they wouldn't have access to the online station Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later other users have signed that Internet performances from VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="394">Also other online radio broadcasted recordings of the protests in Caracas, which have been organized by oppositionable groups, who oppose the government NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">Protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and the Parliament's duties to the executive body and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is linked, and recommended to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access Internet access.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet's web servers are closed again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offerings like Vivoplay are popular among Venezolaners with internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report on the coverage of protests since 2014, when they would continue to report on the demonstrations, when the Commission continued to report this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">With no cable TV and informative national television channels, I have logged in @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Astounding, that it's still cheaper than to buy two litres of sodas.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro confirmed that it is not only Vivoplay by blocking the domain name System (DNS), but also two other online radio stations. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers their sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research institute for the Company of Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, showed that the local network of Internet companies can sometimes use DNS. the DNS Server requests of certain domains may be erroneous.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server does not reply or refuses the request when calling one such website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">In VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was discontinued on Thursday 6th April, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who recorded the protests in Caracas, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while it was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV returned to broadcast again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government was regulated via YouTube: thus, the Venezolanians will always be more difficult to access multimedia reports about the current events in the country.</seg>
<seg id="412">In Paraguay, many girls are to become a slave to get education</seg>
<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a child of Criminita. now she visits the house in which she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today, Tina fights for the rights of children and gathers testimony of other criaditas that were just like victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="415">Photo by Cecilia Rojas. use courtesy of Kursky.</seg>
<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report by Kurhaus, which will be published by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series with the title "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que Caen" ("flying cows, random schools), edited by Global Voices in Latin America and re-published.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household in which she did not live together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before she graduated from the university, she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride on her. "she is like a daughter for us."</seg>
<seg id="420">Those who have become something from the somewhat is, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began working as criadita for the family. as criaditas proclaims the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes their underage son or her younger daughter to another, wealthy family. in exchange the child will receive food, training and roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned, however, is that the children will have to pay for it countless days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that can be done within the framework of an agreement you cannot lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called criadazgo is widely distributed in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by great parts of society and despite numerous complaints for human rights.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduation, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke to Criaditas. especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - accumulated witness testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">They tried to mention things in name, as the feeling of gratitude, which is vaccinated by Crimean itas, is generally not guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double illusion," says Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, who completed her daughter in the belief that they would like to complete their education, can improve their position in society and "can take something out of himself," to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that takes up the girl with him and whose exploitation is justifiable with faith that they would give them a chance that otherwise no training would get any training and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criado</seg>
<seg id="433">If the girl is harassed, his family will learn about many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never hear about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in paraguayan households, has got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n was taken to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of severe impacts. shortly after she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criminita in the household of former military staff TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who as an officer at the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n was living with them in her house in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants, located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira slammed with a stick to MarÃ­n until she suffered a deadly injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">She emphasized that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply rooted practice of the criadazgo into the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest petitions that there was "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely distributed throughout the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," failed Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">It is much easier without papers to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The wife's neighbours and almost 60 civil society organizations demanded an inquiry into the event.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was her criadita to be sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n may be incidental - if for the first time in history of Paraguay a case of Crimean azgo will occur in court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Cribs are not only exploited as labour, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik in which her father worked, bankrupt and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all the work and started to sell on the street or market cuisine to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all continued to school.</seg>

<seg id="460">In their employers Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to split the time so that you still had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, purified the refrigerator, cleaned the living room, polished furniture and also the ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she was done with learning, the more leisure time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited, because they had to have dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says, she never had to starve, but did not get unlimited food. "I was allowed to fetch more books from the house of the landlord as food from the fridge." she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizant of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroumner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings the landlord Alvarenga, in addition to him stand and Editorial reacts from Oppositionaries, such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to persuade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media.</seg>
<seg id="471">But he was standing for intelligent, but didn't entertain himself with her. "the landlord had found someone who heard it while he spoke about politics," she says.</seg>

<seg id="474">She, however, was perfectly clear that she had paid for everything she had paid with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing, which almost never spoken, are bullying and the chicans who are exposed to Criaditas when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, cricket is criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I could not invite anyone home to me. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, at the time where friendships develop, I felt very clear that I did not belong to any group.</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this certain kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining smoker in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and the awareness of the ecosystem can also depend on that a big predatory is present.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo responsible for the north-east Japan, Kahoku Shimpo, had been advocating the lives that had been hit by the "Thirty disaster" in March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima happened.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahocu Shimpo paper has its headquarters in Sendai, which lies in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was one of the prefectures in Japan, which had to do both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring islands of Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had all the coastal cities of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even more recently the Fukushima prefecture still had an accident accident, but only about 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Special Report of Kahoku Shimpo shows a local view that progress has been reached for six years, to rebuild the life of the city.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment complex in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (in which saigai koun juutaku) in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were finished.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures could see Miyagi, 80 per cent of the planned spare buildings were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima joined the final light in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even though, six years after the disaster, one endeavored to be evacuated by cohabit, and to change mitigsu yutaku) of final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold disaster, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such Behausungen.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the evacuation from Fukushima still live in emergencies, while Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated, which were haughted after the disaster, were moved to final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures of prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">How the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by the disaster in December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation, only 30 percent of fishing ports operate their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and the atomic accident, involved in the three prefectures of agricultural land, have been involved.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land used in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only a result of the atomic fact is, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed farmland of Fukushima, lying in the nuclear power zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered far away, but Fukushima still stays far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima can now have only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahou Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coast people, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine the overall image, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacuations. they questioned about the status of rebuilding and also how their feeling is changed compared to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article Kahoku Shimpo explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahocu Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the local population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of the local population has taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those respondents have still not been done enough in catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture,</seg>
<seg id="576">In her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the position of evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture also witnessed the worst, disasters, atomic accident that had to be experienced in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">About 63 000 evacuation from Fukushima were installed in the areas outside the prefecture, almost 63 000 people from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">In early 2016, a little more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, have been resettled to permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand still 40 000 inhabitants live on Fukushima outside of its home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In emergencies the majority of the evacuated areas of war are most likely to repay them. they have to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima, with massive construction projects, which are part of the Olympic Games, which will be part in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, after a while we often see that it connects more than it at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important because they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives, and remind us of the fact that the world is very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at exactly these global links. in our Into the Deep podcast, we discuss topics that often get less attention as they deserve.</seg>

<seg id="625">The Unction of Forgotten Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Act of Ãlvaro Reynoso, close to hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba knocked the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The local community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there is no notable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It's two years ago when the activities were laded in the sugar cane mill.</seg>
<seg id="629">After rising the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost its systems until only the frame was left of steel and concrete.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent itself.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resign and commute every day to the factories, which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, rising every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not make his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there is still in the east of the region of sugar cane manufactured after a long inactive period because they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers exactly that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but that promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry urts the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for this country a few decades ago, but the bad harvest has been no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane powered?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway tracks of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they became unlockable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">Initial idea was to concentrate production on most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories and they can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nonetheless the sugar price increased again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 until 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report "Landwirtschaftskammer Filters" from the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would generate roughly 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's Day will be with security in history," that was the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shut down of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene as a soldier is known as a soldier, is talking about the closure of the factory, is the word that he repeats most, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents say that the same opinion was not one of them informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">Thus, they formed a full time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the opening year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially licensed documents that would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed, addressing the date and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All of those were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any decision.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, responsibility and letters came more and more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge of two years for the lactate factory and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money" covered by the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years waiting for the retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in his will at the resignation of the factory, whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he demonstrated one of his 31 years of work.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations Young people use Hip-Hop to express themselves and get their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Recording of a song by "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations Community Communities in Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them. they do they with Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop manager mobile sound studios have been offering directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate young songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then cooperated with the Cree Hip Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in talks, such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptable" or whatever could be found in the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which youths are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyllak'yoo tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a roadmap in Westkanada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to mediate, as importing traditional customs and customs of war despite the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, even though the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoohi Cree first nation has recorded, refrain will be sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people, who participated here, received some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstars Hip Hop Group, who gave them a stanza in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the stanza is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like I wouldn't ever be interested in me.</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth.</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day where you will take our scream</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way of life in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise up one day.</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how to live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and lead to our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do that for what purpose of the Creator,</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary part, the reader and supporters of the Cree-Language Kevin Brousseau also provides a post and add the stanza in Silbenz (which is also published on his blog and published here with approval):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, what is exactly on the menu, will be in the proximity of the entrance to shokuhin sanpuru (which seem to be present in the restaurant "plastic models of dishes") of each dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes, then decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry devoted to manufacturing these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo District of Kappabashi, there is a variety of these small companies that just produce those plastic dishes, which documented the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most of Japan, these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they don't even invite them anymore. a new trend, however, is transformed into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matters, the blogger itinii published a number of social media links and photos which show this unusual twist with the shokuhin rolling puru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new with plastic dishes decorated phone tapes, as shown in the Kichiyoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been converted to kitschy collection objects, as in this case, cold barrier magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shoes Kupresso magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essence is increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaans-don (a popular route with seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">This part is also made for the exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that delivers your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to display like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the country.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile devices and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon has been swindated, a popular topping with white rice is served.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">There's somebody who would say: "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile-stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and knit bands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skurrile plastic dishes can look at: itinii's Naver Matching blog post. or follow on Twitter using the hashtag #</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of the trends, then this video gives you an insight into the quarter Kappabashi, which devotes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry. such as with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made.</seg>
<seg id="745">A Mexican project tells stories about survivors of struggle against organised crime</seg>
<seg id="746">"the victims of struggle against" drug traffickers "victims.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of national and foreign media on the notorious "fight against drug trafficking in Mexico" the mixes and the killed regularly appear in statistics. however, these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy that brings the struggle with himself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug warbosses like El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa cartridge, thrones the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day following a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourn or the churches which have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each glue, behind every bone finds in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, boys and friends, friends and partners, their wounds can never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal TripÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprila Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "dealing with the drug trafficking"), that told these victims, and stories about people who are caught in the struggle between the prosecutions of authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime will not only be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close, because they are threatened by drug traffickers and whole congregations will need to drive many kilometers to something as many as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cambothor el miedo" (German: "how fear changes") is telling these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for every weekend secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez pleaded not to her father only one day, her siblings, her husband and two of their nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have been ready to go and searching for graves, to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28, when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13, he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">October 15th, he was supposed to be back, but he never returned. "Emma Veleta:" it is very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is my mother, too, who is also with me here.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment, she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are entitled to an insurance of my father, but she does not pay them out because they are asking a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprroa Vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We have to show only the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility, and state guidance.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a readers of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never consider normal, in whatever form it appears:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been acquainted with disease and sensational journalism since a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass every day to newspaper kiosks and see the title pages with images that can actually come from a textbook for Criminology or files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It takes me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is widened or sad. it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to the body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin will think that he is great (German: drug trafficker) if he is great. and it is also not normal that people will hear songs over the "heroism" of the perpetrators if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, it is like those who have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear of them that happens so something.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are becoming blogging numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to persuade them to stay away from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the report "Four months of blackmail in the Capital District: like a family with threats, it describes how armed crime broke out for month's money till it was not only destroyed business, but also their family torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything you've lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain will never expire, the trauma remains, fear comes again, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they kill or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I wondered in those terrible days if I would like to dissolve my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, for I forgot to live like you cries. I must learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the contribution "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence marked by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it, in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he relates that he had to teach himself how to make an egg, potatoes cooked, tortillas and warm "chichi" for the babies that live with him. this is his name for the preparation of vial with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He talks about the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unutterable for a boy to whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he had only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody carche of his father was killed by armed men out of a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation looked like in JuÃ¡rez:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence committed by organized crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders on public security and the government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor counted 3103 Morde. this corresponds to average of 8,5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invaded the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories still live in view of always new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprila Vivir Con El Narco" initiated the journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment in which it comes to raising a rumor or unfold a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But what is the years after the first surfaced? content in social media, no matter whether true or true, tend to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been used to educate tragedies, which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of photo and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denies no fact that there is a lot of careful reporting about events in the DRC, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But there is a question about our longing for pictures on news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, stoned and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and devastated. the streets in the region have become more difficult to drive fighting, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Ironically, the fuel tank fell victim to the fuel tank.</seg>
<seg id="828">The Government officials described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a cinemas near, that was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">The houses burned down and scattered corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.more photos of the previous day are the most horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">There are rows of low bodies lined up on the floor while looking at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">The same photo was mashed several times over the years on social media, blogs and other platforms, but is incorrectly attributed to real life, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">The Boko Haram attacked the unoccupied Nigerian settlements of Baga and Doro Gowon on 3 January 2015.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses report drastically from atrocities, in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports of which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">However, the figures could not be confirmed. "no one remained behind to count corpses" said a person to Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were carved, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only by satellite images the follow-time could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack remained unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt to win the Boko Haram military to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerge from the DR Congo, as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of misauthorized tenders; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria as of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the image was introduced as a proof of mass economies.</seg>
<seg id="852">Yet another step further provides personal comments, such as this example, in the DRC with sources of mass media related to the sources of mass media.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture of Sange has also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning bolt, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported by the violence against the Rohingya, postfinance such as the following on how these descriptions made with photos from the DRC:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture was taken by an Saudi-Arab news page, which said in 2012 that President Myanmars Thein I said, monks and politicians would have been involved in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was accessed on April 26, 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations, the AFP as their source, had likewise attributed to His being this statement, but were not associated with the image of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The global range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of this false coupling are to date back to the years 2011 and 2012, and actually come from anywhere around the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using an "reversed picture search" you can see how far information can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">A reversed picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures below 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017) 344 pictures, which are very similar to the previous picture of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed mash private sites, platforms of social media and communal areas and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have routed false reports, others have attempted to unfold the counterfeits.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have jurisdiction for the misuse of use and associated with the respective countries, based on which page they have been published. thus, we want to display the range more clearly than by language alone.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes and frames (frames) that pass this post. the first frame focuses on Religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to larger discussions about silence in connection with the assassination of Christians through Muslims or - in the defence of Muslims - assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how to underestimate an African life in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion do not want to understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore it's worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers may no longer grant this pictures longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are many people who are inadvertently advertently to trample the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugars this mood of false and falsehood information that are real atrocities untrue and tasted it the real atrocities that actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of forcible pictures was already debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the back of pictures of a refusal is to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images will even be asked by the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent pictures readers and spectuses are desiring to feel empathy (such as such a study conducted among others to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to be discussing over the news media, the fact that it is essential for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologist would need to experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News" which, in which a picture suggests a somewhat suggests, which is actually replaced by the context or completely misused manner.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation of false breeding, however, should also consider how internationally they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Imtranslatable (Z. B. indestructible) tries to offer voice enthusiasts to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudi-de) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But they all resist a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, why a full explanation as well as something context is required to understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite some time.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and Linguist of "Untranscendable" Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog, one finds words from the Manuatu's tax-lap as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Praise your parents in recognition of what strives to have tried for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - conconvenience or sloth, which you feel after you warmed up on cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words out of his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They sneak other cultures, unveil another ideas and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, you influence how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this page to show more this "irreplaceable" words and present how different, valuable, and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages," which are highly appreciated by transtranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="1002">I have already managed this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have known me for years - the Sahar that they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims," which has established itself in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They Muslim me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion different.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with that Muslim, to different species. but somehow we all are put in the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims, who do not fit in it, become Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To become Muslim Brotherhood</seg>
<seg id="1011">I am not struggling with it alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This even happened to the poet, whose poetry is most widely sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died, the center of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western style religion was deleted, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deletion makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims from this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another exists in the reduced images of Muslims, which had been colonized by western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This tempting language is determined by the dark man that you should fear and the exotic woman you should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">In the 1970s, the pioneering Palestinian scientist Edward Said devised the story behind these paintings.</seg>

<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood remain they continued.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I saw how these powerful, incorrect narratives have dominated our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative shadowed the reality that has led to nine Muslim women through their countries over the last three decades, while the U.S. in 2016 could not even choose their first female presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This scrative will fail to realize that if French, Muslim women are prevented from applying her headscarf into public buildings and to cover sudi-Arab, Muslim women through their government to cover its entire body, that both are both sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group does not exercise his "control" on the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This powerful narrative weakens Muslim women who lead movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil from Africans, which were brought along with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has become deeply and flawed, so often Sikh-men and children become the target of intimuslimic attacks and chicanings.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of those stories we tell us and because of the way we tell them is Islamophobia not only fear of Islam, the religion, but fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">Which belong to the 1.7 billion</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we are doing more than just stories based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or to alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create narratives, which help us understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry has failed because it failed to capture the scars of the 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Storytelling, by Flickr member Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, the founder of the initiative of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is an answer to stories in their original language.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices said recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the Indispropable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and strangle the language variety of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, is risk that small and not quite as small languages can not be shared with children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the part of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world's language may be avoided, if we want cities to assume diversity - safe rooms in which residents do not forget who they are to belong in.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listen is often associated with understanding," reward these events instead "listening to esteem, make, and make."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers return their story first in their own language and translate them and then explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not a professional storyteller, their surrender means and their presentation that listeners allow to be inaudible.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round the storyteller Rassidatou had also taken the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative of their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the beak from bunnies and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his beak, John Nyamusara will be asked: "how is it possible to speak to a crowd that does not understand your language?" he shares his sense of inconsistency:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They listened to it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were completely with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of the Treasure Language Storytelling in three cities took place, and the organizers hope to expand this. all that are inspired by the project can contact TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for the USA reconstitution of state debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new testing of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which accounts for 72 million US dollars on a mass rally; the march took part in the army of the capital Capitol, the capital building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">Proclaimed by the grouping of Frenchman Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda, "(the Civil front for the Neuruation of Debt) and the ÃComenian Church in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the debt restructuring have also submitted an petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rican calls for politicians, bankers and government agencies that are responsible for their debts to their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We demand financial examination and a leadership committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions such remuneration that agulates in favour of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are expressing and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rican refused to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not take off with sinking pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand instant measures.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not in the United States State level - suffers from a heavy financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Hence the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a governing non-profit organization without party membership with focus on the socio-economic development, a law for state responsibility, as an alternative to existing state authority.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Ros require a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">The measures imposed on the outside are run without the participation and conviction of the citizens of danger to be rejected by the people.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is missing a year for over one year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members put the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">During this year's re: publica, annual conference for digital culture, hosted in Berlin, was devoted to the event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©riie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of Book Sprints' completed books within three to five days, read excerpts from the Book Prize of Freedom: a Collective Inge (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and here is free of charge, includes a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of suppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book aims to identify how movements are constructed for free knowledge and what the real costs are linked to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, researchers and writers, who are involved in the movements of free knowledge, have side on page to look over the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create something sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartabil, the Beloved and celebrated Internet Volunteer, which has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of the Adra prisons, which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture, many of us start thinking about their own destiny, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of time-making extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and Digital activist has been the term of Syrian government agencies for March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the Military Court out of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi told that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, which stood by himself as the insider of the Assad administration and put them knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in establishing access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technician and at the moment the leader of New Palmyra, a project founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle cultural prototypes were more foaming than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the pioneering of various civilizations and here merges greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel had not yet known that for ten years after he began working with this work, that IS it all about doing this architecture, embodied not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This stripe into the digital archaeology and the preservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public and for academics and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">According to this project, Bassel had not finished yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life with them, as dreaming, and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge, which he asked. he taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened me the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without which it actually stopped in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him, and he translated them from Arabic to English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is licensed free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book covers from Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book written by Nora with the title "It happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens at every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I see in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace you,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That doesn't matter to me any of the dangers,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, bonds and guardians</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the feeling of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I went into every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I carry with passion,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes will say farewell</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I leave you another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return quickly to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To regain all those moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And about your absence to cry and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I witness myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the arrest of Bassel wrote Ghazi:</seg>
<seg id="1243">A year passes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">While on the</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of the Monster</seg>
<seg id="1247">So, history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">According to the protests against the Bashar al-Assads regime, in 2011, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights), more than 65,000 people disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested, or executed under violence by the regime, were tortured or executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Since 2011, at least 17.723 Syrians died in prison according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we repeat our demand in the hope we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption, director of the post upheld re-release again</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique acted with anger to a corrupt, in which a government member went back after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus, in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is where Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other accused, sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other accused.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose Council became Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was set free in 2016 for a good leadership and immediately called his return to the company, which took place on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which gave the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to re-relate to his old post, since the company had no discipline relating to his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people are not doing the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The centre of public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), an local institution, which defends itself to public transparency, sentenced to an interview with Deutsche Welle, the decision of the company to put the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Poses a setback in the fight against corruption and emphasises the lack of transparency and even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, thus the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">The firm, however, apparently has no adequate legal steps to apply the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a major voice in the Muslim social media, refuses this behaviour and considered the case as a "refusal":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be sented after he was sentenced to a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay paid speeches and motivating speeches, he could advise and to poise his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has endorsed to reintegrate into the company which he helped damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: cambaza is likely to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political sciences, says the director no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza, being rewarded by the state, because he is not able to believe that someone who has rewarded someone in such a way that has already heavily insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing to return the morality and serve the state * he had already a unique opportunity to serve the state, but he only served by the state instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state to become a inexhaustible source of money and the state itself, this man is weary who was charged and eventually condemned to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to recall the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, of which a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel not only as the first independent president in memory, but also as a sharp, one-cutter and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, as an energetic person, confirmed that "an ambitious human is, even the fatherland for his ambitions, to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that this is not so. it changes the tactic, but he does not change from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious human is criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also disapproving:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was condemned to 22 years in prison, he sat down for 10 years and escaped.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company deals with him, in which he deepened, again under the contract. # AzsimVaiOMeuPais - which teams compete in the area (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo of the magazine @ Verdade (born in German: @ truth) reveals that crime is paid in Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users injustice</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or spellage.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is normally used to refer to people East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective.</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or, hand-hand (in burial Scriptures) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the Hasslanguage in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise has given rise to radical nationalist movements in the word.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hassessation against Muslims who are a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hassle in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">Today, Kalar's usually might be associated with racism, but the word itself doesn't call Hassin automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people also reported that, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts to express its use, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burial words with different meanings, which have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', what the same letters contains, as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(Spage),' Kalar Oat '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookutzer Aung Kaat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was now deleted, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in witty ways if they couldn't know how he could alleviate his back pain by making a vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set ku la - "Healing" (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but its context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win HAS is the opinion that she will decrease radical nationalists, but stressed that Facebook analytics, before it deletes it all posts that deduce racism from racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1306">This automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write to Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, check the post carefully and check it by checking the words above.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (sphere of age).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these dirty nationalists, who spread the language, get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to be pruning to nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action you like to send a strong signal to all the Hasslanguage, the efficiency of this strategy should not be maintained long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have often been demonstrated that users of social networks will just start to use a new word, or an alternative spelling of the same word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook started to delete his postings as he just wanted to share his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to inform about my Facebook friends that the word is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from the liken, post and sharing of content for 24 hours, because the Post "doesn't pay the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a multitude of posts about people who have no negative views, or just try to show their opinions against the radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed, which has nothing to do with Hassin:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hassany of Facebook removed.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his mind about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khan believes that Facebook is supposed to have more would do before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet Community asked for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook like a benevolent aim to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">To blame such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they started with no local context or technical support and such words as "chair" or "Patrisencurry" have been forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the forcidated Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they would have more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a big turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care of much spit among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it serious, users now make fun of Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasslanguage to see if their posts are removed from the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook postings which have no hassle abstained but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and take a look at the Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just trying to try out if Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The mail says "If you are a doctor, then heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, social networks have used to expand their voices and influence, increasing.</seg>
<seg id="1337">In social networks, social networks should also heat violence in the municipalities of Myanmar in particular, especially in the Rakhine area where thousands were forced to escape between Muslims and Buddhists thousands of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been critical for his failure to investigate balancing hassle on his burial sites.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The Children's Church is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago and Tobago now.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament adopted unanimously a law that aims to ban this practice, so that the full age of age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the adulterment, some members of Hindu and Muslim communities were gathered in practice, and in May 2016 she came to a large public outcry. at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leaders of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state does not interfere with the maturity of maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This was evident from the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contracting partner of the UN's Child Convention; the minors as, for every man under the age of 18. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011 the Statistical Office of the country confirmed that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were endeavoured to abolish laws on child's before, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly they helped bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leaders, for example, had no concerns to say the critics of the children's before, they should take care of their own business. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition atched to tension in this uncomplicated case, and at some point doubts came up if the opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But early in 2017 the bill was decided against child before - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent which he contained in a House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must approve and proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which picked up the Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of bill against child before was approved at the House of Representatives with 35 votes in favour, and not only one of them.</seg>
<seg id="1357">When he was previously decided in the Senate, the project can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media user was thrilled because the laws have been changed for children before.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who was a Minister of Ministers in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary talk used that has spurred the core of the cause, but do you know what? the children before is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegally, and that is worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was the mind, it was definitely long enough to create the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was happy that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says: idea, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The adultery has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 on this - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">The Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society which is right openly about the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age of age in Trinidad and Tobago must now be independent from the religious affiliation of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft to change the copyright Act was approved today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 members of the House of Representatives, 35 of which were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members who were committed to the law have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The Children's Church is not permitted by law in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long struggle (...) # childrots pardon.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Thanks to all the activists who have conspired against him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook is therefore in the form of Sat Maharaj, which is the Secretary-General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the well-known Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj has announced his intention to take judicial steps, should the law be adopted and it seems to come into its promises.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, a feeder of the law, said it was quite legitimately, if Maharaj was against the law, for most social media users, you would wish to change the debate differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell thought:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we are taking place instead of discussing the discussion, in a way that we would say, instead of talking about the problem, that we might need to inform the state into our bedroom, that they may be abused by big, hard-hard men who are against them in advantage, would you be ready to carry out the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe it is not about a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But if there is a judicial procedure against the law, or not, this law is an important step - but there are still places in the world on which the children's before in different gradations are legal or remain the norm, even though there laws exists.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By the mirrors of websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content.</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia article was published on 18 January 2012, contradictory on the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally blacked.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than one month Turkey closed the popular and crowd-out encyclopedia (Wikipedia).</seg>
<seg id="1394">The day is more obvious, how important the platform for users is to find and share useful information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many independent Internet users are used to use relocking tools for blocked websites (a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), the most common Wikipedia users did not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been closed from Wikipedia in 2008, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University have been regularly reviewed after the Internet Act (No. 5651).</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the most well-known country in the world, when it comes to massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">As the platform remains closed, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform put off all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (so calculator machine computers), which does not make any censorship in the system of domain names.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content is irrevocable despite the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the messages (via the lock of Wikipedia), we put all about snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform, so the possibility of reading the content on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they don't have the website of www.wikipea.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also contributed that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia project, and it just concerns screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansitender.org, a mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to hoist similar mirrors, when in the country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and employee of Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses a different URL, which is not the original. that what one then sees is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">By essence, the server is leading the application on the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia by yourself, when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagrat Giri was with the photos he looked around, never satisfied. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to carry him a camera in itself, trying to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was one child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar is trying to bring Neptune to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And its homeland is right next to the Chitwan National Park, offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that divert attention to Nepals wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, as this first class location helps with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it give better for a passionate wild photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home, when suddenly Navaraj had invited me (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) and got a call from my father, that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The River dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was, and I immediately began squeezing pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar assists in cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal as nature and want to deepen the understanding of the wild animals that wild animals are not as terrifying as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he already stood face to face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturb by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also, because of the darkness, I was on the way home, when the King of the Buheavik appeared. he sits upon us and he sat on with the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar is placed the logo "I click for Conservation (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepalese and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to take in Bardia National Park photos of Otters. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger, and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was republished here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with great care prevent the name of their husbands or even more from older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">By Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh, women give to respect the husband on the basis of the social pressure, and fear of the consequences ought to disregard these practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Omela by a shattering speech and had driven by her family and the village community after having addressed a secret gene with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition also not mention their wives by name, is also common among men. however, they have far fewer curiosities to fear, if any, they should not follow these practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health specialists and housewives, belonging to a unique club and became the main speculating theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, where they discuss and discuss the intriceness of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which there are in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # Khelbadal, which is used by the Community Video Volunteers and sets up for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the coverage of practices, such as children's marriage to the ban of HIVI and AIDS-infected persons.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made ambassador to the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in their discussion round, was by women who call their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this topic, because she wanted to open a talk about the patriarchate with a problem with which women can identify slightly.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To speak according to their husbands is a custom, which they all upheld and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition shows that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not keep this, is regarded as deceitful, as woman without moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round about it.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning Rohini, who had never called her husband so far on behalf, wanted to try home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Shell telling:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband weigh only long after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned back to me, and said, I should call him of his name now.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage, Rohini gained its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to carry out discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they asked them all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does it mean that they cannot respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas of the village of Walh in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries old tradition in which men had never left the names of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Shell telling:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only kered during the whole exercise but a different decided to leave the whole frustration to him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her faces was ecstatically.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenal rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they stopped their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Over the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put into her head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner from the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">She turned herself in her mother in her mother, she was afraid, saying that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A participant's husband was less understandably and the situation existed in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc-red spot on the forehead, indicating the spouse status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the zinc-red point if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not complete with it, but mine, they are now in better position to choose itself, not to carry him on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women a discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we have a trip at each discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I do not want to worry that women don't worry who would hear what, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months in their lives they celebrated their own birthdays with cake; they danced and talked about things about which they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have some things, for example like our identities to our husbands, have never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to tell some things, no matter how small it appears.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour, and how it is connected with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is that okay, but some wanted a Salwar course, a wide shirt over a trousers, wear; they didn't dare to tie.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much argument and discussion on the advantages of their own coat of clothes, the morals connected to the saris and much more, rough Rohini their own pair of course (upper shirts) in a discussion round, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa for which they can wear jeans and the Rohini is sure they can be created.</seg>
<seg id="1531">In the question that in the five months had somewhat changed since its first discussion club, Rohini confirmed that things come slowly into the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but they listened to her husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, enclosed, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now bear Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in a discussion club know that the changes they wish to achieve in their lives - like the feeders for more freedom of movement or its own coat of movement - at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">As they give each other confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club is every one of us confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tell other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1547">The Beatles during her landing in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1548">Screenshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On June 29 this year, the hashtag was set to prove that many fans exchanged memories of the Japanese Twitter trend and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered a reversal in Japanese culture of postwar years.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles of 1964 in London, marked the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just five days the Beatles have been in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">People here soon became clear that they had no other choice when the Beatles were receiving with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached its zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," told Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retailers Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! the Beatles-commemoration Day in Japan. more than 51 years ago, they were here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Today, songs of the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and sung in English classes.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Kitch of the Beatles survived everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today Beatles-commemoration is.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" should be directed at John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it belongs to fans, Japanese of course also make pilgrimage to the well known places connected with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">When you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you absolutely must visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be scurrile enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today Beatles-commemoration is.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the film K-On! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">The same year we did last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies use the fans market-based technologies, such as this Ramen-Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen! the today is Beatles-Remembrance.</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for one day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">I will listen to YESTERDAY today and I will eat Ramen-noodles at Mutaro Koya.</seg>

<seg id="1592">This led to the UN 2016 mission a mission conducted in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of men with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government struggles to fight this superstition and judice.</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention to the international community of attention, after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized due to liver canceres in the endsetting.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state risk) after being involved in the draft of the Charta 08, a manifesto that the democratic reforms had been involved in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China said Lius case referred to as "an internal matter." he told it as "not required to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Yet China continues to stand by the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poetess Liu Xia, freeing or allow him treatment abroad.</seg>

<seg id="1637">Mohammad Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>

<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were continued until December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to add the salmon to China, as the exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message has spread that Liu was seriously ill and brought the Nobel Committee to express his hope for a conditional release and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 domain Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, since Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But Singapore should be considered as a city according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister said that many people criticised the domination of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports Singapore to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people get an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we were different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to twist the logic of defending the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and sacrificed to create this precious land, we hear that we don't have any country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a fleeing from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons given by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system from Singapore with other 'normal countries', he seemed undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, both cities which are led permanently from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the subject again, the good old Leier appears from the authoritarian ruling leaders, the pretended logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week of Shanmugam we gave answers to his American guests in the press, our Judikative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate questions he cloaked with non-answers economically.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng who urges Shanmugam to clear his mind as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I think it's a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, it is a city so that country belongs to our city...</seg>

<seg id="1709">By releasing the comment on the blog, it refers to the reviews that you should begin to understand the entire coming of the conference, in order to understand the context of the testimony of Shanmugam better with which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please read the script.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is rather a "city" than a country, "he declared why the elections in Singapore are so uneven important even if we are looking forward to free and just elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the U.S. (and as many of these cities witnessed a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore is no country, "he obviously not meant it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment of Shanmugam, who makes a leader of a growing generation, such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice has said in Singapore, very provering...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I did with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde what I expected - unless I agree with them or not, but that is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of Singapore's political leaders, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review stalls the weak points of Shanmugram yoga monuments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr Shanmugam "committed a mistake" in a devout mistake or was it a frightened jection?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are regarded as independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both Country and City.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the framework of the Cabinet, the testimony of Mr. Shanmugam are of great importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Singapurer make their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our prime minister?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personal ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">, refer to the Journey of a Decade for affirmation of Singapore and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This movement seems to have been much worse of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series, covered with rumors of certain parts of the world, and a different facet should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most asked me in Japan, is: "are you an American?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, sorry," I am coming. "I come from Canada." since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation occurs, it is regarded as polite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">Following my clarification, then follow the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature". many cancers may be cluttered if they are held for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that Canadians distinguishes us from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many canadians make a Canadian flag well visible in their rucksack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">American however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was even when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and on September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gay marriages are legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everyone seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is considered as the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadian are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I admired many American friends who I admired so much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would not make me anything if you would switch to the example with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, considered "nice," says basically to be spicable - as the benignant, gentle, but forcomplish figure of ed Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has an own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada would really be a nation of full people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem exists that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no edges and edges, nothing where you can stumble.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting, and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good, if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, far from the things that happen around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free, and alone, a main characteristic of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own business.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders are considered "nice," perhaps just daring politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canoes never talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">The warm hearty, open kindness, which I now connect to my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) then Justin Trudeau said the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our Prime Minister has made Canada just sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A popular pop-band was published in Thailand, that the Junta parodian who took power in 2014 and reproduce the power in spite of their promises, continue to reigate the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phake Girl) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules him make his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video also relates indirectly to the ongoing military power of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days alone, the video loaded on Facebook was divided by 1,254 times and received 8.800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin-Video "Der Dictator" was blocked in Thailand, after a group of activists stripped the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, as it is the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these photos of the video, which refer to some of the political topics, which Thailand has continued in the last three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" may refer to the drastic section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which makes the chief commander of the army absolute decision-making authority over important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program of "Settings" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are viewed as a critic.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal, whose vague and unclear rules are often utilized by the authorities to ban activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose a new unit was set up in the army, which supervised online content and tossed people who accused the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand puts a strict appeal against "Lese Majority" (Majesty).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, Thailand was proclaimed the war of martial law.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta continued to purchase is to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts told they that purchasing is unnecessary and a waste of tax credits.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video even shown as people are thrown into a black van, before they bring them into an internment camp, another troubleshooting.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened to offend the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the Teaser showed members of the band, which imitioned the salts from "The Tribute von Panem," which was already used by putsch opponents during protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1805">Over 20 years have passed since the Georgian-abian war officially ended, but his scars are still visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The deserted villages of the northern suburbs in Tkuarchal are showing striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the carbon basin of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Several ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, abasies, Georgier and Armenians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today most Russians and Abchases live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements is also called ghost towns in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war years there were more than 10,000 people here, but today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the population's total population totalled 16,000 people after barely increased over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1819">The empty five-storey blocks from the Soviet Union from the early 60s, called Khrushteleckowkas, are symbolically representing the decline and devastation of the region.</seg>
<seg id="1820">The buildings are fallen and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families.</seg>

<seg id="1823">At the entrance of the village of Dzhantukha I met a native older man.</seg>
<seg id="1824">He starts a conversation and it becomes difficult to end this.</seg>
<seg id="1825">"all this is a consequence of war."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"can I talk to you?" "why speak?</seg>
<seg id="1827">It is still unique. "</seg>
<seg id="1828">Before the war the village was full of life.</seg>
<seg id="1829">There were community centers, schools and kindergartens who served all of the community.</seg>
<seg id="1830">Now there is only paved road with foothed magnificence buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1831">People who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union, meanwhile abandoned the district.</seg>
<seg id="1832">In the ghost town of Dzhantukha, approximately fifty inhabitants live.</seg>
<seg id="1833">About 38 people live in Akarmara, in the other villages it looks similar.</seg>
<seg id="1834">The Khrushchev, which is still one or two families host, one recognizes on the balconies, where the laundry is dry.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Two young girls, both seven years old, look out of the window of a destroyed house.</seg>
<seg id="1836">When you discover me with the camera in your hand, they immediately move back.</seg>

<seg id="1839">The girl whispers on her friend, and suddenly they leave the destroyed house and disappear.</seg>
<seg id="1840">Many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called Tkuarchalugol.</seg>
<seg id="1841">Families are also involved in the substancial sector (cultivation of agricultural products for own space) such as livestock husbandry, beekeeping and vegetable farming.</seg>
<seg id="1842">It's difficult to come across the rounds.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The District Administration delivers free candles and bread to the villages in winter.</seg>

<seg id="1851">"if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house, it is very hard to survive," she gives.</seg>
<seg id="1852">Aunt Galya tells us that she and other village people try to meet regularly and celebrate holiday together.</seg>

<seg id="1894">In Mexico, "Mum Africa" hosts migrants in their long journey</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and will be published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Along the way of migrants attempting to cross Europe or Latin America, certain places will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican girl, a small woman with a coring pink dolls and golden earrings in teddy bear.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is named ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, many know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has nothing of charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 Dollar the night will sleep in simple rooms, with ground floor, slipping walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">There is a parrots in a cage in the anteroom.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs RamÃ­rez sums up the people in full minibuses and from the top part of the coast they begin to cry out: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently it is rather quiet but in this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some of them slept perfectly on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to reject nobody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick leave them medication they could not pay them massaging them with a balm that drew you out of the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived at a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mom Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurt-beard) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came to Brazil from Angola and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">She travels along with his sister, she hopes to go to Boston where to get her husband and her three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans that are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companion from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells the Haitians and Africans often travel the track together and that Africans are already talking on WhatsApp by Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weakened, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to purchase the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he is in contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mum Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always be in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells you that their guests often send text messages when they continued to grate them or to report her about the course of their trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only sparks of hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken one of the immigrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the Bustickets can be sold to many African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on floors on the ground, but at least they have electricity, washing machine and a kitchen outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells us. "I have experienced what they experienced.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">Having lived for three years, he was expelled to a raid on his work place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels from Tapachula, comes from Central America and other residents are opening the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he braided him with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to blackmail the money, without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single one, offered him roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family lives and is still trying to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back in full.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses are travelers quiet their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy to be happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of which you left.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she petalled her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair brains which made her a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs, while she stops her for a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya sis" eron, "they repeat every time." they have already gone. "</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are compelled to install a monitoring app on their cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-Point for personal communications tools in Xinjang from Twitter users to hand in the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities in western China, is compelled to install a spyware on their cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the cell phone users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi was given a mobile telephone notifications in which the district government indicates a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In this notice, it is said that the app will allow you to get access to terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the app has even used to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women have been arrested in Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because she, shortly after she had installed the app, had messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app would determine and follow the sources and distribution channels of terrorists together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwane's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to carefully read users how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app, using the minors for minors, should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could manipulate public actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures for the control of digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the bigger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote areas such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit inrest and dissatisfaction in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censored and surveillance measures as well as regular internet circuits.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media-based media outlet "Images from" China "(set-in mind), the censored news published in China, showed the users randomly checked the inhabitants at random if they had installed the supervision app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you're detected on a Checkpoint using one device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have compelled people to use devices who are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by mate technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China again.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from the China" (set-in mind screams) also published a Jingwang product description, which shows that the software can lift up a Windows operating system and get unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang computers and cell phones in Xinjiang are used to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party councillor to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office on the operation of their computer and communication equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report by Freedom House, a U.S. American Human Rights Organisation, also mentioned the new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a decree to all residents and entrepreneurs, until August 1, their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" to be registered at the local police.</seg>

<seg id="1994">This is the first of six reports in the row "sleep or death," in which the activist Sarmad Al Jilane signs his experiences in a Syrian prison.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Far from our blue, virtual world, you feel that you are entirely alone in a place where all important is vanished.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Everything went after and after disbanded, and a truth revealed that clearly recognisable, both from inside and outside.</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that makes all honor her name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has suppressed in a list of feelings and expressions that don't allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">But when the reality goes back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the play, the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters into being made of flesh and blood, and all cries to death.</seg>
<seg id="2000">All doubt release in smoke and you will become aware of your existence, even if the earth is turned on on the axis of the unheel. dir is clear that you are caught here between the walls, which have built your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone by stone.</seg>
<seg id="2001">They arrested me and my father three times, but that was not enough for me to give "my lesson" as the head of safety services - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="2002">He ordered his power over us, as he even destroyed the simplest concepts that we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five teenagers have been torn out during a peaceful protest like weeds from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough to bring the city the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2005">All the districts have coveted, just my own.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time it was quiet, rainy times, even if I didn't set high demands on a city that is uplifting up into the arteries with government security and its accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night things had calmed down, after the power supply in the district ceased to function.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke through the silence by crying several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice upset by the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later, some of my friends felt brave enough to be together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Many friends, real friends joined me, we allied to a gorgeous photo, full of my expectations and filled it all.</seg>
<seg id="2013">In such a moment, you are aware that you liberated the spirit from the lamp, but it simply is not interested in the least.</seg>
<seg id="2014">I received a call from my father: "make you ready, we meet our military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He placed on.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I got the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can return your voice after you have made it all the way to the office of security from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan was there with several of his men; my father was already there, as I do now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The colonel of Ghassan begins to talk: "don't let me hear how you scream" Allahu ', or you're only brave enough, if we are not nearby. "</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hurt eyes were built on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and you are sad about what to look in my eyes, and not on the ground!"</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then did not do anything with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood before this building.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Perhaps it was on my folly, vanity; perhaps in the revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure when I answered, "I didn't think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">And I think I have never ceased to look at your eyes, so why should I do it now? "</seg>
<seg id="2027">It was the shortest conversation, which could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I regret not a word from what I said.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"in solitary and his father hides him with it."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his Father same as that."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this curse lies between me and the nose today.</seg>
<seg id="2031">He became a "syndrome," a mental torture, which I was exposed for months months.</seg>
<seg id="2032">I'm through the farm.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I carry with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Then again by the farm and into the second office which leads through a corridor to the single cells.</seg>
<seg id="2035">I had a look at all details before I cared for the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise they probably agreed to a larger cell in this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share with only one another prisoners with only one prisoner, without waiting for their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">After a few minutes felt like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I grabbed an old proven method of communication: with his fist on the wall.</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learnt that my Hellenic was a "sthgathering."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long cohesion he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently, none of the surrounding cells was a reputable man middle age who looks similar to me and called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">In perfect dark, there are no striking faces of me, and doctors are not giving it here; we are all just numbers.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"perhaps someone whose voice sounds like mine sounds?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers interconnect his existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will stop immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had assured me they would fret him when I stay.</seg>
<seg id="2048">LÃ¼gner.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would have had a scarecrow in order to dispel all these crows that are labelled on the fruit in the garden of my head labs.</seg>
<seg id="2050">In the distance, I can still scream "Allahu" Akbar. "</seg>

<seg id="2060">I am accustomed to me, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really can't say exactly when insults and blows after a friendly talk for me become a common communication tool.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how it happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Any voice in me told me that I had to get used to it, to be punished, although I didn't do anything to make this sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Punishment in all its diversity.</seg>

<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables to present us from their viewpoint, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the most of its time inside; once again he slips to his canvas, once again his computer, and again also to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigar between his fingers or his mouth with nicotine stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which had belonged to them since 1967; the year where Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank, and Hevaibs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felahyeen (approximately: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who has been transferred to the conservative majority against gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which deals often with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian civil servants, he also urges out the core of the whole Arab world. all these issues cannot be found in his home town of Amman, but also in cities which from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa within Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking by borders, and he can feel according to his own statement with people who have suffering from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he does not open it openly, he gives a special dislike against the US-American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war zones whose identity as "Palestinian escapes of the second generation - so called himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own living conditions," emphasizes Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I'm a human being, while in the water dissolved NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. during this time it is envisaged for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordan law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal in Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Generally speaking the lofeit of coffee and the snaps of Kent cigarette in the nose are primarily free of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky above all, when looking at a glance into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it simply avoids basic things to do - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to not land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has canceled a gig of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2112">Minor and former spokesperson for the press in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert "has just been cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many say also, the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is the most dangerous activism of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila captivates the jordan people as a "progressive supporters of human rights" which continues to stand "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be easy to disrepair rhetoric, but actually a clear crystallized reality in Jordan reflected in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib destroyed traditional generations of gender equality by killing his vision of the fate of Arab women to have vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows a skeleton of a obviously reboasted unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch down to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives by the hands of them they actually have to trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan, Jordan has risen the number of 'honours' from the unofficial outward in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch listed their climax in 2016. however, the number of honours reached its zenith in 2016. however, the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women who tried to attempted murder, or domestic violence to an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law against crime in 1954, women who are subjected to the danger of infamily violence, "in indefinite period of time," and for her release is often a yearlong bureaucratic effort and the guarantee provided by the family, that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs Music also enjoys great popularity and is well known to shrink not from topics that are taboo in his country for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but he dreamt of having his music, which is full of explicit incentives on sexuality, freedom, and freedom of expression is not split by politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">To me, politics became installer, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa ', Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In turn, "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs which are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse repeatedly follows:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is there."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get in his words "that can be" - whether there is faith or failure, Heteroe or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hard someone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality of LGBTQ + individuals has been deeply censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan Onlineage Roya in order to remember that his comments were ripped in the context, and in his opinion were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a reworked version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance to homosexuals did not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nubian, a poet of the eighth century who still remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nubian could work later on behalf of the Caliph, in the eighth century could be openly described above homosexuality, why can Jordan not do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila, or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashish realm, there is nothing new that the government urges attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive votes were brought into silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian press government took several former government officials and members of the teaching, with the reasoning, they had reportedly criticised the problems with the problems of corruption in the country in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaibs concert is according to only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to provoke a structural change in the next generation of Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent key and taking. Jordan, Mashrou'Leila is now fighting for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so there is Hdaib. it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the jordan society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without interventions.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He is not only dreaming about his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of taking them. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is called up with music, art and literature of a real and basic openness - and not by bombs, streamed partitions and on artificial manner of guided democracies. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is so far, Hdaib will continue to rap and thus also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta to Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant wardmen are as fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that there is a variation of Tanabata festival, which is usually done in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory of which the drums, the drums and the dance of more than one thousand years have been invaded the northeast, in order to conquer the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to pick up a few great seats, so we have a super view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can imagine only how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Megan Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition of Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Asjoen again for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true and this way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18-metre-high car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rare, outer appearance and body care were as important as in this history, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth from crime, and a legitimate job as to promote the warder.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where road crashes and illegal drug trafficking are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 was that 51.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance, and therefore also the fallen hairstyle of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Chile), Arturo Vidal (Chile), has led to more and more normal hands in the experienced hands of hairstyles that can form these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme bounds of fantasy and creativity, has even an annual event inspired by the competition of hairdressing "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts oppose each other to show who can create the most eccentric Looks, as you can see in the following video (further videos to current competitions this can be found on the public Facebook profile of Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to change their weapons against hair tools and instead of bad advice would have a training in hairstyle that enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the numerous ways, dozens of young people saw that they can seize a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district of which we are very proud of, because of love for the children we have built this educational community.</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the contribution "Liebesmessages to Guerillakians," published by the International Online Magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who feel cast out and creating affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This was exactly the question that the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios of the Young-Youth Foundation are no longer inspired by the head and inspired her to write letters by the Young People's Cartas por la REYouraciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), the young people encouraged letters to write letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their land was the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces Kolumbiens) which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered as the result of peace agreement as so important that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">In front of Columbus, however, there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillary people who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to a rhetoric, and in around the clock, they have to integrate their weapons into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which has accustomed to life in continuous fear and in some cases of deep hatred against guerrilla comers, has now begun to hold them in their ranks and support them when designing a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had joined together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign's goal is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla - which will then be personally handed over.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was presented at the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize in BogotÃ¡, which was held in February 2017 in BogotÃ¡. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those forget that they need much more needed.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, told it to share his love with people that needed the most urgent attendance.</seg>

<seg id="2199">More than 2000 letters were collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i've never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN storage in the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogotokreists to the camp to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves how they had used to meet the instructions of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's unbelievable, how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between," told the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we handed over the letters, a former soldier led me to the guerilla war camp.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambusch" (a kind of hut, in which the guerilla had living) I saw a guerrilla who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because beside him there was a MGL-Granatcher, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">And I asked him, saying, "Hello, what do they just do?" he said, "I answer a letter which someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It's a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written me something so beautiful, so I answer it. "there suddenly tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the headlamps.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry, because he was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion to this fighting, and would help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I only learned how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now there is peace, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">As a prelude, students and some cordings of the FARC were gathered for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grew up as already war and the FARC already existed.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">For one goal of this magnitude it is worth coming to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, does me sore.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comfort me that all men - even those who have killed, and so much damage to us, give us something and a smile and a hug you can give.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono Cauca, wrote in the example of DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Kolumbianians was prophesied that after the disarmament peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are willing to lift up and stand up for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now set at peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all the defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a land in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from my own experience that nothing is easy. those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence will be a lot of difficulty coming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2256">One day, I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who put in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While trying to help her, somebody, of whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents, and spread it all over the Internet, with the following message: "so there are no males in Chechnya that can remove these shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">Then the photos of my documents by the WhatsApp made the Round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing it, a few grocery bags came from the backseat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and awoke up last end in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had to get everything and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">I learned in the hospital that I had two stitches in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you placed - in whom the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name; but the doctor left and laid me for the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For that I am very grateful.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim name, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got a threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - Related, strange, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya, to prove that it was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd Demands: some said me, I have to prove it by up the roads; others wanted me to rise up in the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was only bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once said my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, which has not just damaged your family but the whole republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you, because you are a religious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">In my mother it became too much and she placed a cord around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbors arrived and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and just a few hours later, under the window was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checking the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">I left the country with their help, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mum when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registration, without notice, without notice.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and she threw it in the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered for a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you do not believe about you would be safe, but because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you are set. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the gender equality, this is a table theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still have some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Also I wish to overcome this spiritual barrier, I cannot overcome these spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother's in life, I will do my best to do not harm you.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chatting with camera I actually give myself trouble as to see how the person remembers them out of their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For whom I needed more information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to somebody who served one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that while Ramadan was arrested, he was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So, I think they probably recharge the relative, they take care of the problem with the affected person and end of demand a proof that the so-called "glory" has experienced by blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men even now detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there is not a lot.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all those who have no wealthy relative, or that were left by their relatives to question Gaddafi's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are kept there to be presenting them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked some village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not just vanished, but purposefully dipped to radicalize himself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a guess or have you a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown your beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was even when they were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now they were not introduced as bandits, and there were no reports to date. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why wouldn't we have allowed this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think it was already known in 2003 when I was still living in Grosny - and I never had any problems there.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">From 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was applied, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The fact that Russia originally wanted to manage the fascination, but ultimately takes us back into the stone period.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is that possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were adpped; I had colorized lashes, bore bore and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security department of the sharia has never bent me just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met with me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Save not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children, if they make fun of sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so, they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed they were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted, never chased, never beaten me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace be fulfilled?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov appeared to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk on TV via Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us by se, but primarily through women's behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Still - you could feel how people started to change in town.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who was thwarted and laughed at once, suddenly watching herself with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">During the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I'm still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize tea ffs, gatherings, I donate them to the hospital and help them to get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I dragged refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you have an Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is alickers.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So is nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">It is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no flailing in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans, which have the Cabins, have the Russians and the Russians. on the whole planet it is - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I am from there, so it is unpleasant to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here as many men out of the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and during Ramadan, live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think of transiveness to men, the men love, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a truer.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact, different habitats.</seg>
<seg id="2391">It is the most important thing for me to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I am so personal myself, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than one year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn an increase of suicide bombers within the poverty-paced Arab dazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian civil population suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the past few months there is a strong increase of self-moral.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab Workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self burning process of a man called Jassim Moramazi on 27 August retroarded the desperate situation of the Arab world Nazi community of Iran, marked by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra, the region of Ahraz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he chooses for his own helplessness to bring the inability to his family, so Ahwazi calls for human rights to remain anonymous and anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube was able to ignite the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly creating the flames and Moramazi was brought into the village of Ahraz in the village of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August inside the Arabian Moreazi minority, and activists from the spot would warn that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed falah Moussawi and ShaytBani Tamim - have been imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who felt because of the persecution by the Iranian government, trusted and unable to keep their families and follow a safe job.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is a major part of the Arab anazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to deny its living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">Before a century, the Arab world was an autonomous region of Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 he took great effort to finish the ethnic autonomy in all Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, some of the largest in Iran are present in oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most recognised and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continued to develop only slowly, and the native population only gets less from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated disease, hunger and discharges.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime uses systematic jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams, the waters of Arab areas in the Persian fields, where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have led only to destroy the devastation caused by dryness, and destroying local farming as well as the local farming and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab AHawaizi youth has now risen to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, an Iranian general manager for cooperative work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed the primary school, completed 55% having completed a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aim to destroy the mind of national resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian human rights activist with residence in London, reported that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, leads to a" high increase, "the number of self-moral among the young ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="2423">DuDohimi said that especially the unemployment has gotten worse, this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the integration process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions are not preferred by Arab labour, the local Arab Ahift will have access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regimes, to destroy the spirit of national resistance to young Arabs and to force her living outside of their home ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their origin and surname to hide their belonging to the Ancazi who are not tolerated as even Arabic name in the workplace will not be tolerated, for speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing of arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances, which the Arab genealogy had to endure, human rights activist alarm, before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ayomide back and originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who pretend themselves as intersecular feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay out well thought scientific and social arguments from me, why I should be feminist and why we generally see all feminist *.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money despite the same education as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observations when it comes about what they are allowed to do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>

<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of this and I wear double and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I'm a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I speak on skin color, on black Cis women, to black women from the Diaspora women or to black women from the Diaspora; when I mention, in which kind of being physically, mental and verbal, many white feminists leave to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they are all agree that women - all women - come together to "lift up their voices and 'Kumbaya,' my lord 'to sing' in order to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about it in addition to sexualised violence a realized form of racially motivated violence that we are subjected to black women on two different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other fields of origin do less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The black girl and girls with an immigrant background often referred to the school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women are exposed in black spheres and women with an immigrant background with higher risk, domestic violence and violence in partnership to suffer as white women.</seg>

<seg id="2454">I am exhausted, and will no longer fight my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented spell that has opposed me and countless other black women and always turned back.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Sojourner complained in their speech: "I am not a wife?" and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an horrified and marginalized being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and ways to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to settle some white women the importance of the overlapping of skin color and gender. because some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honour a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the interctionist feminism was founded to give a home to women different origin and disnarrow from white feminism, feminism is still the word "feminism."</seg>
<seg id="2459">I draw it before, and disconnect myself to the movement of Womanism, which was brought to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that interctionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women according to our own ideas and give ourselves to the spheres that we are created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves in this way as we can defend ourselves in this way and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and interctionale feminists will immediately call Separatism and Exclusion when they read these lines, please inform you about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my being.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in a environment in which my life is neither ignored, nor ignored, nor turned down.</seg>

<seg id="2468">This article will be published again as part of a publisher's content management agreement.</seg>
<seg id="2469">Again Nabil Musa in the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in the canoe - with a special request by the Kurdistan in Iraq. his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary from Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," Musa tells Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct sovereign debt crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is involved and working on it, "to protect the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq as well as to support the local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question: "if we had no water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was produced and edited by Emily Kinskey, a documentary film orchestrated in Erbil, Iraq, and multi-media journalist.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The emphasis of their work lies on expelled, little accents and new multi-media techniques, with their help suppressed municipalities that can tell their stories about their way.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and reworked version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# Welicheinefood) which about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police station, Ada BÃ¡ez, said that she could not have been working against Luis Balbuena, her partner who would have been violent against him.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship there was a little time passed and the police said, her testimony would not be put into the files, but you can't do any more.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another woman Balbuena was showing because of mistrements, the advertised display of Ada BÃ¡ez was nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman drew its display back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women are going to display, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of women admit to be victims of violence, to be victims of violence at all.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to find how many women are truly harassed in the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudio, a societal research institution in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports, but they do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the figures available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Attorney General went up 9600 advertisements due to domestic violence. at 70% it went by violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads in the police came by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5000 advertisements because of domestic violence in the peace stories. here also 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics however do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan female Minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these offences are actually indicated. "on every woman who is published in Paraguay for psychological abuse, come 9 women who do not.</seg>
<seg id="2498">For every woman who is cancelled because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this, "declared the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murders of Paraguay is not an own criminal offender, the prosecution enforcement agencies have not been appropriately documented, as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists attended at least 12 cases of murders in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay has at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, Paraguay runs every ten days a woman because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible misdeeds and an legal system that doesn't undertakes anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez has been the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called it the name of all its former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want it, but she was still looking for.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and has not been together with Carlos. but for two years she bore mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would once be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I thought that only women happens to be dignified because they deceive of violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report about the mistral of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Calling name, she wrote contributions on Facebook in which she described his insults and several attacks during their two year relationship, and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos even. he asked the rhetoric, whether he had ever raised his hand against it and refused to admit that his behaviour also was a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had enjoyed the so long time Carlos and did not leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It almost seemed as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least had a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay has fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partners were intreated.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that is of women all in some way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimony of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias's case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's readings in the authorities remained without a result and also from her relatives, she didn't get support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a trial against its former partner who developed into an imperforable legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country where it mainly went about money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay: good approach, faulty implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws which are very good, but not used.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The display of mistreacts is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, provides great problems with the use of laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016 a bill of law was discussed in the paraguayan Parliament, known under the hashtag # Porelas (# FÃ¼ry).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and Movement # NiUnaMenos (# NonEineProvide) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law sees to explain Femizid an independent offender and punish it, as already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the lawsuit was changed in a few points, in order to also capture the deputies for the law that is denied the way for decriminalization of abortions that are currently prohibited in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill has planned to carry out much of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs which must pay the victims of violence even if they just want to report and receive a safe accommodation in the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law may not be effective if the legislature has no sufficient financial means at your disposal:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreage is seen as part of interhuman relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a change must be held, so violence is no longer considered to be a bit Normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent in the face of these facts turns his guilty, bearing the perpetrators tapping the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must report so long, until failure does not apply any more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law have been changed, but amongst others, a passage was cancelled, which provoked the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes are turning apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section relating to reconciliation was seen as the opportunity for the aggressor, its victims again attack.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The match of the words "sex," "political force" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is considered a great setback.</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the shortened and reworked version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# Welicheinefood) which about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Most names were changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Independent media in Oman have continued attacks on Oman a year according to a newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2546">"this site was closed due to a decision by the Information Minister." read on the website of the banned journal Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than one year ago the American authorities closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn because of their coverage through corruption in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison where he served a year-old prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors from Azamn, Ibrahim al-Maamari, and zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and charged in court but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">In 1970, Oman is governed by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had his father, Said ibn Taimur, having set a coup d "Ã©tat.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Minister of Defense, Minister of Defence, Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council and the President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The dominion of sultans is marked by the persistence of security forces, especially the domestic blissance, including press freedom, inclusion and human rights defenders, independent journalists, blogger and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities stop peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights, including activists, also to express their views on public affairs of the country like corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, her closure and the arrest of three of their editors in the last year, is a hard blow for freedom of press in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper that has been reported in Oman (an absolute monarchy) since its foundation in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim al-Maamari, chief editor of Azamn, was confirmed, after in the newspaper on July 26, 2016, an article entitled "high-level parties to bind hands on the judiciary, and the intervention of senior officers in judicial decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report government officials were accused of having placed Justice of the Supreme Court in Oman, a verdict in a lawsuit.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, zahn Al-Abri, Member of the Board of Directors, was charged by the ISS before the special department and arrested by security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS had taken the vice-chief editor Yousef Al-Haj who had served as Chief Editor for Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The paper was concluded in indefinite period, after the Information Security issued the order that "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper had been banned from any way, including online, from 9th August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial was held in Mascat's trial in the trial against Al Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Tribunal sentenced three journalists to prison and ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Majoari and Al-Haj were both convicted of a disturbance of the public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "undermining of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Moreover al-Haj was found guilty of the injury to an audience and the slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars), in addition to one-year vocational ban imposed on the two journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year of prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after it was found guilty of using "an information network for spreading the material, which could be found guilty for public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a deposit was set in the amount of 5000 star Rial (13 000 US dollars) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Chamber pronounced al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, sentenced Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari in prison for six months.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 in the absence of his six-month prison sentence in Mascat. al-Haj remained in prison, where he served his one-year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the Ministry of Information to conclude the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the court to leave Azamn, the paper continues to look after attacks by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued a statement showing the closure of "Azamn" for three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of the "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, with which the Minister presented himself another time against the decision of the Appeals Court to publish the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuous closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only ones in which Oman has been violating the freedom of freedom in Oman.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowcreatine and the exercise of pressure on albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country, include, for example.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the arrest of journalists Al-Haj, the impression that the omanic authorities are still not willing to end a comprehensive violation of press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Center for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the omanic authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj willingly and liberate unconditional release;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn to be able to retire its journalists in their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. the freedom of press in the land to protect and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. under all circumstances, Human Rights defenders and journalists in Oman have hindered their lawful rights work unhindered and without fear of retaliation measures, including judicial cicans.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The Gulf Center for Human Rights (Gulf Center for Human Rights, GCHR) is an independent, non-profit and non-state organisation, the human rights defenders (also independent journalists, blogger, lawyers, etc.) in the Gulf region and its right to gather together peacefully and provides protection for them.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustration taken with the agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media, making it a growing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need of medical research there are two reasons: for lack of global health care, many medicines and vaccines which cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the poorest countries of Africa are far more serious than elsewhere, and lack of investment for exploring these diseases caused by the pharmaceutical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research which is carried out by African scientists itself is helping to build its own research capacity in Africa. greater role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Centre for Research of Infectious Disease in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia where AIDS epidemic was the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, and in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he was involved in the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the most beneficial health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Waer speaks as private owner).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the use of research results. I assist the sambish national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I can even start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion of important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always keep the receiver, instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get are often not suitable in our area, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does funding and support occur?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it adequate?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are encouraged differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or here, because the financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research project you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not conform to the standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water, and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory equipment is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students from all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is a need for special academic education, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computing sciences, big data, research and welfare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: many times are the limited speed of doing things, and the readest access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that periodicals make articles available only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has already been bred to the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredder, the first plant that has been grown and consumes by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In almost 20 years, Morton's work was granted only by its own ingenuity and question, as many Salatars can get borders.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he noted that more salads were always patented and that he could not continue to breeders for them.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only suitable for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years more and more such patents have been applied on more plants such as grain or antiters. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmental protector and experts help ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still bred Salad, he's needed some time since his work is increasingly difficult because of its work.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is like a boulders would lie in a river around which I have to cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we must do that now, but it is a split with the growing tradition, "he says." I think that patents will go far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they are standing before a court, nobody can breed a new Salatsorte because all features are already patented. "it is as good as possible and tries to breed the features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very cautious and strives to use no material, which is protected as a spiritual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also been connected to a movement which is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeders).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the international space station ISS have bred and eaten red tube salts in the "greenhouse" at the station. there it is tested if plants can be grown into space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounded rather than it would come from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, providing alternative sources to the protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and are so suitable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeders could also commit themselves to freely use seed free of seed.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Board member, Jack Kloppenburg have control over the seed and the possibility to grow new plants, important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed also plays a role in larger relations such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by destroying seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic agriculture or Monsanto and Monsanto or Monsanto and Bayer in August 2016 should also know that the way for example is being offered on farmers markets, such as such vegetables are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative committed themselves to keep other seed alive free of charge. therefore, its approach in contrast, seeds and plant features are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, employed himself in her PhD thesis with genetetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that around one-third of all the carrot features are protected as a intellectual property, making it either nonuseable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are still no estimates, but experts such as Luby suspect that massive crops such as wheat are patented as wheat or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of sight</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so cultivated that they produce specifically undesirable features - from such, through which their taste or their color improves up to such, because they can flourish in certain environments, such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders take more and more patents present. currently, because of climate change, the changing conditions are much worse than ever before, because the changing conditions are much worse than ever.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email, Monsanto Specherin Carly Scaduto acknowledge that genetic variability is generally important and also important for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four conbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company realizes the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">She does, however, contradicts the mind that to promote intellectual property other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant types of plant will promote innovation." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often, these instructions help others to come with another method at the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">So such protection does not inhibits innovations but encourages them to provide more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees that different: 20 years of waiting, until a patent protected, encouragement certainly not provide innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow on plants, that are adapted to the revised environmental conditions, the struggle would have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources should have been a general well and it should continue to remain: "independent Plant Breeders" have neither time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us out, and it will be impossible for us if we are not able to use the best and most genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">Overall, Morton sounds in the concept of patrons, plant features are patented: "we don't really create features.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants build them up themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of cultivators: "one who has grown a sorbate has also bred its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, which produce grown herbicide are cultivated and cultivated in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very genealogy. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (those that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, also without denying it or they keep it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton's opinion is that breeders would be innovative by the avoidance of plant patentatives: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need constantly new material to my catalog, since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years ago, "he says." with a patent, it is 20 years prior to competition, how to make it quite simply in my opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the United States seem to be leader in the "Open Source" breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which itself describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources, develops a "open source" seed program and helps them to grow new varieties, which meet certain requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2686">The German Organization Agree is working on an "open-source" license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that the conventional cultivated plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks for the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits patents on conventional plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, there is no law yet; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to put this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, at the farmers, operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa, to learn about the "Open Source" seed movement and the global trend towards the pattern of seeds.</seg>

<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international Nonprofit development organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database for seeds and biodiversity worldwide in order to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a union of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others have to make a report to promote and improve the seed politics to ensure a stable supply of food.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report, the importance of a diverse, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is emphasised - a link, by the Luby of Ossi tries to see him soon more people.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement of regional and ecological foods is particularly considering how and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly any role played," says Luby. "we now try to realise the human being that there is more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Even the Egyptian authorities unlock the content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a Human Rights Organisation and the blog of a columniest column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend at the 05.August, the Egyptian government filed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt, and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August the network released a statement on Facebook where it was sharply criticized by the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>

<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked no more than two months of 21 pages, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, Arabic language edition of Al Jazeera because of alleged "supporting terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of webmasters has fallen for the victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZDOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, columnists and Human Rights Research Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt's blog.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that it is not available for web sites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he directed to bypass the Censurge of the Egyptian government, was the aim of a attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the supplier where also located in Ziadas's blog, on the other hand, is open.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he reported by Egyptian security forces while he reported about the student protests and carried a video on how the police executed physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly turn around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook commentary, Ziada revoiced to the locking by the government and reflecting what this means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Those who make blogs are very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the freeze of blogs are not important for the world, it is nevertheless for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is a success being able to give myself the feeling of an siege to an arrest; an arrest, an attempted murder, obtruce at the National Security Council, called blocking blogs, and any other web site which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only one small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I wish to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after they have locked him and that they have fear of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities detectable up Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this includes technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of vendors, through the allocation of internet censorship and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs began, began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the Government to block and filtering the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation will be worsened that the censored decisions will be taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed against trial against those acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to search for and whom will it next attack?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The people argue.</seg>

<seg id="2754">Some of the headlines are as follows:</seg>

<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and a significant financial situation in 2017, the force of the force at Rio came to the highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The UN Representative Organisation Global Justice even called on the UN to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the detailed reporting about violence in the Rio-known newspaper "Extra" on August 16, the article entitled "This is not normal," in which they failed to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper in this way:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world as murder, robbery, sexual verts, etc. everything that only happens in Rio will be published in the "war in Rio." (...) This is our way to say: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so we do not exclude our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video, which was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor in Chief of the newspaper, that this decision was not a reason for pride, rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra, it is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a ruin in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video explains a journalist of the newspaper that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas, which are subjected to criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">It is aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used, atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions to shed.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" be used more than they?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the News Portal The Intercept Brasil the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argued that violence as a "war" have argued. this in their opinion is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to assume responsibility in the police for accountability.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio yourself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, reconnaissance and a historical and self-neglect of public service.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro is to be called "the most violent place in Brazil," according to CecÃ­lia, according to statistics from 2015, according to statistics from 2015 in north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="2780">Extra, the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, emphasizes the policy of the State's security policy for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">The establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), one of the state governments of the state of Rio in 2003, was to capture a favela by use of a massive police offering and permanently use a unit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">At first this was led to a decrease of violent deaths. in a few years the UPP was opposed to several reports of vulnerability and repressions against poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux said one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not comply with the "civil war" criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">Besides legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio explodes as a serious consequences for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this requires the state to place funds and ways of being typical of a war. this is the intrusion into the territory of an "enemy," with which a civil war is an unsharp point in the landscape and to object for "collating damage" and "mutated bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War or later, fact is that residents of favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week is now that the police found the hill with the favela Jacarezinho favela, in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all these violence he made headlines: an orchard died because of shots, which the police had fired up from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from the brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime to loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institutes, are located in Damascus and in reverse, Homs, Deir Yzzor and Idlib currently, about one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">East Ghouta region is especially strongly affected, where an attack on chemical weapons called for hundreds of civilians by chemical weapons in August 21, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition, are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of Assad was committed.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, this number of rebels controlled areas outside Damascus had been under siege under siege under siege, making them sociated on localized or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">By years of blockade traditional food like meat was inaccessible for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas as they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves ghiras Aldenda and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi are not included among the traditional foods which are planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, it is an attractive dietary source of many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The main objective of this project, comp Nabil, said to the French message agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we opted for the cultivation of fungi because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because you can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reported that for three years he had been fighting this project and squeezed his relief that it is now more and more "gaining an awareness."</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, use the 'Ghiras Aldenda NGO's humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families knowledge of planting pilgrims, so Dr. Leila is to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this writing, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of approx. 12.700 million, but will continue to collect donations from CanDo on Monday, 04. September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators, which hold the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Locally manufactured agents are used locally for fuel, in order to supply the generators with necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices, that they began with the "production of migrating fungal seeds," before they checked their quality and, whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom in a tub. when this was accomplished they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in the East Ghouta for free.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila declared that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese calls for justice for the victims of 2017</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people were protesting in many District Apostles of Portugal on October 21, seeking justice for the victims of fires that occur during the week before the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state institution.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Also fires were registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there have been more than 500 fire-bursts, spread in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, there was a similar tragedy in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest area by satellite TV in 2017, about 500,000 hectares of forest were burnt - an area of the size of the district Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the serious situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2844">The sinewy tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The aim of the protest of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fighting measures by the State.</seg>
<seg id="2846">The people wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral proclaimed the League of farmers in Portugal in the newspaper pÃºblico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After PedrÃ³gÃ£o there were streets and villages for everything and nothing evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did nowhere: there are dozens of open streets, surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria a similar tragedy would happen again as in June, as the streets were closed very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, construction permits will be questioned with high Brandrisiko.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A profound proposal on the forest form, which the government had submitted to severe fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the communes who saw the new rules as obstacle to investments.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a slackening of the law, which allowed the construction activity of case, when the applicant had means of self-guards - that was an open backdoor so that all could be built," JoÃ£o Sorval continued in the same article on the pÃºblico newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environment-organisation Quercus has pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of slightly flammable wood, are still spreading everywhere in a vicious circle, according to the fires of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2855">This event also adds to these problems that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, as habitants sought or tried to contact us, offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative, provided the people with information: they use their own civil protection data using the application of fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was founded in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade, so that the servers pursued the onslaught of the 400,000 users, who pursued the fires, did not last more than half a million.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party, was just murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt sheltered.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban fighters known for their hatred came nearer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohesion pit. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took care of what was left of his low pay, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and sled bags with mortar that were heavier than he himself, to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There weren't any facilities and no heating. we hanged nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't stick at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without a papers in Iran and was ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">For some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in Parks and went to a church who shared twice a day of food to needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy due to relatively high ratings were given a kind of second chance for expired asylum seekers. however, it is true also that the terms that asylum seekers are disastrous in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organization Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of the asylum seekers is accommodated in the more than 3000 "special reception centres." there are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unpreceded personnel. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian Law asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially applied for asylum on asylum, which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money to have an accommodation either on the hospitality of friends, or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">Thus, it was also called Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his imbial life helped Asharaf to free herself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf had his entire savings into the establishment of a youth hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">It was so good that he opened a second hostel for a while, and a fast limb is opened.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">A transitional solution to many of them is transitional solution to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of Afghan companies, including cutlery, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants have been created.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were allotted to the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Oriental experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells of the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghan.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs goals are far beyond the Italian food industry and retail, and aim to travel back to the country that he had forced to leave as teenager.</seg>

<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament checks the bill to see that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to use in order to use the social networks, register and register their full name as well as their ID number within six months of using their complete name as well as their ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who have missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months, or the final punishment of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was advertised by sixty members of Parliament, is currently under legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another deputy of deputy was filed, in which harder sanctions for the insult to the President or a high officials would be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="2937">An Egyptian law is the offing of the President and state institutions already punishable. however, such acts would, however, be punishable by prison and fines, so right-sexed at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law should be adopted, this can mean up to three years "imprisonment for the convicted judges.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Also, this would strengthen political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A distinctive example is the case of the Egyptian photographers Mahmoud ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested by Egyptian policemen as he had been demonstrating violence against protesters who led to the military putsch against the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited so as more than 700 protest delegates that had been arrested on the same incident, four years in prison on a court appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th May, because the prison line failed to bring the accused from prison in the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to an, so many human rights-groups agree, e.g. weapons of arms, illegal assembly, murder and sustain resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza spoke the two journalist Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their coverage for pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya in Cairo.</seg>

<seg id="2949">Which published on April 21 on the website of Nawaat, sheds a light on how the formal plans for the support of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the naming of his sources with stating Article 11 of the Tunisian press code that guarantees the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">However, he joined the Tunis County Court on 09 May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force social media users to present their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new rules of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the user of social media need approval in China before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In addition, the provisions will also be stated that registration will be required to full reproductive name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that by using the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks, it is still unclear as the authorities should apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese networks have proposed in social media to protect these regulations only selective to protect the civil journalism and its independence.</seg>
